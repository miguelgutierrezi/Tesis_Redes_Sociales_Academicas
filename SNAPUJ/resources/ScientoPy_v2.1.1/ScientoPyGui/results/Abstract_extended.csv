,,,1,2-s2.0-85097250289,2020,Regular coffee drinking and cardiovascular risk: A critical review of the literature,"Objective: To analyse and summarise the evidence on the effect of regular coffee drinking on the appearance of cardiovascular disease. Methods: A critical review of the literature was carried out based on a meta-analysis and systematic reviews published in MedLine, EMBASE, Cochrane Database of Systematic Reviews, and LILACS (January 1966 to June 2018). The search, selection, and extraction of the information were performed by two investigators. The quality of the manuscripts was evaluated using AMSTAR. Results: An analysis was made of 4 systematic reviews that considered coronary disease, cardiovascular risk, and myocardial infarction as outcomes. For the first and second outcomes, a reduction in risk was found with consuming 3-4 cups/day (RR = 0.90; 95%CI; 0.84-0.9; P =.02, and RR = 0.85; IC95% CI; 0.80-0.90; P =.09); for 1-2 cups/day (RR = 0.89; 95%CI; 0.85-0.94; P =.83, and RR = 0.89; 95%CI; 0.84-0.94; P =.09), respectively. As regards myocardial infarction, an increase in risk was reported with consuming 3-4 cups/day (OR = 1.75; 95%CI; 1.44-2.14; P =.005) and ≥ 4 cups/day (OR = 2.01; IC95%CI; 1.7-2.36; P <.001). Conclusion: Mild and moderate consumption of coffee has a neutral effect or a reduction in cardiovascular risk and coronary disease. On the other hand, the risk of myocardial is increased with drinking more or equal to 3 cups/day in men. The drinking of up to 3 cups of coffee/day is recommended, and it is not advised to drink more, especially in men.",Article,"Gutierrez, Vanesa.; Penaloza, Maylin.; Unknown.; Unknown.; Badoui, Nora.; Alba, Luz H.elena",Cardiovascular risk;Coffee;Coronary disease;Myocardial infarction;Systematic review,Cardiovascular risk;Coffee;Coronary disease;Myocardial infarction;Systematic review,Colombia,

,,,3,WOS:000591570800009,2021,Solving the one-warehouse N-retailers problem with stochastic demand: An inter-ratio policies approach,"In this paper, we consider a two-echelon supply chain in which one warehouse provides a single product to N retailers, using integer-ratio policies. Deterministic version of the problem has been widely studied. However, this assumption can lead to inaccurate and ineffective decisions. In this research, we tackle the stochastic version of two-echelon inventory system by designing an extension of a well-known heuristic. This research considers customer demands as following a normal density function. A set of 240 random instances was generated and used in evaluating both the deterministic and stochastic solution approaches. Due to the nature of the objective function, evaluation was carried out via Monte Carlo simulation. For variable demand settings, computational experiments shows that: i) the use of average demand to define the inventory policy implies an underestimation of the total cost and ii) the newly proposed method offers cost savings.

,,,3,WOS:000494644100006,2020,Using a hybrid heuristic to solve the balanced vehicle routing problem with loading constraints,"The Vehicle Routing Problem with Loading Constraints (VRPLC) is strongly related to real life applications in distribution logistics. It addresses the simultaneous loading and routing of vehicles, which are two crucial activities in transportation. Since treating these operations separately may result in impractical solutions, the development of applications for VRPLCs has gained the attention of researchers in recent years. Several heuristic methods have been proposed, but they consider only a limited group of practical characteristics that arise in real world situations. This study proposes a hybrid heuristic method based on the Greedy Randomized Adaptive Search Procedure (GRASP) metaheuristic and the Clarke and Wright Savings algorithm, to solve a VRPLC with several loading and routing constraints that have not been considered simultaneously before. Experimental results show that the proposed procedure produces competitive solutions in short processing times. Lastly, the impact of the added operational constraints is also analyzed.

,,,2,WOS:000719401500010,2022,A granular tabu search for the refrigerated vehicle routing problem with homogeneous fleet,"The Refrigerated Capacitated Vehicle Routing Problem (RCVRP) considers a homogeneous fleet with a refrigerated system to decide the selection of routes to be performed according to customers' requirements. The aim is to keep the energy consumption of the routes as low as possible. We use a thermodynamic model to understand the unloading of products from trucks and the variables' efficiency, such as the temperature during the day influencing energy consumption. By considering various neighborhoods and a shaking procedure, this paper proposes a Granular Tabu Search scheme to solve the RCVRP. Computational tests using adapted benchmark instances from the literature demonstrate that the suggested method delivers high-quality solutions within short computing times, illustrating the refrigeration system's effect on routing decisions.

,,,1,WOS:000538430200008,2020,An online real-time matheuristic algorithm for dispatch and relocation of ambulances,"The Medical System of Transportation deals with two online real-time decisions: ambulance dispatching and relocation. Dispatching consists of selecting which ambulance to send to an emergency call; relocation consists of determining how to modify the location of available ambulances in response to changes in the system's state. Although the literature regarding this problem is extensive, only a limited number of online real-time approaches for ambulance management have been proposed, much less one taking into consideration different types of emergencies and vehicles. This paper proposes an online real-time matheuristic algorithm that combines: i) a new preparedness index defined as the availability probability of a multi-server queue model which is used as an optimization objective and as a control variable for relocation strategies, ii) two mathematical models to solve the relocation problem, one oriented to the maximization of coverage and other to the minimization of the maximum relocation time, and iii) two heuristic algorithms oriented to the maximization of the preparedness level, one to solve the dispatch problem and other to solve the location problem of one ambulance. The computational experiments, based on discrete event simulation and historical data of Bogota, Colombia, have shown their capability to adequately respond to the necessities of real-time operation.

,,,3075,2-s2.0-85031727040,2017,"Global, regional, and national age-sex specifc mortality for 264 causes of death, 1980-2016: A systematic analysis for the Global Burden of Disease Study 2016","Background: Monitoring levels and trends in premature mortality is crucial to understanding how societies can address prominent sources of early death. The Global Burden of Disease 2016 Study (GBD 2016) provides a comprehensive assessment of cause-specifc mortality for 264 causes in 195 locations from 1980 to 2016. This assessment includes evaluation of the expected epidemiological transition with changes in development and where local patterns deviate from these trends. Methods: We estimated cause-specifc deaths and years of life lost (YLLs) by age, sex, geography, and year. YLLs were calculated from the sum of each death multiplied by the standard life expectancy at each age. We used the GBD cause of death database composed of: vital registration (VR) data corrected for under-registration and garbage coding; national and subnational verbal autopsy (VA) studies corrected for garbage coding; and other sources including surveys and surveillance systems for specifc causes such as maternal mortality. To facilitate assessment of quality, we reported on the fraction of deaths assigned to GBD Level 1 or Level 2 causes that cannot be underlying causes of death (major garbage codes) by location and year. Based on completeness, garbage coding, cause list detail, and time periods covered, we provided an overall data quality rating for each location with scores ranging from 0 stars (worst) to 5 stars (best). We used robust statistical methods including the Cause of Death Ensemble model (CODEm) to generate estimates for each location, year, age, and sex. We assessed observed and expected levels and trends of cause-specifc deaths in relation to the Socio-demographic Index (SDI), a summary indicator derived from measures of average income per capita, educational attainment, and total fertility, with locations grouped into quintiles by SDI. Relative to GBD 2015, we expanded the GBD cause hierarchy by 18 causes of death for GBD 2016. Findings: The quality of available data varied by location. Data quality in 25 countries rated in the highest category (5 stars), while 48, 30, 21, and 44 countries were rated at each of the succeeding data quality levels. Vital registration or verbal autopsy data were not available in 27 countries, resulting in the assignment of a zero value for data quality. Deaths from non-communicable diseases (NCDs) represented 72·3% (95% uncertainty interval [UI] 71·2-73·2) of deaths in 2016 with 19·3% (18·5-20·4) of deaths in that year occurring from communicable, maternal, neonatal, and nutritional (CMNN) diseases and a further 8·43% (8·00-8·67) from injuries. Although age-standardised rates of death from NCDs decreased globally between 2006 and 2016, total numbers of these deaths increased; both numbers and age-standardised rates of death from CMNN causes decreased in the decade 2006-16 - age-standardised rates of deaths from injuries decreased but total numbers varied little. In 2016, the three leading global causes of death in children under-5 were lower respiratory infections, neonatal preterm birth complications, and neonatal encephalopathy due to birth asphyxia and trauma, combined resulting in 1·80 million deaths (95% UI 1·59 million to 1·89 million). Between 1990 and 2016, a profound shift toward deaths at older ages occurred with a 178% (95% UI 176-181) increase in deaths in ages 90-94 years and a 210% (208-212) increase in deaths older than age 95 years. The ten leading causes by rates of age-standardised YLL signifcantly decreased from 2006 to 2016 (median annualised rate of change was a decrease of 2·89%); the median annualised rate of change for all other causes was lower (a decrease of 1·59%) during the same interval. Globally, the fve leading causes of total YLLs in 2016 were cardiovascular diseases; diarrhoea, lower respiratory infections, and other common infectious diseases; neoplasms; neonatal disorders; and HIV/AIDS and tuberculosis. At a fner level of disaggregation within cause groupings, the ten leading causes of total YLLs in 2016 were ischaemic heart disease, cerebrovascular disease, lower respiratory infections, diarrhoeal diseases, road injuries, malaria, neonatal preterm birth complications, HIV/AIDS, chronic obstructive pulmonary disease, and neonatal encephalopathy due to birth asphyxia and trauma. Ischaemic heart disease was the leading cause of total YLLs in 113 countries for men and 97 countries for women. Comparisons of observed levels of YLLs by countries, relative to the level of YLLs expected on the basis of SDI alone, highlighted distinct regional patterns including the greater than expected level of YLLs from malaria and from HIV/AIDS across sub-Saharan Africa; diabetes mellitus, especially in Oceania; interpersonal violence, notably within Latin America and the Caribbean; and cardiomyopathy and myocarditis, particularly in eastern and central Europe. The level of YLLs from ischaemic heart disease was less than expected in 117 of 195 locations. Other leading causes of YLLs for which YLLs were notably lower than expected included neonatal preterm birth complications in many locations in both south Asia and southeast Asia, and cerebrovascular disease in western Europe. Interpretation: The past 37 years have featured declining rates of communicable, maternal, neonatal, and nutritional diseases across all quintiles of SDI, with faster than expected gains for many locations relative to their SDI.

The Global Burden of Disease 2016 Study (GBD 2016) provides a comprehensive assessment of cause-specific mortality for 264 causes in 195 locations from 1980 to 2016. This assessment includes evaluation of the expected epidemiological transition with changes in development and where local patterns deviate from these trends. Methods We estimated cause-specific deaths and years of life lost (YLLs) by age, sex, geography, and year. YLLs were calculated from the sum of each death multiplied by the standard life expectancy at each age. We used the GBD cause of death database composed of: vital registration (VR) data corrected for under-registration and garbage coding; national and subnational verbal autopsy (VA) studies corrected for garbage coding; and other sources including surveys and surveillance systems for specific causes such as maternal mortality. To facilitate assessment of quality, we reported on the fraction of deaths assigned to GBD Level 1 or Level 2 causes that cannot be underlying causes of death (major garbage codes) by location and year. Based on completeness, garbage coding, cause list detail, and time periods covered, we provided an overall data quality rating for each location with scores ranging from 0 stars (worst) to 5 stars (best). We used robust statistical methods including the Cause of Death Ensemble model (CODEm) to generate estimates for each location, year, age, and sex. We assessed observed and expected levels and trends of cause-specific deaths in relation to the Socio-demographic Index (SDI), a summary indicator derived from measures of average income per capita, educational attainment, and total fertility, with locations grouped into quintiles by SDI. Relative to GBD 2015, we expanded the GBD cause hierarchy by 18 causes of death for GBD 2016. Findings The quality of available data varied by location. Data quality in 25 countries rated in the highest category (5 stars), while 48, 30, 21, and 44 countries were rated at each of the succeeding data quality levels. Vital registration or verbal autopsy data were not available in 27 countries, resulting in the assignment of a zero value for data quality. Deaths from non-communicable diseases (NCDs) represented 72.3% (95% uncertainty interval [UI] 71.2-73.2) of deaths in 2016 with 19.3% (18.5-20.4) of deaths in that year occurring from communicable, maternal, neonatal, and nutritional (CMNN) diseases and a further 8.43% (8.00-8.67) from injuries. Although age-standardised rates of death from NCDs decreased globally between 2006 and 2016, total numbers of these deaths increased; both numbers and age-standardised rates of death from CMNN causes decreased in the decade 2006-16-age-standardised rates of deaths from injuries decreased but total numbers varied little. In 2016, the three leading global causes of death in children under-5 were lower respiratory infections, neonatal preterm birth complications, and neonatal encephalopathy due to birth asphyxia and trauma, combined resulting in 1.80 million deaths (95% UI 1.59 million to 1.89 million). Between 1990 and 2016, a profound shift toward deaths at older ages occurred with a 178% (95% UI 176-181) increase in deaths in ages 90-94 years and a 210% (208-212) increase in deaths older than age 95 years. The ten leading causes by rates of age-standardised YLL significantly decreased from 2006 to 2016 (median annualised rate of change was a decrease of 2.89%); the median annualised rate of change for all other causes was lower (a decrease of 1.59%) during the same interval. Globally, the five leading causes of total YLLs in 2016 were cardiovascular diseases; diarrhoea, lower respiratory infections, and other common infectious diseases; neoplasms; neonatal disorders; and HIV/AIDS and tuberculosis. At a finer level of disaggregation within cause groupings, the ten leading causes of total YLLs in 2016 were ischaemic heart disease, cerebrovascular disease, lower respiratory infections, diarrhoeal diseases, road injuries, malaria, neonatal preterm birth complications, HIV/AIDS, chronic obstructive pulmonary disease, and neonatal encephalopathy due to birth asphyxia and trauma. Ischaemic heart disease was the leading cause of total YLLs in 113 countries for men and 97 countries for women. Comparisons of observed levels of YLLs by countries, relative to the level of YLLs expected on the basis of SDI alone, highlighted distinct regional patterns including the greater than expected level of YLLs from malaria and from HIV/AIDS across sub-Saharan Africa; diabetes mellitus, especially in Oceania; interpersonal violence, notably within Latin America and the Caribbean; and cardiomyopathy and myocarditis, particularly in eastern and central Europe. The level of YLLs from ischaemic heart disease was less than expected in 117 of 195 locations. Other leading causes of YLLs for which YLLs were notably lower than expected included neonatal preterm birth complications in many locations in both south Asia and southeast Asia, and cerebrovascular disease in western Europe. Interpretation The past 37 years have featured declining rates of communicable, maternal, neonatal, and nutritional diseases across all quintiles of SDI, with faster than expected gains for many locations relative to their SDI. A global shift towards deaths at older ages suggests success in reducing many causes of early death. YLLs have increased globally for causes such as diabetes mellitus or some neoplasms, and in some locations for causes such as drug use disorders, and conflict and terrorism. Increasing levels of YLLs might reflect outcomes from conditions that required high levels of care but for which effective treatments remain elusive, potentially increasing costs to health systems.

,,,1298,WOS:000365992600030,2015,"Global, regional, and national disability-adjusted life years (DALYs) for 306 diseases and injuries and healthy life expectancy (HALE) for 188 countries, 1990-2013: quantifying the epidemiological transition","Background The Global Burden of Disease Study 2013 (GBD 2013) aims to bring together all available epidemiological data using a coherent measurement framework, standardised estimation methods, and transparent data sources to enable comparisons of health loss over time and across causes, age-sex groups, and countries. The GBD can be used to generate summary measures such as disability-adjusted life-years (DALYs) and healthy life expectancy (HALE) that make possible comparative assessments of broad epidemiological patterns across countries and time. These summary measures can also be used to quantify the component of variation in epidemiology that is related to sociodemographic development. Methods We used the published GBD 2013 data for age-specific mortality, years of life lost due to premature mortality (YLLs), and years lived with disability (YLDs) to calculate DALYs and HALE for 1990, 1995, 2000, 2005, 2010, and 2013 for 188 countries. We calculated HALE using the Sullivan method; 95% uncertainty intervals (UIs) represent uncertainty in age-specific death rates and YLDs per person for each country, age, sex, and year. We estimated DALYs for 306 causes for each country as the sum of YLLs and YLDs; 95% UIs represent uncertainty in YLL and YLD rates. We quantified patterns of the epidemiological transition with a composite indicator of sociodemographic status, which we constructed from income per person, average years of schooling after age 15 years, and the total fertility rate and mean age of the population. We applied hierarchical regression to DALY rates by cause across countries to decompose variance related to the sociodemographic status variable, country, and time. Findings Worldwide, from 1990 to 2013, life expectancy at birth rose by 6.2 years (95% UI 5.6-6.6), from 65.3 years (65.0-65.6) in 1990 to 71.5 years (71.0-71.9) in 2013, HALE at birth rose by 5.4 years (4.9-5.8), from 56.9 years (54.5-59.1) to 62.3 years (59.7-64.8), total DALYs fell by 3.6% (0.3-7.4), and age-standardised DALY rates per 100 000 people fell by 26.7% (24.6-29.1). For communicable, maternal, neonatal, and nutritional disorders, global DALY numbers, crude rates, and age-standardised rates have all declined between 1990 and 2013, whereas for non-communicable diseases, global DALYs have been increasing, DALY rates have remained nearly constant, and age-standardised DALY rates declined during the same period. From 2005 to 2013, the number of DALYs increased for most specific non-communicable diseases, including cardiovascular diseases and neoplasms, in addition to dengue, food-borne trematodes, and leishmaniasis; DALYs decreased for nearly all other causes. By 2013, the five leading causes of DALYs were ischaemic heart disease, lower respiratory infections, cerebrovascular disease, low back and neck pain, and road injuries. Sociodemographic status explained more than 50% of the variance between countries and over time for diarrhoea, lower respiratory infections, and other common infectious diseases; maternal disorders; neonatal disorders; nutritional deficiencies; other communicable, maternal, neonatal, and nutritional diseases; musculoskeletal disorders; and other non-communicable diseases. However, sociodemographic status explained less than 10% of the variance in DALY rates for cardiovascular diseases; chronic respiratory diseases; cirrhosis; diabetes, urogenital, blood, and endocrine diseases; unintentional injuries; and self-harm and interpersonal violence. Predictably, increased sociodemographic status was associated with a shift in burden from YLLs to YLDs, driven by declines in YLLs and increases in YLDs from musculoskeletal disorders, neurological disorders, and mental and substance use disorders. In most country-specific estimates, the increase in life expectancy was greater than that in HALE. Leading causes of DALYs are highly variable across countries. Interpretation Global health is improving. Population growth and ageing have driven up numbers of DALYs, but crude rates have remained relatively constant, showing that progress in health does not mean fewer demands on health systems. The notion of an epidemiological transition-in which increasing sociodemographic status brings structured change in disease burden-is useful, but there is tremendous variation in burden of disease that is not associated with sociodemographic status. This further underscores the need for country-specific assessments of DALYs and HALE to appropriately inform health policy decisions and attendant actions.",Article,"Murray, C.J.L.; Barber, R.M.; Foreman, K.J.;

The L-moments methodology was applied for the regionalization. Five stages were considered to apply the methodology: data analysis; the L-Moments estimation; identification of homogeneous regions; fit of probability density functions (pdf) to observed data and estimation of quantile values; and finally, the developing and drawing of regionalized maps. Overall, fifteen homogeneous regions were identified and selected for the regionalization of AMT, which meet specific criteria of homogeneity and discordance. Several pdf for regional frequency analysis were tested in order to select the best probability function. Finally, regionalized temperature maps were generated for several return periods. Using the L-Moments methodology, the regionalization procedure was done using the average of AMT as the key scale parameter. The regionalization procedure ensures, as far as possible, a coherent-basin approach: the boundaries between homogeneous regions were drawn, complying with the catchment borders.",Article,"Unknown.; Giraldo-Osorio, Juan Diego",Annual maximum temperature;L-moments methodology;Regional frequency analysis;Regionalization,Annual maximum temperature;L-moments methodology;Regional frequency analysis;Regionalization,Colombia;Colombia;Colombia;Colombia;Spain,

From the analysis, four homogeneous geographical regions were identified. All regions displayed a water deficit for all the analysed return periods. Results suggest the level of runoff will decrease progressively until the runoff reaches critical conditions of extreme draught along the Bogotá river basin.

,,,5,WOS:000541756700001,2019,A simheuristic for bi-objective stochastic permutation flow shop scheduling problem,"This paper addresses the stochastic permutation flow shop problem (SPFSP) in which the stochastic parameters are the processing times. This allows the modeling of setups and machine breakdowns. Likewise, it is proposed a multi-objective greedy randomized adaptive search procedure (GRASP) coupled with Monte-Carlo Simulation to obtain expected makespan and expected tardiness. To manage the bi-objective function, a sequential combined method is considered in the construction phase of the meta-heuristic. Moreover, the local Search combines 2-optimal interchanges with a Pareto Archived Evolution Strategy (PAES) to obtain the Pareto front. Also, some Taillard benchmark instances of deterministic permutation flow shop problem were adapted in order to include the variation in processing times. Accordingly, two coefficients of variation (CVs) were tested: one depending on expected processing times values defined as twice the expected processing time of a job, and a fixed value of 0.25. Thus, the computational results on benchmark instances show that the variable CV provided lower values of the expected makespan and tardiness, while the constant CV presented higher expected measures. The computational results present insights for further analysis on the behavior of stochastic scheduling problems for a better approach in real-life scenarios at industrial and service systems.

We worked in conjunction with the Hospital Universitario San Ignacio (HUSI) with the goal of designing an application to support decision-making during the bed assignment process. We introduced a mathematical model for the PBA. We used Analytic Hierarchy Process (AHP) to determine the weights attributed to each part of the objective function. Due to the long execution time required, we used a Greedy Algorithm and Tabu Search (TS) to optimize the match between the patient's requirements and the characteristics of the assigned bed. To test the algorithms, we created 15 test instances of various sizes. The results showed that the gap between the value of the objective function resulting from using the Greedy/TS in comparison with the optimal solution is on average 6.2%. Also, the TS takes 84% less time than the MILP for medium and large instances. We collected data from real life instances and compared the actual method with the designed metaheuristic. On average, the value of the objective function resulting from using the proposed Greedy/Tabu algorithm is 8.6% higher.
