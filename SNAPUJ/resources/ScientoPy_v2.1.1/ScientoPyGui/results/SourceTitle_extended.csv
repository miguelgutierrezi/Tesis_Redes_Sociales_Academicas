Its principal etiologic agent is still Streptococcus pneumoniae, followed by Haemophilus influenzae and Staphylococcus aureus. Several risk factors have been described for CAP and specific pathoghens, such as coomorbidities and exposition factors. Diagnosis is made by clinical findings associated to laboratory workup and radiological evidence. CURB-65 and PSI are the most known and used tools that, in association with clinical evaluation, calculate the mortality risk and evaluate the setting of management. This literature review aims to consider crucial aspects for the correct assessment of CAP patients, biomarkers used in CAP, particular situations such as severe CAP as well as prevention strategies.",Review,"Martinez-Vernaza, S.; McKinley, E.; Soto, M.J.; Gualtero, S.",pneumonia; bacterial pneumonia; biomarkers; severity of illness index; risk factors; treatment,pneumonia;bacterial pneumonia;biomarkers;severity of illness index;risk factors;treatment;GUIDELINES;DISEASES;SOCIETY;RISK,Colombia,
,,,3,WOS:000457094900005,2018,Frecuency of Do-Not-Resuscitate Orders in a Level 4 University Hospital,"After the introduction of the cardiopulmonary resuscitation into clinical practice, non-resuscitation orders emerged as an alternative for those patients that, for several reasons, were not candidates to receive this type of medical treatment. Over time, the non-resuscitation orders have increased in number, possibly due to the aging of the population, an increase in the prevalence of oncological pathologies or greater awareness of the physicians regarding the outcomes of the patients being carried to a CPR. According to the above, this study was developed with the objective of knowing and describing the frequency of DNR and CPR in patients who died in a level 4 hospital in the city of Bogota. Likewise, the demographic characteristics of these patients were described.",Article,"Rueda, F.E.G.; Hoyos, A.S.; Echeverri, M.D.; Balocco, A.L.; Parra, A.M.",bioethics; cardiopulmonary resuscitation; resuscitation orders,bioethics;cardiopulmonary resuscitation;resuscitation orders;CARDIOPULMONARY-RESUSCITATION;DECISIONS,Colombia,
,,,2,WOS:000457095800004,2018,Comparison of Plasma Cytokine Levels before and after Treatment with Rituximab in Patients with Rheumatoid Arthritis and Systemic Lupus Erythematosus-Associated Polyautoimmunity,"Introduction: Coexistence of more than one autoimmune disease (AD) in a single patient is known as polyautoimmunity, and may be seen in up to 35% of patients with ADs. The elimination of B-cells using Rituximab (RTX) improves clinical status in different ADs. The role of cytokine production by B-cells is unclear in systemic lupus erythematosus (SLE) and polyautoimmunity. Methods: As an exploratory study, plasma from 11 patients with either rheumatoid arthritis (RA) or SLE-associated polyautoimmunity was assessed prior and 6 months after therapy with RTX. Eight healthy individuals were used as controls. Cytokine levels were measured using ELISA (IFN-alpha and TGF-beta 1) or Cytometric Bead Array (TNF-alpha, IL-1 beta, IL-6, IL-8, IL-10, and IL-12p70). Results: Prior to RTX, IL-6 was only elevated in RA and IL-8 was elevated in both RA and SLE-associated polyautoimmunity, compared with controls. After RTX, significant decreases of IL-6 in RA and IL-8 in SLE-associated polyautoimmunity were observed. Levels of other cytokines measured were either similar (IFN-alpha, TGF-beta 1) or below the detection limit (TNF-alpha, IL-1 beta, IL-10, IL-12p70) for both patients and controls. Conclusion: Our data highlight the importance of B-cell cytokine secretion in RA and SLE-associated polyautoimmunity, and suggest a differential role in each pathology. A significant increase of IL-8 prior to RTX in both groups, and a significant decrease after therapy only in SLE-associated polyautoimmunity support the potential of IL-8 as a therapeutic target. The heterogeneity of the polyautoimmunity patient population highlights the importance of the selection of specific subsets in future research.",Article,"Correa, J.E.B.; Cortes, M.A.F.; Uribe, J.A.; Camacho, L.S.R.",cytokines; interleukin-8; rheumatoid arthritis; systemic lupus erythematosus; rituximab,cytokines;interleukin-8;rheumatoid arthritis;systemic lupus erythematosus;rituximab;CELL DEPLETION THERAPY;TUMOR-NECROSIS-FACTOR;REGULATORY B-CELLS;DOUBLE-BLIND;SJOGRENS-SYNDROME;PROINFLAMMATORY CYTOKINES;INADEQUATE RESPONSE;SERUM-LEVELS;PHASE-III;EFFICACY,Colombia,

Commercially, second-generation complete immunoglobulins and third-generation fabotherapies can be found; however, their differences are unknown to many physicians. Objective: To present the main pharmacokinetic characteristics by comparing the different generations of antivenoms, as well as the frequency of side effects. Materials and Methods: A literature search was conducted in databases using a combination of descriptors and Mesh terms, in English and Spanish. Pharmacokinetic parameters were compared in preclinical studies and side effects in clinical studies. Results: From the researchers analyzed, we found that the main pharmacokinetic differences are a consequence of the size of the immunoglobulin fraction, so the fabotherapic have a greater distribution to the tissues and a shorter half-life, compared with the complete immunoglobulins. At a clinical level, studies were found that showed higher to lower presentation of side effects to complete immunoglobulins, followed by antivenoms F(ab')2 and Fab respectively.

Strategies aimed to reduce their impact are supported by surveillance systems. In Colombia, since 2010 the report of congenital anomalies was included in the surveillance system (Sivigila). Aim: To characterize epidemiologically the notification of the event from its inclusion. Materials and methods: Is carried out descriptive analysis of the events reported during January of 2010 to December of 2013. Results: We found a prevalence of congenital malformations of 0.35% in Colombia during the analyzed period. The congenital anomalies with more frequent notification were those of the central nervous system and the anomalies of limbs. Conclusions: The prevalence reported for congenital malformations in Colombia is low compared to that reported in the literature that is between 3.0-7.0% of the population. The low rate of notification for congenital anomalies evidence the need for training to improve the notification of this event, to have a record closer to the reality of the population and thus be able to take decisions for the benefit of the population and in the generation of knowledge on this topic.",Article,"Acero, M.G.; Plata, S.",congenital anomalies; congenital malformations; notification; epidemiological surveillance,congenital anomalies;congenital malformations;notification;epidemiological surveillance;MALFORMATIONS,Colombia,

The evidence indicates that moderate to severe hypoxic-ischemic encephalopathy must be managed with therapeutic hypothermia. Objectives: Describe the clinical characteristics of a group of neonates treated by the therapeutic hypothermia team of the Neonatal Intensive Care Unit of the Hospital Universitario San Ignacio. Methodology: Sequential cross-section observational study, from June 2015 to March 2017. Continuous variables were compared using student's t-test. Relative frequency analysis was performed and compared according to variants of clinical interest using chi-square. Results: A total of 41 patients were treated by the program during the observation period. Clinical seizures were evident in 65% of the subjects. The main clinical outcome to discharge observed in the patients after the intervention was encephalopathy (90%). The clinical determinants of the birth of the neonate are compared with the death outcome where no significant differences were found proportionally between the two groups except for Apgar at 10 minutes and the presence of acidemia. For the outcome of death, RP greater than 1 in the case of Cesarean section, increased clotting time, thrombocytopenia, hypocalcemia and impaired renal function (p <0.05 and IC-95> 1). Conclusions: Low Apgar at 10 minutes and acidemia is associated with higher mortality. There was a greater prevalence of electrolyte and renal coagulation alterations in the group with lethal outcome.

In this review we present the basic concepts of NGS technologies, the considerations for its current use and future perspectives. Development: NGS-based tests has revolutionized the study of the genomes as it allows the read of millions of DNA sequences massively and parallelly, in a shorter span of time and at a lesser cost per base. These tests include gene panel sequencing, whole exome sequencing and whole genome sequencing. Result analysis can be complex and requires an exhaustive clinical and bioinformatic process for an adequate interpretation. Among the limitations of NGS testing are the errors in technical aspects such as coverage, depth and read length, as well as its limited usefulness for the detection of structural alterations. These limitations can be approached implementing good laboratory practices. Conclusions: NGS tests are diagnostic tools that must be supported by an adequate clinical approach for its reasoned use, correct interpretation and appropriate decision-making. It is of great importance that physicians acquire the basic information to be able to order and interpret these tests given their current relevance.",Article,"Rubio, S.; Pacheco-Orozco, R.A.; Gomez, A.M.; Perdomo, S.; Garcia-Robles, R.",high-throughput nucleotide sequencing; sequence analysis; DNA; mutation; variant interpretation,high-throughput nucleotide sequencing;sequence analysis;DNA;mutation;variant interpretation;MEDICAL GENETICS;DIAGNOSIS;SPECTRUM;GENOMICS;ERA,Colombia,

Objective: To create a virtual clinical simulation guide for nursing students to have autonomous learning of a clinical-care procedure, through the application of an instructional design model. Methods: To develop the guide it was necessary to apply the ADDIE (acronym for Analysis, Design, Development, Implementation and Evaluation) instructional design model, on which some qualitative and quantitative measurements were made. Results: Quantitative measurements made in 159 participants between 2015 and 2016 indicated an average score of 3.99 with a standard deviation of 0.86, which showed that the strategy used to teach the procedure with the virtual guide was effective. The qualitative evaluation assessed dimensions of satisfaction, realistic experience, confidence, motivation, technical skills and decision making, and it showed that teacher support was still required in the simulation area, which reduced the satisfaction of some participants. Likewise, one factor that was affected was communication, because the guide does not facilitate the development of this skill.

Aim: To define the best option between sulfonylureas, thiazolidinediones, DPP4 inhibitors, GLP-1 agonist or basal insulin, as second or third line treatment, in patients with DMT2 who have not reached therapeutic golds with metformin or combined therapy. Methods: A clinical practice guide has been developed following the broad outline of the methodological guide from the Colombian Ministry of Health and Social Welfare, with the aim of systematically gathering scientific evidence and formulating recommendations using the GRADE (Grading of Recommendations Assessment, Development and Evaluation) methodology. Conclusions: In patients with DMT2 who did not reach their therapeutic goal with metformin as a monotherapy (Hb1Ac <7%), addition of a second oral antidiabetic medication is recommended. it is recommended as a first step to add a DPP-4 inhibitor. It is suggested to add a SGLT2 inhibitor or a sulfonylurea having low risk of hypoglycemia as acceptable options. It is suggested to add basal insulin as a third antidiabetic medication if the combination of two pharmacological treatments does not enable the patient to reach and maintain the HbA1c goal. It is suggested to add a GLP-1 agonist if therapeutic failure appears in patients who remain obese (BMI >= 30 kg/m(2)), considering its potential to reduce weight.",Article,"Aschner, P.; Munoz, O.M.; Giron, D.; Garcia, O.M.; Fernandez, D.G.; Casas, L.A.; Bohorquez, L.F.; Arango, C.M.; Carvajal, L.; Ramirez, D.A.; Sarmiento, J.G.; Colon, C.A.; Correa, N.F.; Alarcon, P.; Bustamante, A.A.",type 2 diabetes mellitus; metformin; treatment failure; clinical practice guidelines,type 2 diabetes mellitus;metformin;treatment failure;clinical practice guidelines;METAANALYSIS;INHIBITORS;MANAGEMENT;EVENTS,Colombia,

Methods: A decision-tree model was built based on a hypothetical cohort of 1,000 patients undergoing treatment for UA. Health outcomes and cost analysis were modeled over the projected lifetime. All treatment outcome probabilities and likelihood ratios were obtained from major natural history and outcome studies. Costs were assessed from the societal perspective of the general healthcare system in Colombia. A univariate sensitivity analysis was conducted to evaluate the impact and significance of the results. Results: Significant differences were shown in treatment cost and total effectiveness. SC had a mean treatment cost of US$2,322 and a cost-effectiveness ratio of US $2,735 (EC: US$4,650 and US$5,798). A univariate sensitivity analysis showed that the total cost-effectiveness of SC remained dominantly superior to EC. Conclusions: From an economic standpoint, results show that SC is the most cost-effective treatment alternative in a middle-income country.

Since then they have become a device broadly used worldwide with an important commercial activity. Unfortunately, they have an equivalent or even greater risk for multiple harmful health outcomes when compared with conventional cigarettes. Nevertheless, these devices are perceived less harmful or addictive, and are more socially accepted. Additionally, most users belong to the teenage population, which is characterized by greater vulnerability due to the ongoing neurodevelopment process. Objective: Conduct a thematic review of the electronic cigarettes, their regulatory policies, consumption patterns and described associations with mental health. Methodology: A search for secondary studies was conducted in PubMed and SciELO databases using MeSH, DeCS and free terms. Review results were performed according to the aimed topics for evaluation. Finally, 54 articles were obtained after the screening process. Discussion: The influence of nicotine on adolescent brain development is well described, just as their consumption trend and the regulatory measures that have been implemented. The high risk for mental health in adolescents that represent electronic cigarettes, added to poor regulations in our country, generates the need to strengthen prevention and intervention systems for nicotine consumption, as well as stringent commercial policies against its sale modalities.",Review,"Botero-Rodriguez, F.; Rivera, A.M.; Leal, A.; Mendez, C.C.; Gomez-Restrepo, C.",electronic nicotine delivery systems; electronic cigarette; adolescent; public health; mental health,electronic nicotine delivery systems;electronic cigarette;adolescent;public health;mental health;E-CIGARETTES;HEALTH;SMOKING;ADULTS;EXPOSURE;TRENDS;POLICY;RISK,Colombia,

What Clinicians Ignore,"To narrow the gap between the bench and the clinic, healthcare personnel should have a basic understanding of molecular mechanisms ruling cell identity, since it establishes the key differences between health and disease states. Differential gene expression allows for protein synthesis required for the cell's biological function. In this process genes are selected from the entire genome to meet the cell's biological functioning and respond to internal and external stimuli. To this end, first the chromatin must be remodeled for the transcriptional machinery to gain access to DNA sequences coding for particular genes. DNA can then be transcribed into mRNA, followed by different processes leading to mature mRNA leaving the nucleus for protein synthesis in the cytoplasm. Any dysregulation in these processes results in disease. In the beginning of this millennium the human genome project sequenced the whole genome. Surprisingly, one of the main findings was only 2% of the genome represented protein coding sequences, which raised the question about the remainder of the genome and cell identity.

In this syndrome, the expression of the Fragile X Mental Retardation Protein (FMRP), an RNA-binding protein that functions as a negative regulator of translation, is affected. FMRP participates in the synaptic refinement of neuronal circuits during development. Failures in its function coincide with the appearance of neuronal circuits overabundant in immature dendritic spines and with loss of synaptic plasticity. On the other hand, Neuroligins (Nlgs), which have been found to be mutated in some patients with ASDs, are postsynaptic neuronal adhesion proteins. These proteins help in the dendritic specialization and maturation, and their mutation coincides with alterations in synaptic transmission. Since FMRP and Nlgs are proteins necessary for the processes of synaptic elimination and maturation, both affected in FXS and ASDs, in this review we collect and examine the evidence of the main findings on these proteins, their relationship and their modulation dependent on the electrical activity generated by sensory experience.

In-person lectures and seminars were migrated online using telepresence tools; whilst hand-on professional training and supervised practice were staged and performed in reduced groups to comply with person-to-person distancing policies to contain the spread of the virus. This was particularly challenging as the program makes emphasis on constructivist learning and social engagement. After six months, the effects of changes in lecturing were assessed through a poll which showed that there was widespread acceptance within the whole academic community. Particularly it was observed that use of remote presence tools enhanced engagement, improved knowledge appropriation and allowed for more flexibility. Therefore, there is support for making the implemented actions permanent.

Beliefs around this religion have crossed borders due to the voluntary or forced migration of their community, exercising a major socio-cultural influence on its believers regarding death and, therefore, human organ donation and tissues for transplantation. For this reason, its study is an issue of great interest to health professionals, since there are perceptions that have a direct impact on the conception of their faithful. The body is considered as a sacred entity, symbol of the integration of the soul, matter, ego and intellect with a resurrection that could jeopardize its integrity when donation is carried out.

Methods: An exploratory study with interpretative phenomenological analysis was carried out. We used focus group with pre-established domains. Independent manual coding was performed and the codes subsequently grouped for interpretation. The grouping was triangulated with the research team to generate definitive categories. Results: Two categories emerged: conceptualization and life-experience with CAM. Each category includes similar (i.e. denominations, use of CAM) and differential sub-categories (i.e. value judgment, scientific rationale), between the two groups. The conceptualization recognizes how participants characterize the CAMs and the life-experience identifies the way they relate to the CAMs. Conclusions: Patients and professionals share concerns regarding the use of CAM, but there are differences in language and expectations concerning its use.

The data was divided into ""training"" and ""testing"". A bivariate logistic regression between triage and mortality using ""training"" data was done. Afterwards, a multivariate logistic regression was downgraded using the previous information. In order to find the set point, an Area Under the Curve (ROC) was calculated using the ""testing data"". The efficiency was evaluated using measures of association. Three different ROC models were created: ""triage"" which showed an ROC-0.82, ""reduced"" with an ROC-0.90 and ""age+systolic"" with an ROC-0.87, thereby not exhibiting significant difference. The reduced model was chosen, presenting sensitivity of 0.869, specificity of 0.842, PPV 0.062, and NPV 0.998.

Its diagnosis and management have been controversial, given the absence of clinical practice guidelines that allow a standardized approach. Objective: The purpose of this article is to suggest a diagnostic and therapeutic algorithm based on the review of non-systematic literature on physiopathology, etiology, risk factors, diagnosis and treatment of prostate abscesses. Materials and methods: We reviewed Medline with MeSH terms: ""prostate"", ""abscess"", and free terms: ""prostatic abscess"", obtaining 71 review articles. From these, we selected the 19 articles written in English that best correlated with the search topic. We did a critical review of these, to finally suggest a diagnostic and therapeutic algorithm. Results: Of the 19 selected articles, we found only 1 randomised clinical trial, 7 observational retrospective cohort studies, 3 non-systematic review articles, 6 case reports, 2 case series and no clinical practice guidelines. Conclusions: Standardized clinical practice guidelines for the management of prostate abscesses do not yet exist. The diagnostic method of choice is transrectal ultrasonography (USTR) of the prostate. Treatment depends on the size and location of the abscess. For abscesses < 1 cm or < 0.5 cm(3) cc, conservative treatment is suggested.

The RR movement proposes that primary data and computer codes used in the research must be publically available to let other researchers verify published results and to conduct alternative analysis. The advantages related to RR apply well to the qualitative researcher's work, and will increase the confidence and approval of their results, and additionally could provide advantages like the deeper understanding of their findings, the chance to create investigation networks and groups for collaborative knowledge building. The biggest limitations to produce qualitative reproducible research are ethical considerations associated with making sensitive information openly available. The present article presents some proposals to overcome these difficulties associated with the process of obtaining informed consent and measures to guarantee the confidentiality of data, recognizing that there is much work to be done in this area.

Materials and Methods: Sensory and motor nerve conduction studies were performed on 77 healthy volunteers between 18 and 65 years old, for a total of 154 analyzes, using a standardized technique for measurement. Results: Motor nerve conductions were performed measuring latency, amplitude and conduction velocity for the median, ulnar, tibial, and peroneal nerve. Sensory nerve conductions were performed measuring latency and conduction velocity for the median, ulnar, and sural nerve. A Shapiro-Wilk test was performed, finding that the amplitude parameters for sensory nerve conductions did not follow a normal distribution, so percentile analysis was performed. Only sex showed a statistically significant difference for the parameters of tibial nerve amplitude (p = 0.0099) being greater in women, and latency of the peroneal nerve (p = 0.0091) being greater in men.

It may be accompanied by some alterations in biochemical signals with subsequent manifestations of anxiety, imbalance in patterns of appetite and satiety, persistence of alcoholism. Objective: To propose an explanatory hypothesis on the influence of OAS as a factor or influential element on the origin and persistence of abusive alcohol consumption. Methodology: Systematic revision of medical literature published in English and Spanish in biomedical databases, related to the biochemical consequences of OSA in the levels of cortisol, ghrelin and leptin. Discussion: Information is found about the alterations of cortisol, ghrelin and leptin because of OSA, which allows to think in a relationship between apnea as a risk factor for alcohol consumption. Conclusions:Sleep disorders generate alterations in the cycle of cortisol, leading to an increase of its levels. Chronic reduction of sleep increases the activity of the sympathetic nervous system which translates into anxiety. Persons with moderate and severe OAS have higher appetite during night due to the increase of cortisol levels at that time of the day. Ghrelin is increased in persons with OSA, which translates into an increase in appetite and ingestion avidity.

In Colombia, there are few reports on the epidemiology of brain tumors, and those that exist are from local databases that don ' t have a rigorous and massive registry. Aim: To determine the survival rates of brain tumors in Colombia. Methods: A retrospective descriptive observational study was conducted, using databases of population-based cancer registries in Colombia. We extracted information from 2003-2012 of patients with tumors without age group restriction. The survival rates were calculated, using the Kaplan-Meier method and the statistical software Stata 14.0. Results: From 2003-2012, 775 adult patients and 123 pediatric patients were reported with a new central nervous system tumor diagnosis in the four cities. The most frequent tumors in the pediatric age group were neuroepithelial tumors, embryonal tumors and ependymal tumors; whereas for adults, the most frequent were neuroepithelial tumors, meningiomas and hematolymphoid tumors. The global survival rate at 6 months, 1 year, 2 years and 3 years, were approximately 49.9%, 35.2%, 21.4% and 15.3% in the pediatric population, and 70.2%, 58.9%, 43.3% and 35.4% in the adult population. Conclusions: The present work constitutes the most recent and multicentric study on the epidemiology of brain tumors in Colombia.

Literature review,"Pathologies of tumor origin are more frequent in the older adult population, however said population has fewer opportunities to access diagnostic studies and therapeutic interventions, not only due to the age and stage of the cancer, but also because they have conditions of aging such as decreased functional reserve, multiple pathologies, cognitive disorders, or lack of social support that impact on the clinical response to the different therapies that exist to treat cancer. In addition to this, the risk of toxicity conferred by the various cancer treatments, which leads to a more careful evaluation of the type of therapy, the dose, and the benefit of starting it. With the discovery of new therapies for cancer management, we not only face the risk of toxicity with traditional chemotherapy, but also the schemes developed in recent times, such as immunotherapy or targeted therapy, which can mainly generate toxicity to a lesser degree. cardiovascular, gastrointestinal and skin hematological. Taking into account the above, an attempt has been made to advance in the prediction of the risk of toxicity to chemo-radiotherapy, counting to date with different models based on clinical and paraclinical calculations, many of these criteria that come out of these tools are derived from the assessment geriatric (GV), we find tools to evaluate functional performance, cognitive status, social support, which provides valuable and comprehensive information for decision-making not only therapeutic, as well as models that include clinical and paraclinical parameters such as the CRASH tool which predicts non-hematological and joint hematological toxicity and the CARG tool that predicts joint toxicity. However, globally, these toxicity risk prediction tools have several limitations, such as the lack of precision when calculating the risk of severe toxicity associated with chemo-radiotherapy, many are not validated, so many studies conclude that models are needed more accurate when predicting such risk.

For this purpose, the author uses an analysis of scholarly productivity with data of 513 professors in the field of psychology in North America, between 1997 and 1998. Based on this analysis it is possible to identify three latent variables that describe the productivity of the sample: one factor that captures the inflation of all the observed variables, one factor that measures individual productivity and a factor that measures the joint productivity of faculty members. The findings suggest the need of novel approaches to policies for measurement and support of faculty productivity.

Internal consistency and factor analysis were conducted to test the reliability and construct validity of the instrument. Self-reported intention to execute risky behavior was compared with observed behaviors. The developed questionnaire showed high internal consistency for most of the TPB constructs (Chronbach's alpha>0.7). Factor analyses confirmed that questions grouped in constructs, as hypothesized. Pedestrians' intention to execute risky behavior was related to pedestrians' perceived physical capability and to the simultaneous crossing of other pedestrians.

Feelings associated to displacement were fear, embarrassment, sadness, uncertainty lack of trust, homesickness and suffering. The accompaniment allowed the transit from suffering to hope and from lack of trust to trust. Feelings associated to the traumatized memory (Lira, 1990) couldn't be reframed. The main factors for the permanence of these feelings are the continuity of the armed conflict and the scarcity of structural conditions for a dignified re-restoration.

The relationship between the current medical education process and the attitudes regarding HRE in the sample are analyzed. A small trend towards progress in all categories and in all components of attitudes throughout medical education is described; neither the Benefit nor the Subject-End/means/Dignity categories evolve in a significant way; some significant differences were observed in the Justice category ( beliefs and behavioral) and in the Subject-End/means-Dignity category ( beliefs component).

Cognitive change is characterized in terms of the forms of variable control, the different states and emergent transitions between the attempts, and the generated paths and trajectories. The problems were presented using the Uranus web application (version 2) and the data was modeled and analyzed under the finite automata technique using the Auros system (version 1). Two case studies were conducted with two schoolgirls regarding cognitive changes, with a microgenetic methodological approach, which assumes that the subject's behavior is not linear and that it shows specific ascents, descents, and equilibria, in the context of a probabilistic epigenesis. The results confirm that the novelty arises in a space of related tensions, non-sequential, as a systemic scenario of opposing forces that do not obey the passage between the simple and the complex; the emergence of change is imposed at some point, when a force of a conquered state determines the following in a certain direction, in a non-ergodic development process, which shows variation and difference, inter and intra subject. The study has its limitations in respect to the sample selected as well as the calculated likelihoods of following or not following a specific route, a theme that should be dealt in the next research.",Article,"Escobar-Melo, Hugo.; Correa, Rocio Abello.; Unknown.; Bustacara-Medina, Cesar",Cognitive change;Emerge;Finite automata;Problem solving;Self-organization,Cognitive change;Emerge;Finite automata;Problem solving;Self-organization,Colombia,

Though instruments used to assess social behavior are thought to be sensitive, the absence of structural damage in TBI patients may lead to underscore such problems. The aim of this study was to develop a complementary diagnostic tool such as a paradigm for functional Magnetic resonance Imaging (fMRI) involving a simple task that could tell how patients understand certain complex social behavior by identifying different movements with or without social intentions where language and complex cognitive process were not required. Eleven patients with mild TBI and social cognition difficulties and twelve control subjects were matched by demographic variables. A paradigm of social fMRI was developed by using dots in movement representing human motion, human motion with social intention such as dancing or sharing, and dots moving without meaning. Patients had less activation in parietotemporal junction and bilateral middle frontal gyrus in the social perception task movement compared with control group subjects. The fMRI paradigm developed can be an additional diagnostic tool for identifying social cognition impairments in mild TBI patients. Regardless the absence of structural injury, changes in activation areas suggest a prospective use of this tool since clinical, cognitive and functional outcomes support such finding.",Article,"Reyes, P.; Matallana, D.; Santiago, G.; Filizzola, C.; Morillo, A.; Velasco, S.; Bermudez, S.",social cognition; functional Magnetic Resonance Image; Traumatic Brain Injury,social cognition;functional Magnetic Resonance Image;Traumatic Brain Injury;MOTOR,Colombia,2-s2.0-85019738819

Experimental group participants completed brief values consistency and perspective taking tasks whereas the control group completed a guided task. A 2 x 4 mixed repeated measures analysis of variance ANOVA was conducted to determine whether there was any interaction effect between the group and trial types and a MANOVA to identify differences in the explicit measures between both groups. Results show that after the values work and perspective taking exercises, participants in the experimental group recorded shorter mean responses for Inconsistent-Black trial blocks versus Consistent-Black trial blocks as compared to the control group.

Transference has its origins in the effort of an unsatisfied libidinal investiture that continues to be active in the Unconscious, and which allows the primary process to inadvertently filter into the secondary process through a ""false link"". Therefore, a current perception becomes identified with the expectative representation, which makes the individual believe that this new person will satisfy the aforementioned investiture.

Despite the existence of teleconsultation services in Colombia, few studies about it have been published. As a result of the health crisis caused by the COVID-19 pandemic, the Telepsychology care service was implemented in a university psychological care center. The goal of this study is to characterize the care experiences of the Telepsychology modality from the point of view of the consultants and students in their clinical practice. This with the purpose of enhancing the knowledge in this area and contributing to the evaluation of the viability of these services. A descriptive characterization study was carried out, with a cross-sectional design. The research team elaborated a questionnaire, that was answered by 253 consultants and 77 students. The information obtained evidenced that Telepsychology care achieved high levels of satisfaction with the treatment received, the possibility of establishing a therapeutic bond and the development of clinical skills in students.

The Instituto de Genetica Humana of the Pontificia Universidad Javeriana conducted an epidemiological surveillance of congenital malformations as defined by criteria provided by the Latin American Collaborative Study of Congenital Malformations. Objective. The frequency of the main congenital malformations were tabulated for major urban centers in Colombia. Materials and methods. Information was gathered from 52,744 newborns between April 2001 and January 2008 in three cities of Colombia (Bogota, Ubate and Manizales). Data included the age of mother, gestational age, gender and weight of the newborn and the congenital malformation. Cases were classified according to a prognostic scale to assess the impact of health team interventions in the recovery process. Results. Congenital defects were noted in 3.1% of the newborns. The most frequent congenital defects were those of the ears. Clubfoot, polydactyly and cleft lip or palate were more common amongst males. The weight and gestational age were lower in the congenitally affected in comparison with the control group. The prognostic scale of congenital malformations indicated that most of these patients are at high risk of death or disability and that the intervention of the health team changed the patient's prognosis in approximately 80% of the cases. Conclusion. Frequencies of congenital malformations in Colombia were similar to those reported in other countries. The interventions of the health team in treating patients with congenital malformations directly affected patient prognosis. Therefore, early diagnosis and adequate interdisciplinary treatment were recommended by these data in order to reduce disability and improve the quality of life of these patients.",Article,"Zarante, I.; Franco, L.; Lopez, C.; Fernandez, N.",congenital abnormalities/epidemiology; prognosis; infant mortality; disabled children; International Classification of Functioning; Disability and Health,congenital abnormalities/epidemiology;prognosis;infant mortality;disabled children;International Classification of Functioning;Disability and Health;DOWN-SYNDROME;SIRENOMELIA;DISEASE,Colombia,2-s2.0-77954368569

Mucopolysaccharidoses are a group of infrequent disorders caused by the lysosomal deposit of glycosaminoglycans. Its incidence is quite variable among the countries where it has been documented. In Brazil, disorder frequencies have been reported, but in Colombia information on them is scarce. Objectives. The frequency and spatial aggregations of the mucopolysaccharidoses were estimated by a retrospective study in two central Colombian provinces. Materials and methods. The records of patients and live newborns between 1998-2007 were reviewed from several reference institutions for genetic diseases. From these records, the frequencies for each mucopolysaccharidosis were estimated. The spatial aggregation of the cases was analyzed using the SaTScan software. Results. The combined frequency for all the mucopolysaccharidoses was 1.98 cases per 100,000 live newborns. MPS IV had the highest frequency with 0.68 cases per 100,000 live newborns and MPS III showed a lower frequency of 0.17/100,000. Three spatial aggregation areas were indicated for MPS I, MPS III and MPS IV. Conclusion. The combined frequency for all the mucopolysaccharidoses has been reported, with type IV the most frequent and the type VII in second place.

Obesity is frequently associated with risk factors for cardiovascular and metabolic diseases. Central obesity is a marker of increased intra-abdominal adiposity and a known risk factor for atherosclerosis and diabetes; it is also a good predictor of risk for coronary events, cardiovascular mortality, diabetes and metabolic syndrome. A less predictive alternate measurement is known as the body mass index (BMI). Objective. Obesity prevalence was estimated first by BMI and then by abdominal obesity (measured by waist circumference, WC) in primary care patients. Materials and methods. As part of an international study, primary care physicians recruited consecutive patients aged 18 to 80 years who consulted for any reason on two pre-specified half-days. Age, gender, smoking status and history of cardiovascular disease or diabetes were recorded. Height, weight and WC were measured using standard methods. Pregnant women and subjects unwilling to participate were excluded. Results. A total of 3,795 patients from 105 primary care centers located throughout Colombia were evaluated. The mean age was 45 years (69% females). Of these, 60.7% of males and 53.9% of females were overweight or obese according to their BMI; 24.6% of males and 44.6% of females had abdominal obesity when National Cholesterol Education Program guidelines were used, but numbers changed to 62.5% and 67.0% when the International Diabetes Federation guidelines were used. Obesity, either determined by BMI or by WC, was associated with higher prevalence of diabetes, hypertension and dyslipidemia. Conclusions.

The main route of Chagas disease transmission is through vectors of the insect family Reduviidae. However, the parasite can also be transmitted from infected mothers to their fetus in utero. Until now, no cases of congenital Chagas disease have been reported in Colombia. Objective. A congenital Chagas disease case occurred in Moniquira County, Boyaca, Colombia. It was confirmed by comparing strains isolated from the mother and her baby using polymerase chain reaction (PCR) with arbitrary primers. Materials and methods. The parasite DNA was extracted from positive blood cultures of the aflicted mother and her son. The species confirmation and group detection were performed by PCR. The strain genotypes were determined by AP-PCR with two oligonucleotides based on the genes for the b-globin (5'-CCTCACCTTCTTTCATGGAG-3') and 16S RrNA (5'ACGGGCAGTGTGTACAAGACC-3'), in differente reactions. Results. The T. cruzi strains isolated from the blood cultures of the mother and her son showed the same amplification profile by the two AP-PCR tests; this corresponded with profiles of the T. cruzi I strains used as controls. However, T. cruzi II was also found in the blood culture from the newborn. Conclusions. This is the first case of Chagas disease transmission reported in Moniquira, demonstrating that this form of transmission occurs in Colombia.

In Colombia, reported cases of acute Chagas disease are sporadic. Objective. Ten cases were described that had been reported to the Parasitology Laboratory of the Colombian National Health Institute between December 2002 and November 2005. Materials and methods. Information from clinical records, epidemiological report forms, laboratory and blood tests was collated. In addition the following data were compiled: demographic variables, clinical findings, results of laboratory tests and other exams (such as peripheral blood smears), IFAT for IgG antibodies, isolation in culture medium, inoculation in mice, polymerase chain reaction tests and isoenzyme eletrophoresis. Results. All the cases presented in known endemic areas for Chagas disease transmission in Colombia. Three cases were from Putumayo Province, two each from the provinces of Arauca, Casanare, Norte de Santander and one from Santander Province. The probable mode of transmission was vector-borne. Seven cases presented in adults aged 18 to 50, three in children aged 6 months to 2 years. Seven were male and three were female. The most frequent symptom was fever in nine cases. Signs of portal of entry were rare; only one patient presented a possible Romaña's sign. Three patients presented myocarditis, two acute cardiac failure and one cardiac tamponade. Parasitemia was evident in nine cases; five had positive IgG serological tests; live cases were confirmed through parasite isolation; isoenzyme electrophoresis showed Trypanosoma cruzi group 1. Conclusions. Clinical variability prevailed. In none of the cases was a clinical diagnosis suspected. The diagnosis was made and confirmed through laboratory tests alone.

Thus, functional status measurement is a marker of social wellbeing. Objective: To determine and characterize the socio-demographic factors and health conditions related to functional impairment in older adults in Bogota, Colombia. Materials and methods: Data was collected from the SABE Bogota Study. Functional status was assessed using the Barthel and Lawton scales. Independent variables included socio-demographic factors, comorbidities, anthropometric measurements and physical activity (by tertiles).

Heart transplant is a therapeutic option in the treatment of chagasic cardiomyopathy. For early detection of Chagas reactivation cases, the use of PCR tests using endomyocardial biopsies has been proposed. Development of an animal model will be the first step in evaluating the applicability of this approach. Objective. PCR tests based on the TcH2AF-R and S35-S36 primers were evaluated for the detection of T. cruzi in heart tissue of mice experimentally infected with the parasite. Materials and methods. Two groups of ICR mice of 15 and 10 individuals were infected by intraperitoneal injection with 0.3 ml of PBS containing 1x10(6) trypomastigotes of the MHOM/CO/2001/D.A. (T. cruzi I) strain or 1x10(4) trypomastigotes of MHOM/BR/00/Y (T. cruzi II) strain. Parasitemia and cardiac parasitic infection were determined at 30, 60 (acute model), 100 and 150 (chronic model) days by means of histopathological examination and by PCR, using the TcH2AF-R and S35-S36 primers. Results. The histopathological findings revealed alterations in the heart and the presence of intracellular amastigotes in acute and chronic models. In contrast to parasitemia levels and histopathological analyses, S35-S36 PCR detected infections in mice that were infected with either parasite strain. TcH2AF-R PCR detected T cruzi I-infected mice earlier and more frequently than inspection for parasitemia or histopathological examination. Conclusions.

Mucopolysaccharidosis IVA (Morquio A) is caused by a deficiency of N-acetylgalactosamine-6-sulphate-sulphatase, a lysosomal enzyme required for the stepwise degradation of keratan-sulfate and chondroitin-6-sulfate. A deficiency in this enzyme results in an accumulation of glycosaminoglycans in several tissues. Currently, no effective therapies exist and only supportive measures are used to treat some manifestations of the disease. An ideal therapy is one that can be administrated early in life, has low mortality, and leads to long-term expression of the enzyme. Gene therapy emerges as a potential alternative to correct the genetic defect in MPS IVA. Objective. Adenoassociated virus-derived expression vectors (AAV) were constructed to correct in vitro the enzyme deficiency in mucopolysaccharidosis IVA. Materials and methods. Adenoasociated virus-derived vectors containing the human GALNS gene and driven by the citomegalivirus immedited-early promoter were constructed using a free-adenoviral protocol. HEK293 cells and human skin Morquio A fibroblasts were transfected with the recombinat vectors. Enzyme activity was measured in cells 24 and 48 hours post-transfection. Results. Free-adenovirus recombinant AAV vectors were obtained with titres up to 2.08x10(10) capsids/mL.

These defects are significant causes of morbidity and mortality in children worldwide. Objective: To determine the prevalence of congenital heart diseases in Bogota, Colombia, through the period 2001 to 2014 and evaluate the trend in time. Materials and methods: We analyzed 405,408 births from the Programa de Vigilancia y Seguimiento de Ninos con Anomalias Congenitas de la Secretaria Distrital de Salud de Bogota. We calculated the prevalence of congenital heart diseases through a daily registry of births, the clinical evaluation, and the work-up. Congenital heart diseases were classified as isolated, complex or associated. We estimated the prevalence per year and the mortality in the first hours of life. Results: The total prevalence of congenital heart diseases was 15.1 per 10,000 newborns; however, we obtained values above 20 per 10,000 newborns in the previous 3 years. Of the newborns analyzed, 46% were females, 53.16% were males, and 0.33% undetermined. Out of the newborns with congenital anomalies, 397 had congenital heart diseases, 142 of which were classified as associated and 74 as complex. Conclusion: Congenital heart diseases have a significant impact on childhood morbidity and mortality. Although the prevalence continues to be low compared to other countries, this could be due to under registry nationwide. There was an increase in prevalence during the previous three years, which might be explained by the implementation of local and national programs. Therefore, we suggest continuing the development and promotion of such programs aimed at increasing screening and registration of these anomalies.",Article,"Tassinari, S.; Martinez-Vernaza, S.; Erazo-Morera, N.; Pinzon-Arciniegas, M.C.; Gracia, G.; Zarante, I.",Heart defects; congenital/epidemiology; congenital abnormalities; prevalence; infant mortality,Heart defects;congenital/epidemiology;congenital abnormalities;prevalence;infant mortality;BIRTH PREVALENCE;DEFECTS;MORTALITY;CHILDREN;CITIES,Colombia,2-s2.0-85034613574

Diagnosis of Chagas disease in its latent and chronic phase is difficult because of the low parasitemia levels. Therefore, serological and molecular techniques are necessary to achieve an appropriate diagnosis. Objective. The polymerase chain reaction based on the amplification of the SIRE element inserted into H2A encoding genes was compared with classical serological tests for the diagnosis of Chagas disease in Colombian patients. Materials and methods. An agreement study was carried out by comparing the PCR with ELISA (enzyme linked immuno sorbent assay) and FAT (indirect immunofluorescence) tests. In addition, the PCR sensitivity and specificity were determined. A sample of 156 individuals was tested with the H2A PCR primers after a Chagas disease classification based on clinical, epidemiological and serological data associated with each patient. In addition, 97 out of 156 samples were also compared with the S35/S36 PCR primers. Results. Eighty-nine of 156 samples (57%) were positive by both FAT and ELISA and 84 (53.8%) presented the expected 234 bp amplification fragment. The sensitivity of the TcH2AF/R PCR was 88% (95% C.I.: 75%--95%) and its specificity 92.5% (95% C.I.: 87.7%--97.2%). The kappa index for concordance between serological tests and TcH2AF/R PCR was 0.8 (95% C.I.: 73%--86%), and between the TcH2AF/R and S35/S36 PCR primers was 0.9 (95% C.I.: 84%-96%).

Hunter syndrome (MC KUSIK 309900) or mucopolysachariclosis type 11 is due to the deficiency of the enzyme iduronate 2 sulfate sulfatase (E.C. 3.1.6.13). This enzyme has not been crystallized, and therefore the experimental structures are not available. Objectives. A computational three-dimensional model was proposed for the iduronate 2 sulfate sulfatase enzyme. Materials and methods. A computational analysis of this enzyme used the following free internet software programs: Comput pl/MW, JaMBW Chapter 3.1.7, SWISS-MODEL, Geno3d, ProSup. Energy minimization was done with Discover 3 and Insight 11 version 2004. Results. A three-dimensional conformational model was proposed. The model showed 33.3% of helix structure, 7.2% beta sheet, and 59.5% random coil. RMS values (Root Mean Square) (0.78 and 0.86 angstrom) were found when compared with other enzymes of the same family. The model presented 5 exposed N-glycosylation potential sites and an entry to the pocket that contains the amino acids of the active site.

Mucopolysaccharidosis IVA (Morquio A) is caused by a deficiency of N-acetylgalactosamine-6-sulphate-sulphatase, a lysosomal enzyme required for the stepwise degradation of keratan-sulfate and chondroitin-6-sulfate. A deficiency in this enzyme results in an accumulation of glycosaminoglycans in several tissues. Currently, no effective therapies exist and only supportive measures are used to treat some manífestations of the disease. An ideal therapy is one that can be administrated early in life, has low mortality, and leads to long-term expression of the enzyme. Gene therapy emerges as a potential alternative to correct the genetic defect in MPS IVA. Objective. Adenoassociated virus-derived expression vectors (AAV) were constructed to correct in vitro the enzyme deficiency in mucopolysaccharidosis IVA. Materials and methods. Adenoasociated virus-derived vectors containing the human GALNS gene and driven by the citomegalivirus immedited-early promoter were constructed using a free-adenoviral protocol. HEK293 cells and human skin Morquio A fibroblasts were transfected with the recombinat vectors. Enzyme activity was measured in cells 24 and 48 hours post-transfection. Results. Free-adenovirus recombinant AAV vectors were obtained with titres up to 2.08×1010 capsids/mL. HEK293 cells and Morquio A fibroblasts transfected with vectors showed GALNS activity up to 3.05 nmoles/mg/h 48 hours post-transfection. Conclusion.

Diagnosis of apenclicitis is difficult; however several clinical scales have been developed that attempt to improve diagnostic accuracy. Objective. The operational characteristics of Alvarado and Fenyo scales were defined in patients with abdominal pain suggestive of appendicitis and were compare with clinical and pathological diagnoses. Material and methods. A prospective trial assessed the diagnostic tests. Sign, symptoms, and laboratory tests were included in scales selected. Surgeon decision was maintained independent from the results of the scales. Sensitivity, specificity, positive and negative predictive value and positive and negative likelihood ratio for each scale was compared with the surgeon evaluation. Results. The sample included 374 patients with approximately equal sexes. Of these 269 patients underwent surgery. Howeve, 16.9% of the male and 31.4% of female patients did not have appendicitis. For men, a diagnosis made by the surgeon had better sensitivity than scales (86.2% vs. 73% for Alvarado and 67.2% for Fenyb) without significant differences in specificity. For women, surgeon and Alvarado scale diagnoses were similar, and better than Feny6 scale (77.1% vs. 79.5% for Alvarado and 47% for Feny6), but specificity was higher for Fenyb scale (92.9% vs. 71.4% for Alvarado and 75.9% for surgeon). Accuracy in diagnosis of appendicitis increases with a higher Alvarado score. Conclusion. For men with abdominal pain on right lower quadrant, surgeon diagnosis is more accurate than scales.

For early detection of Chagas reactivation cases, the use of PCR tests using endomyocardial biopsies has been proposed. Development of an animal model will be the first step in evaluating the applicability of this approach. Objective: PCR tests based on the TcH2AF-R and S35-S36 primers were evaluated for the detection of T. cruzi in heart tissue of mice experimentally infected with the parasite. Materials and methods: Two groups of ICR mice of 15 and 10 individuals were infected by intraperitoneal injection with 0.3 ml of PBS containing 1×106 trypomastigotes of the MHOM/CO/2001/D.A. (T. cruzi I) strain or 1×104 trypomastigotes of MHOM/BR/00/Y (T. cruzi II) strain. Parasitemia and cardiac parasitic infection were determined at 30, 60 (acute model), 100 and 150 (chronic model) days by means of histopathological examination and by PCR, using the TcH2AF-R and S35-S36 primers. Results: The histopathological findings revealed alterations in the heart and the presence of intracellular amastigotes in acute and chronic models. In contrast to parasitemia levels and histopathological analyses, S35-S36 PCR detected infections in mice that were infected with either parasite strain. TcH2AF-R PCR detected T. cruzi I-infected mice earlier and more frequently than inspection for parasitemia or histopathological examination.

Objective: To describe a method for building up a harmonic multicolor panel with 11 flow cytometry parameters for phenotypic and functional analysis on CD8(+) T lymphocytes. Materials and methods: For the multicolor panel construction, we selected the molecules and titred conjugated antibodies with fluorochromes for CD3, CD8, CCR7, CD28, CD27, CD45RA, CD95 and CD127 determination in peripheral blood mononuclear cells (PBMC). To evaluate the panel, the conjugated antibodies were gradually added one by one and fluorescence minus one (FMO) test was performed. This method was applied to assess ex vivo subpopulations of T cells and the production of intracellular IFN gamma, IL-2 and TNF alpha using polyclonal stimulation with enterotoxin B from Staphylococcus aureus (SEB) and antigen-specific cells with crude Trypanosoma cruzi antigen. Finally, the ex vivo CD8(+) T lymphocyte subpopulations frequencies were analyzed in healthy individuals. Results: The evaluation of the selected molecules and conjugates did not show interference in the fluorescence signals and detection. The frequencies of CD8(+) T cells evaluated were similar to the values reported in other studies. Additionally, we observed that the frequency of CD8(+) T lymphocytes producing IFN gamma, IL- 2 and TNF alpha was higher 6 hours after culture with SEB and crude T. cruzi lysate.

Research in laboratories around the world has documented the contribution of the E apolipoprotein alleles to structural variations of lipids and apolipoproteins. Objective. The gene frequencies of the E apolipoprotein alleles were compared with the lipid and apolipoprotein levels in school age children. Materials and methods. Six hundred and ninety one 5 to 15 years old school age children from the Colombian departments of Cundinamarca, Boyacá, Meta, Santander and Norte de Santander, were evaluated.The genotypes of the E apolipoprotein were identified by polymerase chain reaction-restriction fragment length polymorphism. Plasma levels for the following 5 lipids and lipoproteins were assayed: total cholesterol, HDL (high density lipoprotein) cholesterol, LDL (low density lipoprotein) cholesterol, triglycerides, VLDL (very low density lipoprotein) cholesterol, A-I apolipoprotein and B-100 apolipoprotein. Results. Alleles e2, e3 and e4 were found in frequencies of 0.04, 0.86 and 0.08, respectively. The E4 group (E4/3-E4/4), in contrast with the E2 group (E3/2-E2/2), presented highest plasma concentrations of total cholesterol, LDL cholesterol and B-100 apolipoprotein (p=0.014, 0.001 and 0.000, respectively). When the E3/3 group was compared with E2, the same result was obtained (p=0.015, 0.002 and 0.002, respectively). The influence of the E apolipoprotein polymorphism appeared greater in female children than male. Conclusions.

Their concentrations are modified depending on several factors including metabolic status, diabetes mellitus type 2 and cardiovascular diseases. Objective. The leptin concentrations were measured in Colombian children and related to age, sex, body mass index, triceps skinfold and lipid profile. Materials and methods. School age children from 5 provinces of central-eastern Colombia were examined. Measurements included body mass index, body fat reserves, leptin concentrations and lipid profile. Results. The overall leptin concentrations were 8.3 +/- 8.9 ng/ml. The concentrations varied by differences in the age and sex, but were equal in children with higher body weight and greater fat deposition. A positive relationship was observed between high leptin levels and high total cholesterol in males, and in females, an association of high leptin levels with high levels of triglycerides. Conclusion. The leptin concentrations followed a trend similar to those of other population groups with differences according to the age, sex and deposits of fat mass. However, the values seem to be influenced by hormonal differences and food habits. In addition, overweight or obese school children probably have hyperleptinemia, correlated to metabolic syndrome, diabetes mellitus type 2 and cardiovascular diseases.

Ancient bone remains constitute an important source of biological information, and their genetic characterization allows the confirmation or rebuttal of human affiliations proposed on the basis of non-molecular approaches. Pre-Columbian history of the Eastern Andes in Colombia has been divided into three main periods: (i) an early colonization by groups of hunter-gatherers, (ii) an intermediate period ""Herrera"" characterized by primitive agriculture and (iii) a late stage of Chibcha-speaking groups, with agriculture and ceramics (""agroalfarero""). Objective. The mitochondrial DNA on ancient bone remains of the Herrera period were analyzed for comparison with modern and other ancient DNAs. Materials and methods. Mitochondrial DNA was extracted from 11 Herrera individuals [similar to 2,000 years before present (YBP)] found in the Madrid 2-41 archaeological site near Bogota, Colombia. A 192 bp segment of the hypervariable segment I was amplified and sequenced, following stringent archaic DNA authenticity criteria. The sequences were compared with those in American and European databases using bioinformatics tools. Results. All individuals had identical sequences and were classified as haplogroup B. This identity may be related to the type of ritual burial performed in the site, probably exclusively for members of a hierarchically important family of the ancient Herrera society. The search for homologous sequences in the American and European mtDNA data bases produced no identical coincidences, although a Brazilian Amazonic individual (similar to 4,000 YBP) was recorded with a matching sequence.

Results: The rate of malformed infants was 2.08%. The detection rate of diagnosable congenital anomalies was 31.45% among cases that had information about prenatal care. This rate is lower than that reported in the literature. Most of the congenital anomalies detected were of the central nervous system and of the genitourinary system. Conclusions: The low detection rate highlights the need to improve the quality of ultrasound to have greater sensitivity for adequate prenatal diagnosis that will contribute to the reduction of morbidity and mortality and allow for better care of newborns with malformations.",Article,"Garcia, M.A.; Imbachi, L.; Hurtado, P.M.; Gracia, G.; Zarante, I.",Ultrasonography; prenatal; prenatal diagnosis; congenital abnormalities; infant mortality; prognosis,Ultrasonography;prenatal;prenatal diagnosis;congenital abnormalities;infant mortality;prognosis;PRENATAL-DIAGNOSIS;MALFORMATIONS,Colombia,2-s2.0-84909643754

This study estimates its incidence, compares it with historical data and describes associated factors. Materials and methods: We carried out a prospective analytical cohort of preterm newborns <= 34 weeks of gestational age without major malformations from 12 health facilities from Bogota in 2004. The main outcomes were incidence and severity of bronchopulmonary dysplasia, which were compared with an historical cohort (1994-1999). Results: Neonatal mortality was 80/496, and the bronchopulmonary dysplasia incidence was 54.3% (95% CI, 49.4-59.1). When controlling for type of institution (low and high mortality) it appeared that being born in an institution with low mortality decreased the risk for death (OR=0.308; 95% CI, 0.129-0.736) but increased the odds for moderate-severe bronchopulmonary dysplasia (OR=1.797; 95% CI, 1.046-3.088). The risk for bronchopulmonary dysplasia was higher than for the historical control cohort (RR=1.924; 95% CI, 1.686-2.196). Weight and gestational age at birth, mechanical ventilation, intrauterine growth restriction and type of institution (low vs. intermediate-high mortality) were independently associated with bronchopulmonary dysplasia of increasing severity or even death. Conclusions: The frequency of bronchopulmonary dysplasia in Bogota has increased markedly, and this cannot be explained solely by better survival of more fragile infants. Survivors-irrespective from gestational age-have more frequent and more severe respiratory sequels. Probably suboptimal aggressive respiratory care practices associated with a recent transition from restricted to almost universal access to mechanical ventilation in neonatal intensive care units in Bogota might be compromising the quality of neonatal respiratory care.",Article,"Ruiz-Pelaez, J.G.; Charpak, N.",Infant; premature; bronchopulmonary dysplasia; kangaroo-mother care method; nurseries; hospitals; cohort studies; developing country,Infant;premature;bronchopulmonary dysplasia;kangaroo-mother care method;nurseries;hospitals;cohort studies;developing country;CHRONIC LUNG-DISEASE;RISK,Colombia,2-s2.0-84901308537

Reference values for pulmonary function parameters, generally applicable to most populations, have shown little validity in the correct interpretation of pulmonary function tests when applied to the adult population in Bogota. Objective. To identify which of four prediction models generated for use in populations of a similar ethnic background to that found in Colombia is the most accurate for use in adults in Bogota. Materials and methods. 534 subjects (male and female) between 18 and 65 years of age were recruited from a pool of workers employed by three private Bogota companies. All subjects had resided in Bogota for at least five years before the initiation of the study. Smokers and those with altered pulmonary function were excluded. Pulmonary function parameters were measured by flow volume curve. The results were analyzed (specifically, the difference between predicted and observed values) and the limits were calculated using the Bland & Altman method. A maximum average prediction error of 5% was accepted as valid for the observed value of each parameter. Results. The models shown to be valid were as follows: Crapo for forced vital capacity (FVC) in men; Perez-Padilla for FVC in women and for the ratio forced expiratory volume in the first second (FEV1/FVC) in both sexes, and the Hankinson model for Mexican-Americans, for all parameters in both sexes. Conclusions. The Hankinson model proved to be the most accurate in predicting all spirometry parameters. However, its poor classification average (7%) is a limitation.

Age-dependent comorbidities, such as hearing disorders, are more prevalent and affect the quality of life in a noticeable manner. Objective: To estimate the prevalence of hearing disorders, of the associated factors and their impact on the quality of life of older adults in Bogota. Materials and methods: Data was taken from the Bogota SABE Study, which included 2,000 individuals aged >= 60 years in a probabilistic cross-sectional study sampled by clusters (with 81.9% coverage). We used the ""hearing disorders"" variable relating it to socio-demographic variables, as well as to the use of hearing aids, the self-perceived health, the comorbidities, the functionality, the cognition and the quality of life as measured with the Visual Analog Scale of the EuroQol Group (EQ-VAS). Results: We found a prevalence of hearing disorders in 267 individuals (13.5%), of whom 15% used hearing aids. The frequency was higher in individuals aged >= 75 years (46.1%), in the low socioeconomic level (20.2%) and among illiterate people (19.3%, p<0.05). Regarding comorbidities, we found a higher prevalence in individuals suffering from depression (20.2%, p<0.001), and high blood pressure (15%, p<0.01). The quality of life was worse in individuals with hearing disorders, as measured with the EuroQol EQ-VAS (60.93 +/- 1.38 vs. 71.75 +/- 0.45, p< 0.0001), but it improved among those who used hearing aids as compared to those who did not use them (59.59 +/- 1.52, p<0.01).

Objective: To evaluate the risk factors for presentation of bacteremia due to carbapenem-resistant P. aeruginosa acquired in the Hospital Universitario San Ignacio between January 2008 and June 2014. Materials and methods: This was a case control study in which the case patients presented bacteremia due to P. aeruginosa resistant to carbapenems and the control group included patients with P. aeruginosa susceptible to this group of antibiotics. Variables such as the previous use of meropenem and ertapenem, immunosuppression and neoplasia were measured. Mortality and duration of hospital were also described. Results: In all, 168 patients were evaluated, of which 42 were cases and 126 controls. Using a multivariate model, the risk factors related to bacteremia due to carbapenem-resistant P. aeruginosa acquired in hospital were the following: use of parenteral nutrition (OR=8.28; 95% CI: 2.56-26.79; p=0); use of meropenem (OR=1.15; 95% CI: 1.03-1.28; p=0.01); and use of ciprofloxacin (OR=81.99; 95% CI: 1.14-5884; p=0.043).

This presentation may have a mortality rate as high as 90% without proper treatment and diagnosis, dropping to 12% with timely diagnosis and treatment. We present the case of a 55 year-old female patient hospitalized for two weeks with constitutional symptoms, intermittent fever, dry cough, pleuritic pain and some symptoms of heart failure. The imaging studies (chest x-rays and ultrasound), revealed bilateral pleural effusion: 300 cc on the right side, 1,000 cc on the left side, and 500 cc of pericardial effusion. Direct bacilloscopy of the pleural fluid, the pericardial fluid and the sputum were negative, as well as the C-reactive protein (CRP); however, the Lowenstein-Jensen culture of the pericardial fluid was positive for Mycobacterium tuberculosis. The result of the purified protein derivative (PPD) test showed a 23 mm swelling, and after quadruple therapy her clinical condition rapidly improved until final discharge.

Streptococcus pneumoniae is a commonly implicated agent in invasive disease. For infections of S. pneumoniae resistant to beta-lactam. macrolides are an alternative treatment. However, resistance to macrolides has increased worldwide as well. Objective. The frequency of resistance to erythromycin was determined for S. pneumoniae over a 15-year surveillance period, and the resistant isolates were characterized phenotypically and genotypically. Materials and methods. Demographic data of the patients, antimicrobial susceptibility and serotypes were analyzed for 3,241 S. pneumoniae isolates recovered between 1994 and 2008. The phenotypes were determined by the double-disc technique and genotypes by PCR (polymerase chain reaction) and PFGE (pulsed field gel electrophoresis). Isolates were recovered from invasive diseases and were provided by national public health laboratories. Results. Of the 3,241 isolates, 136 were resistant to erythromycin. In the 12-year period between 19941996 and 2006-2008, resistance in each 2-year sampling had increased from 2.4% to 6.9% in children under 6 years and from 3.3% to 5.7% in adults. The most common serotypes were 6B (36.8%). 14 (16.9%) and 6A (17.6%). Constitutive phenotype cMLSB was determined in 87 isolates; 82 of these expressed the ermB gene. Phenotype M was determined in 46 isolates; 45 had the mefA gene. An additional three isolates expressed the inducible phenotype (iMLS(B)), and one expressed the ermB gene. By PFGE, 50 of the isolates were found to be related to international clones-58% were Spain(6B)-ST90, 26% Spain(9V)-ST156, 8% Colombia(23F)-ST338 and 8% Spain(23F)-ST81. Conclusion.

Lipid and apolipoprotein are known to vary in children. These variations can be associated to physiologic changes or the environment; this last one probably induces future alterations in the lipids. Objetive. The levels of total cholesterol, LDL-cholesterol, HDL-cholesterol, and apoproteins A-I and B-100 were compared in school children from five provinces of middle-eastern Colombia. Associations were made with age, gender, body mass index, fitness activity, and food preference. Materials and methods. 741 blood samples were collected and biochemical determinations were undertaken with standard enzymatic, colorimetric, and inmunoturbidimetric methods. All values are presented as mean ± SE, comparisons among groups were made using Student's t test, ANOVA and Scheffe. Results. Lipid variation was observed in the school children, however in contrast, the concentrations of Apoproteins ApoB-100 and ApoA-I tended to be constant. The lipid fluctuations showed some relationship with changes in age and gender, however, changes were also observed that indicate a possible relationship with sexual maturation, diet and fitness activity. An important finding was that the HDL cholesterol value was lower that reported from other countries, while the triglycerides was higher and this may indicate a future increased risk for cardiovascular diseases. Conclusion. Fluctuations occur in the lipid levels and vary with age and gender. Associations with other factors may be present; however, more research is necessary to determinate the contribution of each factor.

Objectives: To provide clinical practice recommendations based upon efficacy and safety of smoking cessation therapies for Colombian adults. Materials and methods: An adaptation of clinical practice guidelines (CPG) based on the ADAPT methodology was performed. We searched CPG on Medline, EMBASE, CINAHL, LILACS, and Cochrane databases. Six months' cessation rates were appraised for brief and intensive counseling, nicotine replacement therapy (NRT), bupropion, varenicline, clonidine, nortriptyline, acupuncture, hypnosis, homeopathy, and combined treatments. CPG were evaluated with DELBI and selected when having a score above 60% for methodological rigor of development and applicability to the Colombian health system. Formal consensus was performed for questions without strong evidence. Results: 925 references were found, 17 CPG were pre-selected and 5 selected for adaptation. Brief and intensive counseling, NRT, bupropion, nortriptyline, and varenicline are effective for smoking cessation (cessation rates augment 5.1%-22.7%). Alternative therapies have not demonstrated cessation efficacy. Concomitant use of different NRT is the only combination with demonstrated efficacy (OR 1.9, 95%CI 1.3-2.7). Conclusions: Several alternatives for giving up tobacco smoking have confirmed efficacy.

Objective: To quantify total and average years of life lost due to cancer in Colombia, and to investigate changes in this burden between 1997 and 2012. Materials and methods: We obtained sex-specific data on age distribution, remaining life expectancy, deaths due to specific cancers and total number of deaths from the Colombian Departamento Administrativo Nacional de Estadisticas. We calculated years of life lost based on each individual's age at death and the remaining life expectancy at that age; as for average years of life, we divided these by the number of deaths due to specific cancers. Results: The total number of cancer deaths increased by 33% between 1997 and 2012, comprising 15% of male and 20% of female deaths in the period 2010-2012. Total years of life lost due to cancer increased by 25.1% for males and 31.1% for females over the study period.

Food borne diseases are a serious public health problem. Poultry are often associated with these outbreaks. Objective. A systematic review of the literature is provided concerning the distribution and frequency of food borne outbreaks associated with consumption of chicken contaminated with Salmonella spp., Listeria monocytogenes and Staphylococcus aureus. Materials and methods. The search for studies of outbreaks associated with Salmonella, S. aureus and L. monocytogenes was conducted in Medline, Pubmed, Science Direct, Scielo, Cochrane Library (CCRT), Virtual Health Library (VHL), Highwire, HINARI and MedicLatina. Data were obtained for the calculation of odds ratio (OR) by preparing contingency tables using the RevMan5 program. Results. Seven articles met the inclusion criteria; however, no reports of L. monocytogenes were obtained. The overall OR was 3.01 (95% Cl: 2.37, 3.81); this was interpreted as a significant association between the consumption of contaminated chicken and food poisoning. In the included studies heterogeneity (p=0.03)was presented, so it took a subgroup analysis of microorganisms, in the case of Salmonella OR was 2.67 (95% Cl: 2.09-3.41).

More information is needed on the risk of venous thromboembolism in the hospital setting, and on patterns of use of thromboprophylaxis, as advocated in consensus guidelines. ENDORSE was an international study aimed at evaluating hospital venous thromboembolism prevention practices in medical and surgical patientes. Objectives. The risk of venous thromboembolism was evaluated along with the use of thromboprophylaxis in hospitalized medical and surgical subjects; these data were compared with the international sample from the ENDORSE study. Materials and methods. Participating institutions in Colombia were selected arbitrarily. The medical charts for medical and surgical patients were evaluated randomly. The 2004 American College of Chest Physician guidelines were used to evaluate risk of venous thromboembolism and adherence to recommended thromboprophylaxis regimens. Results. The study included 761 subjects (218 surgical, 543 medical) located in five acute care hospitals; 49% of these subjects were considered at risk of venous thromboembolism (40% medical, 72% surgical), compared with 52% in the international sample. Prophylaxis use was higher in medical patients at risk (63.7%, n=137) than in surgical patients (48.4%, n=76; p=0.01). Compared with the international sample, the use of prophylaxis in Colombia was greater in medical patients (63.7% vs. 39.5%, p=0.003), but lower in surgical patients (48.4% vs. 58.5%, p=0.02). Conclusions.

In Colombia, surnames are characters usually passed to the children by the father, and they have been compared to neutral alleles associated with the Y-chromosome. Objective. Population frequencies were determined for 17 short tandem repeats (STR) DNA markers on the Y-chromosome to compare the two identity codes and define the correlation between haplotypes and surnames in each individual. Materials and methods. DNA was extracted from blood samples from 308 male individuals in provinces of Valle del Cauca, Cauca and Narino, all in southwestern Colombia. Sample DNA was analyzed with the commercial kit AmpFLSTR (R) Yfiler (TM) (Applied Biosystems) and examined for the following 17 Y-chromosome STR markers: DYS19, DYS389I, DYS389II, DYS390, DYS391, DYS392, DYS393, DYS385a/b, DYS437, DYS438, DYS439, DYS448, DYS456, DYS458, DYS635 and Y-GATA-H4. The frequencies of molecular haplotypes were associated with the surname reported by each individual, and a correlation table was constructed. Amerindian and European surnames were associated with the presence of allele DYS19/13, a characteristic of Amerindian populations. Results. Allele frequencies were reported for each of the 17 STR markers in the southwestern region of Colombia-high genetic and haplotypic diversities were obtained. Approximately 40% of lineage inconsistencies were found when the molecular genotype was compared with the European or Amerindian surnames. Conclusions.

Objectives: To compare pulmonary function in patients with type 2 diabetes treated with an insulin-sensitizing agent (metformin) and in those treated with secretagogues, as well as combined with insulin, and to evaluate differences in inflammatory biomarkers between treatment groups. Material and methods: We conducted a cross-sectional analytic study in 196 diabetic patients with type 2 diabetic mellitus. Spirometric variables and levels of inflammatory biomarkers (ferritin, fibrinogen, C-reactive protein, interleukin 6, tumor necrosis factor-alpha), were obtained. Residual values (observed minus expected) for forced vital capacity and for forced expiratory volume were calculated and compared between treatment types. Differences in median levels of biomarkers were also compared. Results: After adjustment by known determinants of lung function, and by the control and duration of type 2 diabetes, patients treated with the insulin-sensitizing agent had statistically significant lower differences against expected values for forced vital capacity compared with secretagogues (-212.1 ml vs 270.2 ml, p=0.039), as well as for forced expiratory volume, but without statistical significance (-133.2 mL vs -174.8 mL, p>0.05). In the group of patients treated with the insulin-sensitizing agent, ferritin and tumor necrosis factor-alpha levels were lower (p<0.01).

Trypanosoma rangeli has been classified in the KP1 (+) and KP1 (-) subpopulations, based on the mini-exon gene and kinetoplast DNA minicircle amplification profiles. Objective. The intergenic region of the histone h2a gene was compared between KP1(+) and KP1 (-) strains of T. rangeli to substantiate this classification. Materials and methods. The amplification, cloning and sequencing of the h2a gene intergenic region was undertaken for the Tre and 5048 [KP1(-)] strains for comparison with the Choachi [KP1 (+)] strain. These sequences, along with those previously reported for the KP1 (+) and KP1 (-) H14 and C23 strains, were used to reconstruct phylogenetic trees based on the ""neighbor-joining"", maximum parsimony and maximum likelihood methods. The Y strain of Trypanosoma cruzi was chosen as the outgroup. Results. Intra-specific heterogeneity was observed in the size of the gene region under study, supported by bootstarp values of 85% (neigh bor-joining), 66% (maximum parsimony) and 57% (maximum likelihood). The KP1(-) strains were grouped apart, clearly differentiated from the KP1 (+) strains. The latter demonstrated a higher intra-specific heterogeneity, both in sequence length and composition. In addition, a closer phylogenetic relationship between T. rangeli and T. cruzi was found to be more closely related to one another than to T. rangeli and Trypanosoma brucei. Conclusion.

The kinetoplastid membrane protein 11, KMP-11, from Trypanosoma cruzi elicits humoral and cellular immunity in mice that protects them from infection against further parasite challenge. Objective. To characterize the expression of surface markers on dendritic cells from chronic chagasic patients and healthy individuals, in response to the KMP-11 protein from Trypanosoma cruzi and its N-terminal pepticle K1. Materials and methods. Monocyte-derived dendritic cells from seven chronic chagasic patients and seven healthy individuals were stimulated with the KIMP-11 protein and the K1 peptide. Seven days after culturing, the CD83, CD86, and HLA-DR membrane expression as well as the production of cytokines were evaluated by flow cytometry. Results. Neither KMP-11 protein nor K1 peptide elicited the expression of the maturation marker CD83 on dendritic cells of patients or healthy control individuals. Dendritic cells from chronic chagasic patients exposed to K1 and LIPS at the same time presented a significant reduction in CD86 and CD83 membrane expression in contrast to the cells exposed to LPS alone, whereas dendritic cells from healthy individuals did not show this behavior. The secretion of interleukin-12 was decreased in the cultures of dendritic cells from chronic chagasic patients but not from healthy controls. Conclusions.

Clarithromycin and metronidazole being the main responsible for antibiotic resistance. In Colombia, the primary resistance as consequence of these two antibiotics and the excessive use of levofloxacin is above the accepted limit (13.6%, 83% and 16%, respectively). Despite this fact, empirical therapies are used in patients with previous therapeutic failure that include the combination of these antibiotics. Objective: To determine antibiotic resistance in patients previously treated for H. pylori in Bogotá-Colombia. Materials and methods: Descriptive study that include 10 isolates obtained from 5 patients with 3 or 4 previous failed treatments for H. pylori. Antibiotic resistance to amoxicillin, clarithromycin, levofloxacin and metronidazole was investigated by agar dilution. Antibiotic resistance was confirmed by DNA sequencing (Magrogen - Korea). Results: Eight isolates were resistant to two or more antibiotics. All isolates were resistant to levofloxacin. Susceptibility patterns in isolates from the antrum and body of the stomach were different in 3 patients. Conclusion: This is the first evidence of multiple H. pylori resistance in Colombia in patients previously treated for H. pylori. The results demonstrate the consequences of using an ineffective antibiotic scheme.

Breast reconstruction, either immediate or delayed, is part of the treatment of breast cancer. Each country and health system pays for and evaluates these procedures in different ways. Thus, it is important to determine which strategy is most cost-effective in Colombia. Objective: To evaluate the cost-utility of breast cancer treatment with immediate reconstruction compared with delayed reconstruction. Materials and methods: We used a decision tree model and a one-year time horizon from the perspective of the third-party payer; the cost data were taken from the Colombian Instituto de Seguros Sociales 2001 rate manual plus a 30% adjustment according to the methodology of the Instituto de Evaluacion Tecnologica en Salud, IETS, and the billing model of the Centro Javeriano de Oncologia at the Hospital Universitario San Ignacio. The transition probabilities and profits were obtained from medical specialists, patients, and the medical literature. We also conducted univariate and probabilistic sensitivity analyses. Results: The expected costs per capita were COP$ 26,710,605 (USD$ 11,165) for the immediate reconstruction and COP$ 26,459,557 (USD$ 11,060) for the deferred reconstruction. Immediate reconstruction generated an incremental cost of COP$ 251,049 (USD$ 105) and 0.75 quality-adjusted life years (QALY), while deferred reconstruction generated 0.63 QALYs, with an incremental cost-utility ratio of COP$ 2,154,675 per QALY (USD$ 901). Conclusions: The cost per QALY did not exceed the acceptability threshold of the Gross Domestic Product (GDP) per capita. The costs for the first year were similar.

Sequencing of exon 13 of the USH2A gene was performed for all the individuals because the most frequent mutation is located in this exon. Results. The most frequent mutation was c.2299delG, identified in the 27% (n=8) of the sample. The second mutation, p.R334W, showed a frequency of 15%. A new variant identified in the 5'UTR region, g.129G>T, was present in 1 individual (4%). Four polymorphisms were identified; one of them is a new deletion in exon 20, first reported in this study. Conclusions. Mutations in the usherin short isoform were identified in 38% of a sample of 26 USH2 cases.

Additionally, 20% of the world's adult population will develop metabolic syndrome during their lifespan with tremendous effects for their wellbeing and the health systems. Objective: To identify social, biological, and behavioral factors associated with the metabolic syndrome in adults to help in the design of health policies in urban environments. Materials and methods: We included 300 cases and 675 controls. For cases, the waist circumference (abdominal obesity) in men was ≥94 cm and ≥88 cm in women, and other two factors should be present including hypertension, high glycated hemoglobin, high triglycerides, and low HDL levels. Controls presented only one or none of these risk factors. Results: The total prevalence of metabolic syndrome was 30.2%, 33.6% in females, and 25.6% in males. Therefore, females had a higher risk of developing a metabolic syndrome (OR=1.70; 95% CI 1.17-2.47). Being a mestizo also increased the risk of having metabolic syndrome (OR=1.55; 95% CI 1.10-2.19). In contrast, frequent fruit consumption and being a housekeeper were protective factors: OR=0.83; 95% CI 0.69-1.00, and OR=0.58; 95% CI 0.36-0.92, respectively. Logistic regression showed that obesity had the strongest association with metabolic syndrome (OR=7.52; 95% CI 4.79-11.80). Increasing age yielded a linear trend with regard to metabolic syndrome: the OR for the 40 to 49-year-old group was 4.24 (95% CI 2.20-8.16), for the 50 to 59-year-old group, 4.63 (95% CI 2.40-8.93), and for those over 80 years of age, 5.32 (95% CI 1.92-14.71). Conclusion: Obesity was the main risk factor associated with the metabolic syndrome.

At present, there are only two consolidation treatment alternatives: Chemotherapy and stem-cell transplantation. Objective: To evaluate the cost-effectiveness of unrelated and related hematopoietic stem cell transplantations, versus chemotherapy consolidation in pediatric patients with high-risk acute myeloid leukemia. Materials and methods: A decision tree was constructed with life-years gained as the outcome. Costs and probabilities were extracted from the literature. Probabilistic sensitivity analyses and acceptability curves were computed. The cost-effectiveness threshold was three times the 2010 per capita gross domestic product. Results: When compared to consolidation chemotherapy cycles, related and unrelated hematopoietic stem-cell transplantation had incremental cost-effectiveness ratios of COP$ 9,226,421 (USD$ 4,820) and COP$ 6,544,116 (USD$ 3,419) respectively, which are lower than the per capita gross domestic product (COP$ 12,047,418, USD$ 6,294). Transplant proved to be cost-effective in 70% of the simulations and had a higher probability of the willingness to pay being over than COP$ 7,200,000 (USD$ 3,762).

In Colombia, congenital malformations are the second leading cause of infant mortality. Objective: To determine the geographical distribution of extended perinatal mortality due to congenital malformations in Colombia between 1999 and 2008. Materials and methods: We conducted a cross-sectional study. We revised all death certificates issued between 1999 and 2008. We defined perinatal mortality as fetal or non-fetal deaths within the first 28 days after delivery in children with body weight >= 500 grams, and congenital malformations according to ICD-10 diagnostic codes Q000 - Q999. The annual birth projection was used as the denominator. We defined high mortality areas due to congenital malformations as those in the 90th percentile. Results: We recorded 22,361 perinatal deaths due to congenital malformations. The following provinces exceeded the 90th perinatal mortality percentile: Antioquia, Caldas, Risaralda, Huila, Quindio, Bogota, Valle del Cauca and Guainla. Among the municipalities, the highest perinatal mortality rates were found in Giraldo, Ciudad Bolivar, Riosucio, Liborina, Supia, Alejandria, Sopetran, San Jeronimo, Santa Fe de Antioquia and Marmato (205.81 and 74.18 per 10.000 live births). The perinatal mortality rate due to malformations of the circulatory system was 28.1 per 10.000 live births, whereas the rates for central nervous system defects and chromosomal abnormalities were 13.7 and 7.0, respectively.

Objective: The phosphorylation by IGF-I of IGF-IR and the intracellular signaling molecules Akt (PI-3K pathway) and Erk1/2 (MAPK pathway) was characterized in a human breast cancer cell lines. Materials and methods: The study compared a standard breast adenocarcinoma line (MCF-7) cell line with a line (CSC 1595) derived from an infiltrating ductal breast cancer in a Colombian patient. The CSC 1595 and MCF-7 cell lines were cultured in DMEM supplemented with 10% fetal bovine serum, 2 mM glutamine, 100 U/ml penicillin, and 100 μg/ml streptomycin and grown at 37 °C in 5% CO2 atmosphere and 95% humidity. Cell extracts were prepared, followed by immunoprecipitation and immunoblotting with specific anti-pIGF-IR, anti-pERK1/2 and anti-pAkt antibodies. Results: After 5 minute stimulation with IGF-I, 70% of the IGF-IR was phosphorylated in the cell line CSC 1595 and 25% in MCF-7. In addition, Akt (oncogene protein v-akt) and ERK1/2 (extracellular signal-regulated MAP kinases) were phosphorylated. Basal and stimulated levels of phosphorylated ERK1/2 were substantially higher compared to those in the MCF-7 cell line. Conclusions: The IGF-IR and MAPK kinase pathway involving proteins ERK1/2 showed more significant phosphorylation in the 1,595 cells compared to the observed in the MCF-7 cell line. Since the IGF-IR is the major activator of this pathway it may play an important role in ductal infiltrating breast cancer tumor growth and metastases.",Article,"Unknown.; Castro, Carlos.; Unknown.; Unknown.; Unknown.; Unknown",1-phosphatidylinositol 3-kinase;Breast neoplasms;Cell line;IGF type 1;Mitogen-activated protein kinase 1;Oncogene protein v-akt;Receptor,1-phosphatidylinositol 3-kinase;Breast neoplasms;Cell line;IGF type 1;Mitogen-activated protein kinase 1;Oncogene protein v-akt;Receptor,Colombia;Colombia;Colombia,

Treatment with interferon beta delays the progression of multiple sclerosis for nearly two years in patients with a clinically isolated syndrome. In Colombia, interferon is very expensive when compared to other countries. Objective: We sought to determine the cost-effectiveness of a two-year interferon beta treatment within Colombia in patients with a clinically isolated syndrome. Materials and methods: Based on patient and society perspectives, a cost-effectiveness analysis was conducted using a decision tree. A variety of probabilities were defined after a systematic review of the available literature. The disease costs were calculated by reviewing medical charts at the Hospital San Ignacio University and surveys completed by multiple sclerosis patients. To control for uncertainty in these data, analysis of approximately one-thousand patients was performed using Monte Carlo methods. Results: The two-year treatment cost per patient exceeds Col$ 95,000,000 (US$ 50,000). Approximately 80 % of this cost corresponds to medications (US$ 40,500). The price of relapse and indirect costs totals Col$ 41,632,149 (US$ 21,744) and Col$ 11,656,389 (US$ 6,088), respectively. Treatment represents an increase of 0.06 quality-adjusted life years (QALY).

Cardiomyopathy is the most common clinical form of Chagas' disease in Colombia, and one treatment option is a heart transplant. Tracking the behavior of the Chagas' parasite, Trypanosoma cruzi, is a priority due to the risk of post-transplant reactivation of the infection. Objective. A case is presented of a patient who had suffered from dilated chagasic cardiopathy and cardiac failure, and had subsequently undergone heart transplant. The case was monitored by PCR, histopathological and echocardiographic examinations. Materials and methods. Blood samples were drawn before and after the transplant, and post-transplant endomyocardial biopsies were taken. The extracted DNA was amplified with the TcH2AF-R and S35-S36 primers. Parasitemia was examined by the microhematocrit test. In addition, histopathological studies determined the parasite presence and transplant rejection status. Echocardiograms were administered to evaluate cardiac function. Results. Of the blood samples taken 83 and 48 days pre-transplant, the latter was positive by the S35-S36 PCR test. PCR tests in blood with both primers were negative up to the second month post-transplant. However, both PCR tests were positive by the third month post-transplant. Thereupon, the patient was treated with nifurtimox. Both tests presented negative results in blood 35 days after treatment was started and remained negative thereafter at 0, 3, 10 and 12 months post-treatment. The pathology, microhematocrit, and PCR test results from biopsies were negative on all the specified dates. Conclusions.

Objective: To examine the role of chronic stress in the relationship between socioeconomic status and pharmacological adherence in hypertensive patients aged 45 to 70 years old in three Colombian cities between 2015 and 2016. Materials and methods: We conducted a cross-sectional study in a population of hypertensive patients. Data for this study came from the first wave of longitudinal study aimed at examining social factors associated with the control of hypertension in Bogota, Medellin, and Quibdo. Patients with hypertension were selected randomly from a sample of those participating in the hypertension control program De todo corazon. For the statistical analysis of the data, we used factorial analysis and multivariate regressions. Results: We found a positive association between socioeconomic status and the degree of pharmacological adherence and a negative one with chronic stress.

Studies on leptin administration have demonstrated a reversion of insulin resistance, and that leptin produces effects in glucose metabolism. Objective. Changes in the insulin and glucose concentrations in blood plasma was evaluated by intraperitoneal administration of mimetic leptin peptides in Wistar rats fed with high fat diet. Materials and methods. A control group of rats was defined that were fed with high fat diet and a control group with normal diet. Several treatments groups were fed with high fat diet and subjected to the administration of seven different mimetic leptin peptides, each one administered in four different concentrations. During the peptide administration the glucose concentrations were quantified and at the end the insulin concentrations. Results. The average insulin concentrations in the control groups were similar; however, hyperinsulinemia was observed in the groups to which we administered the peptide denominated 83 at doses of 10 mg/kg and 20 mg/kg of body weight. All the treatment groups except the peptide denominated with the code 80 showed diminished glucose levels even in the cases without hyperglycemia. The greatest effect was observed with the peptide 116-130 of the mouse leptin and its human homolog, although without statistical differences with the other treatments. Conclusion.

However, the presence of pathogens of fecal origin creates a sanitary risk to farmers and consumers. Objective: To determine the presence and concentration of helminth eggs in irrigation waters, biosolids, agricultural soils, and pastures. Materials and methods: Water, biosolids, soil, and pasture samples were collected and analyzed for helminth egg detection, total eggs and viable eggs counts. The behavior of helminth eggs was evaluated in irrigation waters and dairy cattle grassland, where biosolids had been used as an organic amendment. Results: Concentrations between 0.1-3 total helminth eggs/L, and 0.1-1 viable helminth eggs/L were found in water. In biosolids and soil, we found 3-22 total helminth eggs/4 g of dry weight, and 2-12 viable helminth eggs/4 g of dry weight, and in grass, we found < 2-9 total helminth eggs/g of fresh weight, and < 1-3 viable helminth eggs/g of fresh weight. The presence of helminth eggs in each matrix varied from days to months, which may represent a sanitary risk to farmers as well as to consumers.

Thrombosis develops when the hemostatic system is incorrectly activated due to the unbalance between procoagulant, anticoagulant and fibrinolytic mechanisms allowing the formation of a clot within a blood vessel. The risk factors of this pathology can be acquired or can be genetic. Objectives. To analyze in a Colombian population with diagnosis of venous thrombosis, lipid profile, glucose and homocystein levels, to calculate the alleles and genotypic frequencies of polymorphisms c.699 C>T, c.1080 C>T, c.844ins68 of the cystathionine beta synthase and the c.677 C>T of the methylenetetrahydrofolate reductase (MTHFR) genes. Materials and methods. Thirty three patients and their controls were studied. The biochemical test was carried out by colorimetric methods and immunoassay. In this survey we used the restriction fragments longitude polymorphism (RLFP) technique to identify the polymorphisms mentioned. The association study was performed through the chi square test. Results.

In vitro studies strongly suggest that proliferation, migration and cell survival of breast cancer cell lines are significantly affected by activation of the IGF type 1 receptor (IGF-IR). Objective. The phosphorylation by IGF-I of IGF-IR and the intracellular signaling molecules Akt (PI-3K pathway) and Erk1/2 (MAPK pathway) was characterized in a human breast cancer cell lines. Materials and methods. The study compared a standard breast adenocarcinoma line (MCF-7) cell line with a line (CSC 1595) derived from an infiltrating ductal breast cancer in a Colombian patient. The CSC 1595 and MCF-7 cell lines were cultured in DMEM supplemented with 10% fetal bovine serum, 2 mM glutamine, 100 U/ml penicillin, and 100 mu g/ml streptomycin and grown at 37 degrees C in 5% CO2 atmosphere and 95% humidity. Cell extracts were prepared, followed by immunoprecipitation and immunoblotting with specific anti-pIGF-IR, anti-pERK1/2 and anti-pAkt antibodies. Results. After 5 minute stimulation with IGF-I, 70% of the IGF-IR was phosphorylated in the cell line CSC 1595 and 25% in MCF-7. In addition, Akt (oncogene protein v-akt) and ERK1/2 (extracellular signal-regulated MAP kinases) were phosphorylated. Basal and stimulated levels of phosphorylated ERK1/2 were substantially higher compared to those in the MCF-7 cell line. Conclusions. The IGF-IR and MAPK kinase pathway involving proteins ERK1/2 showed more significant phosphorylation in the 1,595 cells compared to the observed in the MCF-7 cell line. Since the IGF-IR is the major activator of this pathway it may play an important role in ductal infiltrating breast cancer tumor growth and metastases.",Article,"Mejia, W.; Castro, C.; Umana, A.; de Castro, C.; Riveros, T.; Sanchez-Gomez, M.",breast neoplasms; cell line; receptor; IGF type 1; mitogen-activated protein kinase 1; 1-phosphatidylinositol 3-kinase; oncogene protein v-akt,breast neoplasms;cell line;receptor;IGF type 1;mitogen-activated protein kinase 1;1-phosphatidylinositol 3-kinase;oncogene protein v-akt;ESTROGEN-RECEPTOR;ENDOCRINE RESISTANCE;PATHWAYS;SYSTEM,Colombia,

Mathematical models that correlate chemical structure with biological activity have been useful in the design of new drugs and can be used to predict biological behavior of new, chemically related molecules. Objectives. A mathematical model was generated to correlate the substrate affinities with variations in the molecular topology of glycine antagonists in NMIDA sub-class glutamate receptor and, subsequently, to propose new molecules with antagonist activity. Materials and methods. By use of molecular connectivity indexes, the electronic structure and atomic bonding patterns of 45 glycine antagonists were coded. Correlation between connectivity indexes and antagonist affinity was determined by regression analysis. Results. The connectivity index that best described affinity behavior was 4Xvpc, which indicates the relative importance of heteroatoms, the vicinity of aromatic ring substitutes, and valency gradient. The equations generated predicted new antagonist affinities, and the model was able to suggest structural requirements for designating compounds with increased affinity. Twelve new molecules were proposed, from which three appeared promising-based of the affinities previously calculated by means of the new equations. Energetic interaction analysis was developed as a control for the mathematical methodology. Conclusion. Glycine antagonists' structure were analyzed mathematically by means of connectivity indexes. The equations modeled receptor behavior and contributed useful information for new antagonist design.",Article,"Narvaez, G.; Lareo, L.; Rincon, J.",glycine/antagonists & inhibitors; glutamate; N-methylaspartate/pharmacology.,glycine/antagonists & inhibitors;glutamate;N-methylaspartate/pharmacology.;NMDA RECEPTOR;SITE;CONNECTIVITY;INHIBITION;POTENT;QSAR,Colombia,2-s2.0-35449003220

Previous studies have shown its importance in in vitro generation of tolerogenic DC, which have a similar function and phenotype to that of CD141 dermal DCs that produce IL-10 and induce (LTreg) CD4+ T regulator cells. Objective: This paper presents a study that compares the phenotype and cytokines produced by DC generated in presence and absence of VD3, which were matured with lipopolysaccharide (LPS), and their ability to induce LTreg from naïve allogeneic CD4+ T cells. Materials and methods: In order to compare them, peripheral blood mononuclear cells were isolated to select monocytes CD14+ T cells and differentiate them in vitro from DC in the presence and absence of VD3, and to mature them with LPS. Phenotype and cytokine levels were also analyzed in the culture supernatants. Dendritic cells were then co-cultured with naïve allogeneic CD4+ T cells and the frequencies of LTreg were determined (naïve-activated). Results: The results showed that unstimulated DC generated with VD3 kept the CD14. When activated with LPS, they expressed lower levels of C83, CD83 and CD86; HLA-DR; higher amounts of IL-1β, IL-8, IL-10, and tended to lessen IL-6, IL-12p70 and TGF-β1, compared to DCs not treated with VD3. The frequency of naïve LTreg was similar, although immature DC generated with VD3 tended to induce activated LTregs. Conclusion: Based on these results, it is possible to conclude that DCs generated with VD3 and treated with LPS presented a 'semi-mature' phenotype, and were able to secrete pro-inflammatory and anti-inflammatory cytokines. Besides, they did not increase their capacity to promote the polarization of naïve allogenic CD4+ T cells towards LTregs.",Article,"Munoz, Sindy M.; Rodriguez, Luz Stella",Cytokines;Dendritic cells;Lipopolysaccharides;T-lymphocytes,Cytokines;Dendritic cells;Lipopolysaccharides;T-lymphocytes,Colombia,WOS:000377253900010

Exposure to organic solvents (OS) and paints has been associated with genotoxicity and increased risk of neoplasms. However, the type of DNA damage induced for this exposure has not been yet fully characterized in humans. This knowledge would explain the mechanisms of genotoxicity caused by these compounds. Car painters in informal sector are a group highly exposed to OS and paints, due to inadequate practices of occupational safety. Objective. To identify the oxidative and methylating damage in the DNA of lymphocytes of car painters exposed to OS and paints. Materials and methods. Isolated peripheral blood lymphocytes from 62 painters and 62 unexposed subjects were analyzed by the high-throughput comet assay, coupled to the Fpg and AlkA enzymes. The categories of DNA damage evaluated were basal damage (without enzymes), oxidative and methylating damage. The parameter used to measure the damage was the percentage of DNA in tail (%TDNA). Results The %TDNA was higher in the exposed group compare to the unexposed (p < 0.05). In the exposed group, the %TDNA was higher in the oxidative damage category than the baseline (16.50 vs 12.87, p < 0.001), whereas the methylating damage did not show significant differences (14.00 vs 12.87; p > 0.05).

There are no no pharmacological measures for the prevention or treatment of this infection and, so far, it has caused more than 4'880.000 confirmed cases and 322.000 deaths. The different strategies for the control of the disease that have been proposed involve the participation of different actors. Such participation, guided by legal guidelines based on public health measures, include containment, mitigation, physical isolation, and quarantine. As this is a population- based problem, information plays a primary role; however, the many new terms hat have arisen and their misuse confuse and, therefore, misinform thus limiting citizen participation. For this reason, we conducted a review of the terms used in epidemics and pandemics of infectious diseases, particularly COVID-19. We considered and differentiated the relevant terms to facilitate the understanding of pathogen's behavior and epidemic and pandemic cycles, as well as the criteria for public health decision-making for the general public.

During 2007, the mortality due to road traffic accidents in children under the age of five was 11.7 per 100,000 in Colombia. Objective: To describe the trend of road traffic deaths in children under the age of five in Colombia from 2005 to 2009. Materials and methods: We conducted a cross-sectional study of death certificates in children under the age of five as registered in the official vital statistics records from 2005 to 2009 (ICD-10, codes V000-V999). We made a descriptive analysis, calculated mortality rates based on projections by the National Administrative Statistics Department and we established risk levels by provinces and municipalities (percentiles), as well as by conglomerates using Excel (R), PASW statistics18 (R) and Epilnfo (R) for the maps. Results: All in all, 713 road traffic deaths occurred from 2005 to 2009 in children under the age of five corresponding to 0.8% of total deaths in that age group. The total number of road traffic deaths decreased from 2005 (159 deaths) to 2009 (136 deaths). The mean national death rate due to road traffic accidents was 3.3 per 100,000 with a higher rate among one to four year-old children (3.5/100,000) compared to children under the age of one (2.6/100,000). The highest prevalence of road traffic deaths was observed in January (9.7%) and July (10.6%).

There are two strategies for its prevention: Universal prophylaxis, with valganciclovir for 90 days, and anticipated therapy, using weekly viral load surveillance, and therapy only if positive. Meta-analysis directly comparing both strategies have shown them to have similar effectiveness. Objective: To determine which strategy is more cost-effective in intermediate risk patients in Colombia. Materials and methods: We designed a third-party payer perspective decision tree, considering only direct medical costs in 2014 Colombian pesos (COP) (USD$ 1=COP$ 2,000) and a time horizon of one year. The target population was intermediate CMV risk patients (positive receptor). Transition probabilities were extracted from clinical studies, validated with a Delphi expert panel method; procedural costs were obtained from the ISS 2001 manual with a 33% increment based on the Consumer Price Index for 2014, while medication costs were obtained from the official Ministry of Health information system. Results: Universal prophylaxis with valganciclovir was dominant, with lower costs and less probability of infection. The average cost of the first year in anticipated therapy would be COP$ 30,961,290, whereas in the case of universal therapy the cost would be COP$ 29,967,834 (incremental cost of COP$ 993,456).

Objective: To determine antibiotic resistance in patients previously treated for H. pylori in Bogota-Colombia. Materials and methods: Descriptive study that include 10 isolates obtained from 5 patients with 3 or 4 previous failed treatments for H. pylori. Antibiotic resistance to amoxicillin, clarithromycin, levofloxacin and metronidazole was investigated by agar dilution. Antibiotic resistance was confirmed by DNA sequencing (Magrogen - Korea). Results: Eight isolates were resistant to two or more antibiotics. All isolates were resistant to levofloxacin. Susceptibility patterns in isolates from the antrum and body of the stomach were different in 3 patients. Conclusion: This is the first evidence of multiple H. pylori resistance in Colombia in patients previously treated for H. pylori.

The most frequent is Usher syndrome, a genetic disorder of autosomal recessive inheritance, and which in some cases, it is accompanied by vestibular dysfunction. However, there are cases of families, that despite having retinitis pigmentosa associated with deafness, cannot be classified in a specific syndrome, due to additional findings. Objective: Reassess the phenotypes of 103 families diagnosed previously, as possible Usher syndrome and / or RP associated with deafness. Materials and Methods: A descriptive, retrospective study was carried out. The medical records of 103 families with a probable clinical diagnosis of Usher Syndrome and / or RP associated with deafness were reviewed. Families whose clinical diagnosis did not correspond to a typical Usher syndrome were selected. Affected were evaluated at the ophthalmological and audiological level. Demographic and clinical variables were investigated. Results: 14 families, and 55 individuals in total, were selected and reevaluated, which did not correspond to a clinical diagnosis of Usher Syndrome. That is, 13.6% of the families that were initially considered typical Usher syndrome were later diagnosed with RP associated with deafness, another ocular symptom associated with hearing loss, RP or isolated hearing loss in the same family. Conclusions: Family study is essential in cases where the symptoms do not agree with a typical Usher syndrome.

In Colombia, despite having specific protocols for its notification, diagnosis, and management, there are still limitations in its control. Objectives: To describe the sociodemographic and clinical characteristics, as well as the spatial distribution of gestational syphilis in Cali, Colombia, in 2018. Materials and methods: We conducted a cross-sectional study of 427 gestational syphilis cases reported to the Colombian national epidemiological surveillance system (Sivigila). For the statistical processing, we used the R program, version 3.5.3. We expressed qualitative variables as proportions and quantitative ones through central tendency and dispersion measures, and to establish the spatial distribution we used the Qgis program, version 3.0. Results: The prevalence of gestational syphilis was 17 cases per 1,000 live births (including stillbirths); 57.1% of patients belonged to the subsidized healthcare system and 16.6% had no health insurance; 90.4% of cases were diagnosed during pregnancy; 47.2% of the pregnant women received three doses of penicillin, yet only 57.6% of contacts were treated. Conclusions: The prevalence of gestational syphilis in Cali during 2018 exceeded the national rate with a higher frequency among women in socioeconomic vulnerability conditions consistent with the general spatial distribution.

These chondrocytes synthesize glycosaminoglycans (GAGs), thus playing an important role in this process. A simplified system in vitro chondrogenesis, using adult mesenchymal stromal cells (MSCs) has been demonstrated. This differentiation potential is usually assessed by histological staining. Objective: Establishment of a semi-automatic grading system for histochemistry stains and immunohistochemistry assays. Materials and methods: For chondrogenesis cells were cultured for three weeks in aggregates with inducing media. Total GAGs were measured using dimethylmethylene blue (DMB) method. For histological analyses aggregates were stained with Alcian blue for total GAGs detection and immunohistochemistry (IHC) for aggrecan was performed. Semi-automatic grading for all slides was obtained after ImageJ analysis. Results: MSCs cultured as aggregates in chondrogenic differentiation media had similar protein concentrations for all time points, suggesting cellularity remained homogenous during culture. Total GAGs was higher for aggregates cultured in chondrogenic compared to complete media. The same trend was observed for Alcian blue stain grades by blinded observer and analysis using ImageJ software. Aggrecan's IHC analysis had a decreasing tendency with time for aggregates in chondrogenic media for blinded observer and ImageJ evaluation. Conclusion: We developed a functional system for semi-automatic slide grading. We corroborated these results by biochemical analysis with comparable results. To our knowledge, for in vitro chondrogenesis, this is the first report to evaluate stains using this methodology.

It is known that electroluminescence of these devices is strongly dependent on the material used as cathode and on the deposition parameters of the polymer electroluminescent layer MDMO-PPV. Objective. In this work the effect of i) the frequency of the spin coater (1000-8000 rpm), ii) the concentration of the MDMO-PPV: Toluene solution, and iii) the material used as cathode (Aluminium or Silver) on the electrical response of the devices, was evaluated through current-voltage (I-V) measurements. Materials and methods. PEDOT:PPS and MDMO-PPV organic layers were deposited by spin coating on ITO substrates, and the OLED structure was completed with cathodes of aluminium and silver. The electric response of the devices was evaluated based on the I-V characteristics. Results. Diodes prepared with thinner organic films allow higher currents at lower voltages; this can be achieved either by increasing the frequency of the spin coater or by using concentrations of MDMO-PPV: Toluene lower than 2% weight. A fit of the experimental data showed that the diodes have two contributions to the current. The first one is attributed to parasitic currents between anode and cathode, and the other one is a parallel current through the organic layer, in which the carrier injection mechanism is mediated by thermionic emission. Conclusions. The results of the fitting and the energy level alignment through the whole structure show that PPV-based OLEDs are unipolar devices, with current mainly attributed to hole transport.",Article,"Mendez, Henry.; Unknown.; Unknown.; Salcedo-Reyes, J.

For the first time it is investigated whether the Zoantharia Parazoanthus and Epizoanthus preference is related to the host sponge morphology (shape and mechanical resistance). Materials and methods: Sponges were categorized according to their shape and mechanical resistance. The presence/absence of zoanthids was recorded in 1,068 sponges at San Andres Island, and their habitat preference was evaluated using indices and confidence intervals. Results: 85 Parazoanthus colonies (78% of the total associations) and 24 Epizoanthus colonies (22%) were associated to sponges (10.2% in total). Parazoanthus uses branched and compressible sponges although prefers encrusting and fragile sponges, while Epizoanthus showes the opposite pattern, it can inhabit encrusting and fragile sponges but prefers branched and compressible sponges. Conclusion: These results indicated that sponge morphology is an important trait in zoanthid habitat selection. On the other hand, the similarity in the habitat used by zoanthids suggests the possibility of inter-generic competition if common resources are limited in time and space, while the differential habitat preference allows the competitive coexistence of both genera.",Article,"Montenegro, Javier A.; Acosta, Alberto",Epizoanthus;Host;Morphology;Parazoanthus;Sponge;Symbiont,Epizoanthus;Host;Morphology;Parazoanthus;Sponge;Symbiont,Colombia,

They are formed by a- and/or β-subunits encoded by HEXA and HEXB genes, respectively. Mutations in these genes lead to Tay Sachs or Sandhoff diseases, which are neurodegenerative disorders caused by the accumulation of non-degraded glycolipids. Although tissue-derived Hex have been widely characterized, limited information is available for recombinant β-hexosaminidases. In this study, human lysosomal recombinant Hex (rhHex-A, rhHex-B, and rhHex-S) were produced in the methylotrophic yeast Pichia pastoris GS115. The highest specific enzyme activities were 13,124 for rhHexA; 12,779 for rhHex-B; and 14,606 U .mg-1 for rhHex-S. These results were 25- to 50-fold higher than those obtained from normal human leukocytes. Proteins were purified and characterized at different pH and temperature conditions. All proteins were stable at acidic pH, and at 4 °C and 37 °C. At 45 °C rhHex-S was completely inactivated, while rhHex-A and rhHex-B showed high stability.

In this study, we assayed, in vitro and in vivo, the yeast Candida guilliermondii to determine its effectiveness as a biocontrol to reduce the rotting produced by Rhizopus stolonifer on tomatoes (Lycopersicon esculentum). The antagonistic effect was tested using a yeast biomass suspension; gas chromatography and a mass selective detector were used to identify its metabolites. According to the in vitro test, the only phase with an antagonistic response against Rhizopus stolonifer was the unfiltered water phase. In the in vivo tests, the biomass of Candida guilliermondii presented the highest percentage of protection of the tomato (87 %) compared with the unfiltered aqueous phase and the unconcentrated organic phase, which reached only 77 and 80 % respectively.

To isolate biosurfactant-producing microorganisms from the rhizosphere of fique and to select the best genus to evaluate the effect of nutritional and fermentation conditions on the production of rhamnolipids. Materials and methods. Rhizospheric soil was sampled in three areas of Cauca. The best genus was selected for the experimental designs (Plackett Burman and 22 factorial) and to find the production conditions for the growth kinetics at an Erlenmeyer flask scale. Results. Isolates from the rhizosphere of fique plants were from groups (or genera) of Bacillus, Pseudomonas and Actinomycetes, being Pseudomonas the more responsive in preliminary testing for emulsification. From the results of the experimental designs and the kinetics of production, we found that rhamnose synthesis associated with rhamnolipids (3.2 g/l) and emulsification (68% EC24) was significantly favored (p <0.0001) by cultivating an inoculum of 10% v/v of Pseudomonas fluorescens in a medium composed of: soybean oil 2% (v/v), K 2 HPO 4 0.2% (w/v), yeast extract 0.4 g/l, NH4 NO3 3.7 g/ l, 1 ml trace elements (CoCl3 20 mg/l, H3 BO3 30 mg/l, ZnSO4 10 mg/l, Cu2 SO4 1 mg/l, Na2 MoO4 3 mg/l, FeSO4 10 mg/l MnSO4 2,6 mg/ l) and pH 7.2.

The first grouping included buds, leaves, and nodes derived from juvenile basal offshoots and rejuvenated shoots from cuttings. The second, included leaves, petioles, nodes, internodes and nodes of in vitro elongated shoots. The highest organogenic potential was observed in nodes from juvenile trees: 45.8% of explants presented axillary bud elongation, while 56.2% presented rooting in a growth regulator free culture medium. Fiftyone percent of elongated shoots produced adventitious shoots with 0.5 μM NAA and 0.5 μM BA; 30% with 0.5 μM NAA and 1 μM BA; and 30% with 1 μM BA. Twenty percent presented roots with 0.5 μM NAA. Root formation was stimulated in a medium supplemented with activated charcoal (5 gL-1). The acclimatization of eighty percent of plantlets regenerated from nodes, and of 72.5% in vitro generated shoots was successful. On the contrary, mature trees material presented low organogenic response. Axillary bud elongation was recorded just in 10.7% of explants from juvenile shoots and in 6.7% of explants from rejuvenated shoots.

Thus, it is necessary to design and implement novel waste water treatment solutions. A sequential treatment consisting of ligninolytic co-culture with the fungi Pleurotus ostreatus and Phanerochaete crhysosporium (secondary treatment) coupled to TiO2/UV photocatalysis (tertiary treatment) was evaluated in the laboratory in order to discolor, detoxify, and reuse textile effluent waste water in subsequent textile dyeing cycles. After 48 h of secondary treatment, upto 80 % of the color in the waste water was removed and its chemical and biochemical oxygen demands (COD, and BOD5) were abated in 92 % and 76 %, respectively. Laccase and MnP activities were central to color removal and COD and BOD5 abatement, exhibiting activity values of 410 U.L-1 and 1 428 U.L-1, respectively. Subjecting waste water samples to 12h of tertiary treatment led to an 86 % color removal and 73 % and 86 % COD and BOD5 abatement, respectively. The application of a sequential treatment for 18 h improved the effectiveness of the waste water treatment, resultingin 89 % of color removal, along with 81 % and 89 % COD and BOD5 abatement, respectively. With this sequential treatment a bacterial inactivation of 55 % was observed. TiO2 films were reused continuously during two consecutive treatment cycles without thermic reactivation. Removal percentages greater than 50 % were attained. Acute toxicity tests performed with untreated waste water led to a lethality level of 100 % at 50 % in Hydra attenuata and to a growth inhibition of 54 % at 50 % in Lactuca sativa. Whereas sequentially treated waste water excreted a 13 % lethality at 6.25 % and aninhibition of 12 % at 75 % for H. attenuata and L. sativa, respectively.

Thanks to probiotic bacteria the symptoms of viral infections can be alleviated. Different mechanisms whereby probiotic bacteria exert they antiviral effect have been proposed. The aim of this study was to determine whether probiotic bacteria extracts bind to receptors of host cells susceptible of rotavirus (RV) infection. To accomplish this objective, four probiotic bacterial strains of Lactobacillus spp. and Bifidobacterium spp. were tested. Probiotic extracts were obtained after bacterial growth, cell lysis and centrifugation. Obtained probiotic extracts were used in assays to interfere with adhesion and penetration of a RV strain in the mammal cell line MA104. Furthermore, the interaction between probiotic extracts and MA104 cell receptors was evaluated by co-immunoprecipitation assays using anti-β3-integrins and anti-Hsc70 antibodies. All four probiotic, protein-rich, extracts reduced RV infections in MA104 cells, suggesting a successful antiviral activity mediated by these probiotic extracts. All probiotic extracts significantly exerted thir antiviral activity by interfering with RV adhesion on MA104 cell receptors, with proteins in probiotic extracts competitively interacting with cell surface receptors necessary to RV infection. Co-immunoprecipitation assay results showed that proteins in probiotic extracts were able to bind to β3-integrinsand Hsc70, which are two cellular receptors required to viral infection. The most significant contribution of this study is an insight into the mechanisms of probiotic antiviral activity, thus expanding current probiotics fundamental knowledge.",Article,"Unknown.; Unknown.; Fernandez, Karem.; Unknown.; Unknown.; Gutierrez, M.

Like other related biguanides, metformin displays antihyperglycemic properties, and has become the most widely prescribed oral antidiabetic medicine around the world. Intriguing recent evidence suggests that metformin has chemopreventive and direct antitumor properties, and several ongoing clinical studies around the world are using this agent alone or in combination with chemotherapeutic schemes to determine prospectively its safety and efficacy in the treatment of human cancer. Notably, immune activating effects of metformin have recently been described, and may support a notion put forth in the 1950s that this agent possessed antiviral and antimalarial effects. However, how these effects may contribute to its observed antitumor effects in retrospective studies has not been discussed. Mechanistically, metformin has been shown to activate liver kinase B1 (LKB1) and its downstream target AMP-activated kinase (AMPK). The activation of AMPK has been proposed to mediate metformin's glucose lowering effect, although recent evidence suggests that this agent can inhibit electron transport in hepatocyte mitochondria resulting in AMPK-independent inhibition of hepatic gluconeogenesis. Likewise, albeit activation of AMPK and the resulting inhibition of the mammalian target of rapamycin (mTOR) signaling have been suggested to mediate the antitumor effects of metformin, AMPK-independent growth inhibitory properties of this agent in tumor cells have also been described. Here we present a brief review of the signaling, metabolic, and immune effects of metformin and discuss how their interplay may orchestrate the antitumor effects of this agent.

Because most coral populations are self-feeding, a breakdown in recruitment would lead to local extinction. Recruitment indirectly affects both renewal and maintenance of existing and future coral communities, coral reef biodiversity (bottom-up effect) and therefore coral reef resilience. This process has been used as an indirect measure of individual reproductive success (fitness) and is the final stage of larval dispersal leading to population connectivity. As a result, recruitment has been proposed as an indicator of coral-reef health in marine protected areas, as well as a central aspect of the decision-making process concerning management and conservation. The creation of management plans to promote impact mitigation, rehabilitation and conservation of the Colombian coral reefs is a necessity that requires firstly, a review and integration of existing literature on scleractinian coral recruitment in Colombia and secondly, larger scale field studies.

To evaluate three treatments (facultative stabilization ponds, heterogeneous photocatalysis with TiO2 and chemical disinfection with sodium hypochlorite) for the inactivation of coliforms and Escherichia coli present in domestic wastewaters used in agricultural irrigation. Materials and methods. Wastewater was characterized by physical, chemical and microbiological analyses and was then exposed to a facultative pond treatment (FPT), post-photocatalytic treatment (PTFTiO2/UV) and post-chemical treatment (PTQNaClO) to assess the disinfecting capacity of each method in the inactivation of total coliforms and E. coli. Three new samples of wastewater were processed and used in irrigation tests on a laboratory-scale basis for 30 days, using Lactuca sativa cultivar. Batavia as a model plant and evaluating the initial and final concentrations of the two groups. Results. PTFTiO2/UV was significantly higher than FPT and PTQNaClO (p<0.0001), obtaining 100% of inactivation of coliforms and E. coli after 30 minutes of irradiation at a reactor scale. Regarding the irrigation tests with L. sativa, we showed that using water treated by PTFTiO2/UV there is no contamination with E. coli and coliforms after 30 days. On the contrary, plants irrigated with water treated by FPT and PTQNaClO showed an increase in the two populations originating a contamination problem in the vegetable by the end of the laboratory experiments.

We analysed samples of mtDNA from twenty (20) Native American populations (700 individuals) dispersed throughout Colombian territory. Samples were collected during 1989-1993 in the context of the program Expedición Humana (""Human Expedition"") and stored in the Biological Repository of the Institute of Human Genetics (IGH) at the Pontificia Universidad Javeriana (Bogotá, Colombia). Haplogroups were determined by analysis of RFLPs. Most frequent was haplogroup A, with 338 individuals (48.3%). Haplogroup A is also one of the most frequent haplogroups in Mesoamerica, and we interpret our finding as supporting models that propose Chibchan-speaking groups migrated to northern Colombia from Mesoamerica in prehistoric times. Haplogroup C was found in 199 individuals (28.4%), while less frequent were B and D, with 113 and 41 (16% and 6%) individuals, respectively. The haplogroups of nine (9) individuals (1.3%) could not be determined due to the low quality of the samples of DNA.

To isolate nitrogen fixing bacteria to be used in a fertilization regime of an organic agriculture program. Materials and methods. The isolation of nitrogen fixing bacteria was done in an Ashby-benzoate medium from soil of a Stevia rebaudiana plantation. Isolates identified as Azotobacter nigricans were evaluated by their growth kinetics and the strain with the fastest growth was used for the production of a biofertilizer by discontinuous fermentation. The preliminary evaluation of the biofertilizer was done by its inoculation into three ridges of a plantation of S. rebaudiana and yield determination was based upon biomass production and glycoside concentration. Results. Two isolates (A5 and A6) were identified as A. nigricans based on their phenotypic and genotypic characterization. Isolate A5 was selected for preparing the biofertilizer because it showed a better stability, pigmentation, a faster growth rate (0.1405 h-1 exponential phase of 18 hours) and an average IAA production of 38.4 mg/ml after 150 hours. The bio-fertilizer was obtained in milk medium with a cell concentration of 4x1012 CFU/ml. Conclusions.

Materials and methods: Phosphate-solubilizing bacteria were isolated from oil palm crop soil samples and selected on SMRS1 agar, which were then assessed with antagonism tests to verify their aptitude to form a co-culture. A Box-Behnken experimental design was applied to evaluate the effect of each one of the culture media components on the production of biomass and phosphatase enzymes at a laboratory scale. Finally, microbial growth and enzyme production curves were carried out in order to determine their production times. Results: Five phosphate-solubilizing bacterial strains were isolated and three of them were selected based on their solubilization indices. These Gram negative strains with bacillus morphology were identified as A, B and C; their solubilization indices were 2.03, 2.12, and 2.83, respectively. According to the ANOVA analyses for the Box-Behnken design, the only factor which had a significant effect on the phosphatase activity (p<0.01) was hydrolyzed yeast, and the formulation that generated the highest biomass concentration and phosphatase activity (p<0.01) contained 10, 15 and 2.5 gL(-1) of phosphoric rock, sucrose and hydrolyzed yeast, respectively.

However, seeds responses to light quality, in particular to short and mid-wavelengths, are not well known. We hypothesized that short wavelengths would have a positive effect on T. rosea germination. The effects of short, mid and long-wavelengths on germination capacity, rate (germination rate index, germination rate R<inf>50</inf>, a devised index of germination rate R<inf>50</inf> and peak value), mean daily germination and germination value were evaluated. Light quality had little effect on germination capacity; it was reduced only in darkness. Seeds under short and mid-wavelengths germinated faster (germination rate) than under any other light treatments. We concluded that although T. rosea seeds respond to all light quality treatments, the short and mid-wavelengths are the cue for increasing germination speed.

To quantify the diet, we used the volumetric method. Similarities between the basins were determined using three multivariate analyzes: nonmetric multidimensional scaling, analysis of similarity and similarity percentages. In the end, we collected a total of 675 individuals during 600 minutes of capture effort. The abundance of this species in the Bogota river basin was significantly lower compared to that of the Suarez basin. The dietary composition, of autochthonous origin, primarily immature insects and microcrustaceans and the volume of items proved similar between the basins. In conclusion, the dietary analysis indicated a similarity exceeding 60% in the feed resource use for the three basins.

In order to learn about the risk generated by these kinds of practices, we assessed the behavior of indicators of fecal contamination in grasses used to feed dairy cattle. The study area was divided into two plots: an experimental plot in which diluted biosolids were applied and a control plot without the application of biosolids. We collected samples from soil, grass, surface water and groundwater and analyzed the presence of fecal coliforms, Salmonella spp., somatic phages and helminth eggs. Experimental and control plots showed a decrease in the concentration of bacterial indicators assessed in soil, and low concentrations in surface water, groundwater and grass.

Using molecular simulation, we studied the influence of Mg2+ ions on the binding mode of HTLV-I Integrase (IN) catalytic domain (modeled by homology) with the 3,5- Dicaffeoylquinic Acid (DCQA). HTLV-I Integrase homology model was built using template-like crystallographic data of the IN catalytic domain solved for Avian Sarcoma Virus (VSA, pdb: 1VSD). Materials and methods. In order to analyze the role of Mg2+ in the interaction or coupling between 3,5-DCQA and Integrase, three models were created: i) in the absence of Mg2+ ions, ii) with a Mg2+ ion coordinated at Asp15 and Asp72 and iii) model with two Mg2+ ions coordinated at Asp15-Asp72 and Asp72-Glu108. Coupling force and binding free energy between 3,5-DCQA and HTLV-I IN were assessed in the three models. Results. The lowest docking score and free energy binding were obtained for the second model. Mg2+ ion strongly affected the coupling of the inhibitor 3,5-DCQA with HTLV-I catalytic domain of Integrase, thus revealing a strong interaction in the ligand-protein complex regardless of the ligand-catalytic interaction sites for all three models. Conclusion. Altogether, these results strengthen the hypothesis that the presence of one Mg2+ ion could enhance the interaction in the complex by decreasing free energy, therefore increasing the affinity.

Tools of this kind are called performance indicators, and their quality depends on the useful criteria they provide to evaluate the suitability of different candidate solutions to a given MOP. We present here a purely theoretical study of the compliance of the Δ p -indicator to the notion of Pareto optimality. Since Δ p is defined in terms of a modified version of other well- known indicators, namely the generational distance GD p , and the inverted generational distance IGD p , specific criteria for the Pareto compliance of each one of them is discussed in detail. In doing so, we review some previously available knowledge on the behavior of these indicators, correcting inaccuracies found in the literature, and establish new and more general results, including detailed proofs and examples of illustrative situations.",Article,"Vargas, Andres",Averaged Hausdorff distance;Distancia generacional;Distancia generacional invertida;Distancia promedio de Hausdorff;Distância geraçional;Distância geraçional invertida;Distância média de Hausdorff;Generational distance;Indicador de desempenho;Indicador de desempeño;Inverted generational distance;Multiobjective optimization;Optimalidad de Pareto;Optimización multiobjetivo;Otimalidade de Pareto;Otimização multiobjetivo;Pareto optimality;Performance indicator,Averaged Hausdorff distance;Distancia generacional;Distancia generacional invertida;Distancia promedio de Hausdorff;Distância geraçional;Distância geraçional invertida;Distância média de Hausdorff;Generational distance;Indicador de desempenho;Indicador de desempeño;Inverted generational distance;Multiobjective optimization;Optimalidad de Pareto;Optimización multiobjetivo;Otimalidade de Pareto;Otimização multiobjetivo;Pareto optimality;Performance indicator,Colombia,

To assess the relationship between structure and diet of the fish community and the riparian vegetation cover (RVC), in two hydrological periods (HYPE) in streams of the La Vieja river basin. Materials and methods. Collections were done with electrofishing and rapiché in March and May 2010. Efficiency of sampling effort was assessed with the estimator Chao2. Structure was analyzed using the indices of richness, dominance, diversity and evenness which were compared with an ANOVA. Gastrointestinal contents were analysed with the indices of vacuity coefficient, frequency, volume and food importance. We examined the relationship among diet, HYPE and RVC using the multiple correlation coefficient ®, the coefficient of determination (r2) and a Canonical Correspondence Analysis (CCA). Results. According to the Chao2 estimator, in most streams the fish species richness values are representative. There were no significant differences (P>0.05) among the structural variables, the HYPE and the RVC. According to r and r2 the diet of most fish species did not vary as a function of RVC and HYPE; however, according to the CCA diet varies as a function of HYPE but not of RVC. Conclusions. The fish community structure did not show changes according to RVC and HYPE. Although most species showed no changes in their diet, the community did show changes in diet according to HYPE, due to a change in composition; however diet changes were not detected by RVC.",Article,"Perez-Mayorga, Maria Angelica.; Prada-Pedreros, Saul",Coffee-growing region;Diet;Fish community;Hydrological period;Riparian vegetation cover;Structure,Coffee-growing region;Diet;Fish community;Hydrological period;Riparian vegetation cover;Structure,Colombia,

RSM results revealed that yeast extract and agitation were key culture factors that increased the growth-associated lipolytic activity by 4.5-fold (from 0.13 U.mg-1 to 0.6 U.mg-1). The 505 LIP lipase was partially purified using size-exclusion chromatography and ion-exchange chromatography. Its molecular weight was >77 kDa. The enzyme shows its optimum catalytic activity at 55 °C and pH 7.5. EDTA, PMSF, 1-butanol and DMSO inhibited enzymatic activity, whereas Tween 20, acetone, glycerol and methanol increased it. Metallic ions are not required for the activity of 505 LIP, and even have an inhibitory effect on the enzyme. This study shows the potential use of A. facilis strain USBA-GBX-505 for the production of a newly identified lipolytic enzyme, 505 LIP, which is stable at moderate temperatures and in the presence of organic solvents.

However, none of these evaluates the biological effect that can be generated in ecosystems or humans. In order to define the most suitable organisms to evaluate the toxicity in the affluent and effluent of three drinking-water treatment plants, five acute toxicity bioassays were used, incorporating three taxonomic groups of the food chain. Materials and methods: The bioassays used were Daphnia magna and Hydra attenuata as animal models, Lactuca sativa and Pseudokirchneriella subcapitata as plant models, and Photobacterium leioghnathi as bacterial model. To meet this objective, selection criteria of the organisms evaluated and cluster analysis were used to identify the most sensitive in the affluent and effluent of each plant. Results: All organisms are potentially useful in the assessment of water quality by meeting four essential requirements and 17 desirable requirements equivalent to 100% acceptability, except P. leioghnathi which does not meet two essential requirements that are the IC50for the toxic reference and the confidence interval. The animal, plant and bacterial models showed different levels of sensitivity at the entrance and exit of the water treatment systems.

Soil macrofauna act as indicators of ecosystem successional processes, and may have an important role in ecological restoration processes after clear cutting exotic tree plantations. The aim of the present study was to understand how soil macrofaunal assemblies change in areas with different ages post clear cutting of Pinus patula, and to identify the soil physico-chemical variables that better explain these variations. The macrofauna in a high montane forest was evaluated along with that of three areas with different ages post clearcutting: 0, 2.5, and 5 years after clearcutting (Yac). The effect of soil physico chemical variables on macrofauna abundance was also evaluated. Macrofauna composition changed after clearcutting. Macrofauna abundance, richness, and diversity were lower in the 0 Yac area than in the other areas. Moreover, the macrofuna similarity to the reference forest did not increase with the years after clearcutting. This is due to the changes in soil characteristics, triggered by clearcutting. Slope, temperature, bulk density, real density, loam, pH, P, Na and K were the soil variales with a positive effect on the macrofauna abundance. These physico-chemical variables should be considered when designing restoration plans for Andean forest ecosystems. Moreover, Diplopoda, Coleoptera and Chilopoda might be useful to monitor and evaluate restoration processes after Pinus spp. clearcutting, because of their high abundance, diversity and relationship with environmental conditions.",Article,"Tulande-M.; Esteban.; Barrera-Catano, Jose I.; Unknown.; Unknown.; Basto, Sofia",Andes;Restorationecology;Soil macrofauna;Tropicalmontaneforest,Andes;Restorationecology;Soil macrofauna;Tropicalmontaneforest,Colombia;Colombia,

In Colombia, chemical insecticides are used to manage the pest; however, because its management is not integrated, information about pest management in spinach is still undetermined. Here, we evaluated the susceptibility of D. platura to seven species of entomopathogenic nematodes from the central Andean region of Colombia. Additionally, under laboratory conditions, we produced and evaluated different doses of infective juveniles (IJs) of the most virulent species. In the laboratory, we used yellow potatoes (Solanum phureja) for breeding to obtain third instar larvae; we then exposed them to infective IJs 2500/species. Once we selected the most virulent species, we exposed D. platura to 500, 1000, 2000, 4000 and 8000 IJs/ larvae. We obtained the best results with Steinernema sp.3 with mortality of 75-88% at doses of 4000-8000 IJs, and found that DL50 is 1314 JIs/larvae and DL95 is 15259 JIs/larva. We also evidenced the successful reproduction of Steinernema sp.3 in D. platura, with a mean production of 670±7.67 JIs/larvae for eighteen days.

It appears to be caused by abnormal development of placental vasculature. Haemostatic processes are important for the development of the placenta, and an imbalance between procoagulant and anticoagulant factors has been associated with risk of intrauterine growth restriction. Objective: To evaluate coagulation abnormalities in placenta of pregnancies complicated with idiopathic intrauterine growth restriction. Materials and methods: Five placentas from pregnancies with idiopathic intrauterine growth restriction were compared to 19 controls. We performed gross and histological examination of the placenta. Analysis was made of both mRNA expression by real-time PCR and protein by ELISA of tissue factor and thrombomodulin in placental tissue. Results: Results based on histological evaluation were consistent with an increased prothrombotic state in placentas from pregnancies with idiopathic intrauterine growth restriction, and thrombosis of chorionic vessels was the most important finding. The study showed an increased expression of tissue factor protein (p=0.0411) and an increase in the ratio of tissue factor/thrombomodulin mRNA (p=0.0411) and protein (p=0.0215) in placentas from pregnancies with idiopathic intrauterine growth restriction. There were no statistically significant differences neither between cases and controls in the mRNA levels of tissue factor or thrombomodulin nor at the protein level of thrombomodulin.

The pre-mRNA derived from the LYT1 gene of Trypanosoma cruzi, is processed by alternative trans-splicing, resulting in different mRNAs which code for the isoforms mLYT1 and kLYT1, proteins having differential expression, cellular location and function. The aim of this study was to characterize the 5' and 3' UTRs of the LYT1 mRNAs as the initial step towards the objective of identification of the RBPs responsible for their differential expression. The presence of the two types of 5' UTRs were confirmed in two T. cruzi isolates belonging to the DTU I, thus, corroborating the occurrence of alternative trans-splicing also in the LYT1 gene of this T.cruzi DTU. In addition, for the first time, was unscovered the existence of two types of LYT1 mRNAs transcripts, differing in length by 116 nts, that are generated by alternative polyadenylation. Furthermore, an in-silico analysis of the experimentally obtained UTRs, and ten additional LYT1 sequences retrieved from TritrypDB and GenBank databases, together with a thoroughly search of structural motifs, showed a remarkable conservation of relevant structural motifs previously associated with RNA metabolism in the different UTRs; these elements might be involved in the differential stage-specific expression of each LYT1 isoform.",Article,"Marvez, Elizabeth Ruiz.; Ramirez, Cesar.; Unknown.; Unknown.; Unknown.; Puerta, C.",Gen LYT1;Gene LYT1;LYT1 gene;Proteínas de união de RNA [RBP];Proteínas de unión de ARN [RBP];Região não-traduzida [UTR];Región no traducida [UTR];Regulación de la expresión génica;Regulationofgeneexpression;Regulação da expressão génica;RNAbinding proteins [RBP];Trypanosoma cruzi;Trypanosoma cruzi;Trypanosomacruzi;Untranslatedregion [UTR],Gen LYT1;Gene LYT1;LYT1 gene;Proteínas de união de RNA [RBP];Proteínas de unión de ARN [RBP];Região não-traduzida [UTR];Región no traducida [UTR];Regulación de la expresión génica;Regulationofgeneexpression;Regulação da expressão génica;RNAbinding proteins [RBP];Trypanosoma cruzi;Trypanosomacruzi;Untranslatedregion [UTR],Colombia;Spain,

Materials and methods: Searches for maxicircle sequences were performed in the unassembled sequences of GeneDB database version 2.1, as well as in the GenBank, using the ND8 and RPS12 genes of L. braziliensis as the initial probes. These sequences were assembled and compared with the homologous sequences of trypanosomatids using the bioinformatics tools LALIGN and ClustalW2. The size of maxicircle was determined by Southern blot assays. Results: Two maxicircle fragments of 6535 and 4257 nucleotides were assembled. The sequences of these genes showed high synteny and similarity with the sequences in other Leishmania species. This similarity even was extended to the editing patterns of these molecules. Conclusions: Although L. braziliensis is the most divergent species of the Leishmania genus in their nuclear genome, the maxicicircle has a high conservation.

From June to December of 2011, a self-administered questionnaire was given to 404 breast cancer patients receiving outpatient therapy at the Javeriana Oncology Center of the Hospital Universitario San Ignacio in Bogotá. The prevalence of patient CAM use was 57%, out of which 76% was based on plants like anamú, aloe, red fruits and soursop. Sixty-five percent of the patients had a positive perception of using medicinal plants and 57% used them simultaneously with the oncologist recommended allopathic treatment. We concluded that the frequency of CAM use in breast cancer patients at the Javeriana Oncology Center is within the prevalence range reported worldwide, despite differences in CAM types and frequencies. The high rates of plant-based CAM use without physician consent, brings about the lack of assessment of the synergic or antagonistic effects of CAM therapies on the allopathic treatment of breast cancer and evaluation of the antitumor and immunomodulatory potential of the traditionally used plants.",Article,"Unknown.; Torregrosa, Lilian.; Unknown.; Mercado, Marcela.; Fiorentino, Susana",Anamú and soursop;Breast cancer;Complementary and alternative medicine;Plant-based therapy,Anamú and soursop;Breast cancer;Complementary and alternative medicine;Plant-based therapy,Colombia;Colombia,

Materials and methods: We performed a computational analysis of the primary structure of LIC10494 using the servers BLAST, PROTPARAM, PROTSCALE, DAS, SOSUI, TOPPRED, TMAP, TMpred, SPLIT4, PHDHTM, TMHMM2, HMMTOP2, GLOBPLOT and PROSITE. The secondary structure was obtained by consensus of the algorithms SOPM, PREDATOR GOR4, DPM and DSC. The approach to the tertiary structure was obtained using the algorithm MUSTER. The energy minimization was done using the AMBER94 force field of the Schrodinger suite of molecular analysis, and the stereochemistry and energy model validation was performed by the RAMPAGE server. The final model was visualized using PyMol V.0,98. Results. This study proposes a computational model that describes the 3D structure of the hypothetical lipoprotein LIC10494 and agrees with previous experimental reports; thus, our study demonstrates the existence of patterns that could play an important role in the pathogenicity and protection of the bacteria against the host immune system; the presence of a disorganized region between amino acids 80 and 140, and of a transmembrane segment between amino acids 8 and 22.

This substrate is absorbed by the astrocytes and hydrolyzed via aspartoacylase II (ASPA; EC 3.5.1.15) in acetate and aspartate. We propose that the aspartate may help in fulfilling the astrocyte metabolic requirements during the presuckling period. Objectives. To evaluate the astrocyte ability to use the aspartate as a metabolic substrate in perinatal physiological conditions, and to determine whether the aspartate utilization can be modified by changes in the concentration of glucose (Glc), lactate (LAC) and N-acetyl-L-aspartate (NAA) and whether these variations in concentration can regulate the enzymatic activity of the ASPA. Materials and methods. Quiescent cultures of neonatal astrocytes of Wistar rat were incubated with L-aspartate (0.5 mM) and L-[U-14C]-aspartate (2 μCi), to assess their ability to use them as oxidative and lipogenic substrates. The effect of varying concentrations of Lac, Glc and NAA on the use of aspartate (radiometry method) and the ASPA activity (spectrophotometry method) was evaluated in both presuckling and adult physiological conditions. Results. Astrocytes are able to use aspartate 87 times more as an oxidative substrate than a lipogenic substrate. Conclusions. The use of aspartate and its destiny are affected significantly (p<0.05) by the concentrations of Lac, Glc and NAA.

Objective: To estimate the anaplerotic capacity of neurons and astrocytes grown in vitro under perinatal conditions. Materials and methods: The effect of 3-nitropropionate (3-NPA)(2 mM) an inhibitor of the succinate dehydrogenase (SDH) on the oxidative and lipogenic metabolism of 14C-derived from acetate and lactate in perinatal concentrations. The results were compared with its respective controls without inhibitor. Results: In spite of the presence of 3-NPA, respiratory activity with lactate was 40% in neurons and 73% in astrocytes, the lipogenesis was 53% in neurons and 52% in astrocytes. With acetate, the oxidation in neurons was 15% and 63% in astrocytes, lipogenesis was maintained in astrocytes but in neurons it increased up to 174% (p<0.05). Conclusions: These results demonstrate that in spite the oxalacetate depletion generated by 3-NPA, neurons as well as astrocytes are able to maintain the energetic metabolism and the lipid synthesis using lactate or acetate thanks to the anaplerotic activity in the presuckling period. Additionally, astrocytes showed a capacity of buffering the effects of 3-NPA on the oxidation process greater than the neuron capacity.

In Andean high montane areas, after Pinus patula clearcutting, changes in soil pH and litter lead to increased fauna and flora biodiversity. However, the impact of these changes on seed banks remains unknown. The aims of the present study were to understand how seed bank richness, abundance, and composition changes after P. patula clearcutting, and to identify the role of aboveground cover, pH and litter cover on these seed bank variations. The study was conducted in three areas with different post-clearcutting ages (0, 2.5, 4.5 years), a P. patula plantation and in a high Andean forest patch. All these sites were located between 3 033 and 3 100 m.a.s.l. Seed bank abundance, richness and the number of seeds of the ten most abundant species increased in areas with 2.5 and 4.5 years after clearcutting. Moreover, seed bank composition was different among study areas. These changes were related to increasing aboveground vegetation cover and soil pH, and to decreasing litter cover. Seed banks contributed almost exclusively to the recovery of some herbaceous species; we recorded only one tree species recruit from the seed banks (Baccharis latifolia) in the forest soils; therefore, the natural regeneration processes may be constrained.

PNW was implemented in the CHARMM program using an integration time step of 1 fs and a uniform dielectric constant of 1. The ubiquitin molecule, initially solvated, was put under mechanical stress, exerting forces from different directions. The rupture of five hydrogen bonds between parallel strands β1 and β5 takes place during the extension from 13 to 15 Å, defines a mechanical barrier for unfolding and dominates the point of maximum unfolding force. The simulations described here show that given adequate time, a small applied force can destabilize those five H-bonds relative to the bonds that can be created to water molecules; allowing the formation of stable H-bonds between a single water molecule and the donor and acceptor groups of the interstrand H-bonds. Thus, simulations run with PNW show that the force is not responsible for ""ripping apart"" the backbone H-bonds; it merely destabilizes them making them less stable than the H-bonds they can make with water. Additional simulations show that the force necessary to destabilize the H-bonds and allow them to be replaced by H-bonds to water molecules depends strongly on the pulling direction. By using a simulation protocol that allows equilibration at each extension we have been able to observe the details of the events leading to the unfolding of ubiquitin by mechanical force.",Article,"Pabon, German.; Unknown",H-bond;Mechanical unfolding;Molecular dynamics;PNW,H-bond;Mechanical unfolding;Molecular dynamics;PNW,Colombia;United States,

These three bacteria are responsible for foodborne diseases. Routine microbiological methods to detect these microorganisms in cow milk can be complicated and time consuming. The aim of this work was to evaluate a method to simultaneously detect Salmonella spp., Escherichia coli O157:H7, and Listeria monocytogenes in experimentally contaminated cow milk. The assessed method combined a standard microbiological culture step, using a pre-enrichment medium that favors the growth of the three focal microorganisms: SEL broth, followed by a single PCR assay. A total of 43 interference bacterial strains were used to evaluate the method's specificity. The detection rate for the microbiological method with standard culture media was 10 UFC/mL, and that of the PCR detection, following pre-enrichment in SEL broth, was 10 UFC/mL for S. enterica and L. monocytogenes and between 1 and 5 UFC/mL for E. coli O157:H7. The PCR method showed specificity for the reference strains. Simultaneous detection by multiple PCR using SEL broth was successful for the detection of S. enterica, E. coli O157:H7, and L. monocytogenes in samples of experimentally contaminated cow milk, featuring both a high detection rate and a high specificity.

Materials and methods: We identified 91 sequences for NMDA, AMPA and kainate receptors and analyzed with software for predicting secondary structure, phosphorylation sites, multiple alignments, selection of protein evolution models and phylogenetic prediction. Results: We found that subunits GLUR5, NR2A, NR2C and NR3A showed structural changes in the C-terminal region and formation or loss of phosphorylation sites in this zone. Additionally the phylogenetic prediction suggests that the NMDA NR2 subunits are the closest to the ancestral node that gives rise to the other subunits. Conclusions. Changes in structure and phosphorylation sites in GLUR5, NR2A, NR2C and NR3A subunits suggest variations in the interaction of the C-terminal region with kinase proteins and with proteins with PDZ domains, which could affect the trafficking and anchoring of the subunits. On the other hand, the phylogenetic prediction suggests that the changes that occurred in the NR2 subunits gave rise to the other subunits of glutamate ionotropic receptors, primarily because the NMDA and particularly the NR2D subunits are the most closely related to the ancestral node that possibly gave rise to the iGluRs.",Article,"Unknown.; Lareo, Leonardo.; Reyes-Montano, Edgar A.",AMPA;GluR5;Glutamate ionotropic receptors;iGluRs;NMDA;NR1;NR2A;NR2C;NR3A,AMPA;GluR5;Glutamate ionotropic receptors;iGluRs;NMDA;NR1;NR2A;NR2C;NR3A,Colombia;Colombia,

Materials and methods: A survey asking about sausage cooking habits was completed with 50 housewives. We analyzed 60 samples of sausages previously inoculated with 103 CFU g-1 from a pool of 5 strains of L. monocytogenes, then the cooking procedures described in the survey were applied to the samples, and counting was done immediately after. Additionally, a complementary test was carried out by inoculating 20 samples of sausages with 103 CFU g-1 and exposing them to 72 °C and 73 °C for 30 seg. Results: The survey showed that 15 minute boiling and 5 minute frying are the most frequent ways of preparing sausages by consumers. We established that the time and cooking conditions used in our assay had a statistically significant effect (p: 0.016) on the inoculated samples. In the complementary assay, statistical data (p: 0.0001) indicated that internal temperatures of 73 °C are enough to inactivate the pathogen at an industrial scale.

Materials and methods: Free radicals produced by ionizing radiation in alanine are detected by electron spin resonance (ESR); paraffin is used as binder. The methodology of preparation includes: elaboration, irradiation, data collection and data analysis for the two types of dosimeters. The ESR spectra studied correspond to alanine dosimeters with masses between 60 and 120 mg and irradiated with doses of 10 and 20 Gy, and alanine/paraffin dosimeters with 160 mg and irradiated with different doses in a beam of photons 4 MV. Results: The intensity of the spectra (the characteristic five lines) depends on the doses received by the dosimeters and their relationship is linear. With pure alanine and a dose of 10 Gy, the minimum amount required was 120 mg; the achieved cylinder compaction was not sufficient to avoid the partial fragmentation of the dosimeter. Paraffin has no paramagnetic signal; in the alanine/paraffin dosimeters (cylinders of 13 mm in length and 3.5 mm of diameter, with a ratio 80:20, and good hardness) the response signal ESR-dose was studied in a range between 20 and 120 Gy.

To find the optimum concentration of commercial α- and β-amylase for the obtainment of ethanol from unmalted barley. Materials and methods. Unmalted barley was hydrolyzed using various concentrations of commercial α- and β-amylase (Genencor International), following conditions established by the manufacturer. The products of hydrolysis were used as substrates for the production of ethanol by Saccharomyces cerevisiae. In addition, a reference assay was performed using malted barley following the conditions established by the distillery. Results. The percentage of starch hydrolysis was 89.4% when adding α-and β-amylase at a concentration of 1 g L-1. Moreover, this concentration of amylases yielded a maximum ethanol production (5.02 %) significantly higher than when malted barley was used (3.76 %). Conclusions. It was demonstrated that ethanol can be obtained from starch of unmalted barley by adding commercial α- and β-amylase.

These regulatory signals are generated upon activation of receptors on T cells that include CD160, 2B4, Programmed Death-1 and CTLA-4. Objective. To evaluate the expression of inhibitory receptors like CD160, 2B4, Programmed Death-1 and CTLA- 4 on CD4+ and CD8+ T cells from healthy Colombian donors. Materials and methods. Peripheral blood mononuclear cells from 30 healthy donors from Bogotá (Colombia) were obtained via Ficoll-Hypaque density gradient and cells were stained with specific conjugated antibodies previously titrated. Results. The CD160, 2B4, and Programmed Death-1 inhibitory markers were detected on CD4+ T cells with expression levels of 0.35%, 1.04%, and 1.35%, respectively. On CD8+ T cells, these markers were expressed at higher levels: 16%, 8.97%, and 4.3%, respectively. In contrast to the other receptors, CTLA-4 frequency of expression showed no significant difference between CD4+ (1.56%) and CD8+ (1.53%) T cells. Frequency of CD160/2B4 and CTLA-4/ Programmed Death-1 coexpression was 0.18% and 0.09% on CD4+ cells, and 4.02% and 0.2% on CD8+ T cells. Conclusions. This is the first report showing the frequency of inhibitory receptors such as CD160, 2B4, Programmed Death-1, and CTLA-4 on CD4+ and CD8+ T cells from healthy Colombian donors.

Additionally, the development and evolution of the brain respond underlying genetic processes. Objective: To present an approach to the evolutionary process of the iGluR with the maximum likelihood (ML) and Bayesian (By) phylogenetic analysis methods. Materials and methods: we used in silico methods to propose a model of molecular evolution and to do a qualitative recognition of synteny blocks for these genes in different species of primates (chimpanzee, orangutan, rhesus monkey and man). Results: Glutamate is the main neurotransmitter and plays an important role in neuronal plasticity and neurotoxicity. Neurotransmission via glutamate is mediated by ionotropic glutamate receptors (iGluR) NMDA type and non-NMDA type (AMPA and KA). For every phylogenetic inference, we confirmed that the iGluRs of mammals could have evolved from a primitive signaling mechanism, thus explaining similar clusters between some species of primates and rodents. Conclusion. The NR-2 sequences have been exposed to a purifying selection, and the neutral level of divergence is faster in primates than in rodents, however further studies are needed to confirm these theories of evolution.",Article,"Unknown.; Reyes-Montano, Edgar A.; Lareo, Leonardo",AMPA;Evolution in gene families;Iglur;KA;NMDA;Phylogenetic inference of ML and By,AMPA;Evolution in gene families;Iglur;KA;NMDA;Phylogenetic inference of ML and By,Colombia;Colombia,

This phenomenon persists until it is destroyed by the late autolytic processes of decomposition, after 36 hours postmortem. Objective: To analyze the feasibility of accelerating the reversion of the mandibular cadaverous stiffness by means of chemical substances to facilitate the buccal opening. Materials and methods: We assessed substances capable of altering the pH, chelating intramuscular calcium or inducing proteolysis of the actin-myosin complex of the masticatory muscles with cadaverous stiffness in Wistar rats. Results: We found that mandibular cadaverous stiffness in Wistar rats appears after 2.5 hours of death. After 3.5 hours, once the rigidity was established, we carried out infiltrations with EDTA (20 mM), NaHCO3 (50 μM), Na2CO3 (50 μM) and papain (10 μM). NaHCO3 and Na2CO3 solutions significantly increased (p<0.05) the reversion speed (mm/h) from hour 5, in 108% and 100%, respectively. Based on the results of this assay, we doubled the concentration of NaHCO3 and assessed a 1:1 mixture of NaHCO3 and Na2CO3 without finding significant differences with the NaHCO3 and Na2CO3 prior assays.

Materials and methods: We analyzed biopsies from 28 patients diagnosed with DLBCL. The expression of the apoptotic regulators was assessed by western blot. The association between protein expression and survival was analyzed by the Kaplan-Meier method and the log-rank test. Results: Bcl-2, Bak, Bad and Bcl-xL proteins were expressed in 78.8, 71.4, 64.3 and 50% of the DLBCL cases, respectively. We found no association between the presence of proteins or their expression levels and overall survival. Both Bad and Bcl-xL were associated with higher disease-free survival (33.3% vs. 20.0%, p LR test= 0,003; 42.9% vs. 14.3%, p LR test= 0.03, respectively).

Subunit NR1 iGluRs-NMDA is of paramount importance for the appropriate activation of this type of receptors; in fact, many of the pharmaceutical products studied for the abovementioned disorders are targeted specifically to the NR1 subunit. Previous studies have shown that the lowest energy unoccupied molecular orbital (LUMO) can be used as a parameter to estimate the agonist and antagonist activity of the NR1subunit.

As there is an increased risk of vulnerability, their problems and mental disorders need to be assessed in order to determine specific treatments. Objectives To determine the prevalence of problems and mental disorders in those internally displaced by the conflict. Methods Data was obtained from the National Mental Health Survey 2015. The diagnostic tools used were the composite international diagnosis interview (CIDI-CAPI), Self-reporting questionnaire (SQR). Alcohol consumption was assessed with the Alcohol Use Disorders Identification test (AUDIT). A survey based on the Alcohol, Smoking and Substance Involvement Screening Test (ASSIST) was developed. The modified Post-traumatic Stress Disorder (PTSD) Checklist-Civilian version (PCL-C) was used to determine possible post-traumatic stress Disorder. Multidimensional poverty index (MPI) and Family-Apgar questionnaire were applied to general individual and household data. Results A total of 943 persons displaced by the conflict were reported, with self-report of symptoms in 16.4% (95% CI, 13.2-20.1). The prevalence of any of the measured mental disorders (CIDI-CAPI) ever in life was 15.9% (95% CI, 11.9-21.1), with a suicidal ideation of 12.5% (95%CI, 9.0-17.1), and excessive alcohol consumption in 10.1% (95% CI, 7.2-13.9). More than one-third (35.6%, (95% CI, 30.7-40.8) of people report having experienced, witnessed, or been told that someone close had had a traumatic event related to the armed conflict. An increased risk of PTSD is reported by 3.6% (95% CI, 2.2-5.9) displaced people that had reported at least one traumatic event. Family dysfunction in the displaced population is absent (74.8% (95%.CI, 70.4-78.8).

Results from the 2015 National Mental Health Survey,"Introduction Suicidal behaviour leads to a significant cause of mortality in the world. It is important to know the factors associated with this behaviour in order to design public health policies that may decrease its incidence. Objective Describe the results of the Colombian National Survey of Mental Health related to suicidal behaviour in adults. Results It was observed that 5.5% (95% CI, 4.5-6.7) of men and 7.6% (95% CI, 6.6-8.7) of women had suicidal thoughts. A suicide plan was reported in 2.7% of women (95% CI, 2.1-3.0), and attempted suicide observed in 1.9% of men (95% CI, 1.4-2.5) and 3.3% of women (95% CI, 2.6-4.1). The region with the highest frequency of suicidal ideation was Bogotá, with 10.3% (95% CI, 7.6-13.8) and was the lowest in the Atlantic region with 3.8% (95% CI, 3.0-4.8). It was found that the presence of any mental illness, especially depressive, anxiety disorders and borderline personality traits, as well as people who have been displaced by violence at least once in life, are associated with serious suicidal ideation. No differences were found in suicidal ideation as regards poverty or problems arising from alcohol consumption. Conclusions Suicidal behaviour is common in the Colombian adult population, which warrants the design and implementation of interventions in the most vulnerable groups in order to reduce this risk.",Article,"Arenas, Alvaro.; Gomez-Restrepo, Carlos.; Unknown",Borderline personality disorder;Health surveys;Mental disorders;Suicidal ideation,Borderline personality disorder;Health surveys;Mental disorders;Suicidal ideation,Colombia,

Between 1985 and 2012 an estimated of 220,000 Colombians have died and about 6,000,000 have been displaced by violence. Objective To describe and compare the prevalence of some problems and mental disorders in the adult population in Colombia, taking into account the characteristics of the municipality, as regards its history of violence or armed conflict. Methods The results for adults (over 18 years) of some problems and mental disorders were taken from the ENSM-2015. The municipalities were classified according to the presence and intensity of the conflict using the classification proposed by the CERAC. Disorders were measured using CIDI-CAPI, and problems with AUDIT, modified PCL (Post-Traumatic Stress Disorder Checklist). An estimate was also made of psychoactive substances consumption. Results A total of 10,870 people were interviewed, of whom 5,429 had not changed residence. There was had permanent conflict in 21.8% of the municipalities, 65.5% had a discontinued conflict, and only 12.7% had been pacified or had no conflict. The intensity of the conflict was reported as high by 31.8% of the people. Violent municipalities have a higher prevalence of anxiety disorders, depression, possible Post-Traumatic Stress Disorder, and smoking. Alcohol consumption was more common in municipalities with less intense conflict.

It is essential to have an improved knowledge of the magnitude of this issue and to design timely interventions that reduce long term complications. Objective The aim of the study was to determine the prevalence of the disorders in the last 12 months and 30 days according to the DSM-IV, as well as to collect data about social and demographic variables. Methods The structured Diagnostic Interview Schedule for Children (DISC-P), which provides DSM-IV diagnoses, was applied to carers of non-institutionalised children between 7 and 11 years old. The disorders evaluated included: major depressive disorder, dysthymia, generalised anxiety disorder, separation anxiety disorder, attention deficit hyperactivity disorder in its three kinds (mixed, inattentive, and hyperactive), oppositional defiant disorder, and conduct disorder. The instrumentation was computer-assisted. Results Prevalences of the disorders are present both in the last 30 days and in the last 12 months. In general, there is a prevalence of any of the disorders of 3% (95% CI, 2.2-4.0) in the last 30 days, and 4.7% (95% CI, 3.6-6.2) in the last 12 months. When evaluated individually, attention deficit hyperactivity disorder is the most frequent disorder, with a prevalence of 2.3% and 3.0% in the last 30 days and the last 12 months, respectively. In addition, the disorders that are known to frequently begin during childhood are the most common disorders in the age group studied, with a prevalence of 2.5% in the last 30 days and 3.2% in the last year. Conclusions The 2015 National Mental Health Survey provides precise information about the real mental situation in children between the ages of 7 and 11 years in Colombia, compared with past epidemiological studies in the country, which were restricted to specific populations. By improving the reliability on knowledge about mental disorders in children, it will be possible to design more appropriate and precise strategies for prevention, diagnosis, and treatment.",Article,"Gomez-Restrepo, Carlos.; Unknown.; Tamayo Martinez, Nathalie.; Gil, Fabian.; Unknown.; Unknown",Adolescent;Child;Child psychiatry;Mental disorders;Mental health,Adolescent;Child;Child psychiatry;Mental disorders;Mental health,Colombia,

Objective To assess alcohol consumption in Colombia, taking into account sociodemographic and clinical screening categories included. Methods Secondary database analysis, sample size: 15,231 people from 13,200 households of five regions (Atlantic, Bogotá, Central, Eastern, and Pacific), with an age range from 12 to 96 years. AUDIT and AUDIT-C were used and stratified according to score and other variables included in the survey analysis. Results The high-risk drinking category was observed in 2.7% of children studied, with the highest percentage of drinking risk lying in the range of 18 to 44 years, with a clear majority of men. Conclusions The study finds that a positive AUDIT-C in adults is associated with a higher percentage of non-anxiety, less anxiety problems, and traumatic events and traumatic events related to armed conflict. This requires further studies. Adults with positive AUDIT-C have a greater perception of well-being, but also a higher percentage of households in poverty.

The poverty status was determined by the MPI. Results A total of 13,200 households were interviewed, of which 13.5% were classified as in a poverty condition, 6.3% of the adolescents of poor households reported a life-time prevalence of any mental disorder, and 4.6% in the last 12 months. On the other hand, the prevalences for the same age group not in a poverty condition were 7.2% and 3.3%, respectively. For adults in poverty, the prevalence of life-time mental disorders were 9.2%, with 4.3% in the last year, while those not considered poor showed prevalences of 9.1% and 3.9% for the same time periods.

They were evaluated using Zarit Caregiver Burden Inventory, Family Coping Strategies Questionnaire, Scale for the Assessment of Positive Symptoms, Scale for the Assessment of Negative Symptoms, and the brief Disability Assessment Scale. Results: Burden of illness positively associated with patient impairment in occupational and social functioning, and negatively with education level. Avoidance, coercion and positive communication were positively associated with impairment in occupational and social functioning of patients. Social interest and friendships showed a positive association with the education level of caregivers. Spiritual assistance negatively correlated with impairment in social functioning and patient age, and resignation was negatively associated with length of the disorder and patient education level. Conclusions: Burden and dysfunctional coping strategies, such as avoidance and coercion, are associated with functional impairment of the patient.

However, it is a relatively unexplored aspect in the Colombian population. It is important to identify the associated factors in order to develop appropriate treatment strategies. Objective To identify risk factors for suicidal ideation in patients with major depressive disorder between 18 and 65 years in 5 Colombian cities. Methods Data from 295 patients diagnosed with major depressive disorder were used from the Study of the Economic Burden of Depression in Colombia. The association between the clinical and psychosocial variables with the presence of suicidal ideation was assessed using two-level hierarchical models. Results Female sex was a factor associated with a lower risk of suicidal ideation. Factors associated with the presence of suicidal ideation include unemployment, smoking and alcohol use in the past 30 days, mental health perceived as fair or poor, diagnosis of double depression, inpatient treatment, low income, unemployment, and a major financial crisis in the last 2 years. Conclusions Suicidal ideation is highly prevalent in patients with major depressive disorder.

Objectives To explore the presence of SA and NSSI in patients attending an outpatient ED program, as well as to evaluate the associated variables and the correlation between both types of behaviors. Materials and methods A total of 908 patients of both sexes attending the Equilibrio outpatient program in Bogotá were studied. The histories of SA and NSSI were systematically examined in the development of medical history by direct and structured questions to the patient, and then validated during interviews with the family. Sociodemographic and clinical variables, as well as history of traumatic experiences, were also studied. Simple frequencies were calculated, and a bivariate analysis was performed between SA, NSSI, and the other variables of the study. Finally, two models of association were designed for the multivariate analysis, using variables of clinical importance and statistical significance. Results SA sometime in their lives was reported by 13% of the patients, and 26% of them reported NSSI. The variables associated with SA were bipolar disorder (OR: 3.86, 95% CI; 2.4-6.1), borderline personality, purgative subtype of ED, and self-injury. Sexual abuse was associated with NSSI (OR: 3.48, 95%CI; 2.2-5.4), as well as bipolar disorder, trichotillomania, and suicide attempt. Conclusion SA and NSSI are frequent in patients with eating disorders with multiple comorbidities, increased impulsivity and emotional dysregulation, and they should be explored and treated. © 2013 Asociación Colombiana de Psiquiatría.

Disorders measured where mood disorders and anxiety social phobia, generalised anxiety disorder, and panic disorder in the past 12 months, and several chronic conditions. Univariate and bivariate analyses were performed for these conditions. Results The highest prevalence of mood and anxiety disorders were found in people with gastrointestinal diseases, followed by those with chronic pain, heart, and lung diseases, which corresponded to 27.1%, 13.3%, 12.2%, and 11.5%, respectively, in those between 18 and 44 years old, and 15.9%, 12.2%, 8.0%, and 7.4% of those 45 and older, respectively. This was greater than the prevalence of these mental disorders in people with no chronic condition, where the prevalence is 3.5% in the younger, and 1.1% in the older group. However, the risk of these mental disorders is higher in older people. Thus, in those with gastrointestinal diseases when compared to people of the same age without any chronic condition the prevalence is 14.9 times higher, but for the same disease in the younger group it is 7.8. Conclusions These findings link chronic conditions with a higher prevalence of mental disorders, which in the present study also highlights the greater comorbidity of mood and anxiety disorders in the elderly.",Article,"Tamayo Martinez, Nathalie.; Gomez-Restrepo, Carlos.; Ramirez, Sandra Milena.; Rodriguez, Nelcy",Anxiety disorders;Chronic disease;Gastrointestinal diseases;Mood disorders,Anxiety disorders;Chronic disease;Gastrointestinal diseases;Mood disorders,Colombia;Colombia,

Since the beginning, mental illness has been frequently linked to stigma and prejudice, which has important implications for the exercise of their human rights, including the right to health, as these preconceptions can delay their early detection and timely treatment. Eliminating stigma requires multiple interventions, in which the participation of people with these illnesses can be very helpful. Social networks portray an alternative for them and for people interested in this topic, helping them interact, clarify some concerns and doubts, and perhaps even modify their exclusion status. Method Describing the experience of the opinion and support group on Facebook called ""Aceptando mentes dementes"" (""Accepting Demented Minds""), created for people with mental illnesses, their families and any person interested in this matter, which seeks to make the impact and consequences that result from stigma more noticable. Analysis of qualitative and quantitative data collected over two and a half years of operation of the group, formed by 764 members from different countries. Results The aims of the group, as regards the spreading of information, interaction through shared experiences, and obtaining support were reached. Conclusions Social networks allow the creation of communities that share specific needs, such as understanding and support, and all this at low cost. Knowing and being conscious about the stigma linked to mental illness helps raise awareness and generate options for change.

It is estimated that around 10% of adolescents have mental disorders that require attention and are generally not recognised as such. The aim was to determine potential factors associated with whether or not mental disorders and problems are recognised in the Colombian population. Methods: Adolescents aged 12 to 17 who said they had been diagnosed with a mental health problem or disorder by a healthcare professional were identified from the National Mental Health Survey conducted in Colombia in 2015. This group was compared with those who scored positive for mental disorders measured by CIDI 3.0 or mental problems detected by SRQ-20. Results: A sample of 1,754 adolescents was obtained, of whom 7.3% (n = 129) had disorders and 22.6% (n = 396) had problems. Of the total with disorders and problems, 13.9% (n = 18) of people with disorders and 8.3% (n = 33) with problems knew they had them. Bivariate analyses were performed with the possible related variables, and with the results we constructed a multivariate regression model that identified factors associated with the recognition of disorders or problems, such as family dysfunction (OR = 2.5; 95% CI, 1.3-4.5) or counting on family when having financial problems (OR = 2.7; 95% CI, 1.0-7.2). Conclusions: Recognition is of great importance for initiating access to care by adolescents. The results provide associated variables which can aid planning of interventions to improve the detection of disorders and problems in this population.",Article,"Gomez-Restrepo, Carlos.; Malagon, Nelcy Rodriguez.; Eslava-Schmalbach, Javier.; Ruiz, Rafael E.; Gil, Fabian",Access;Adolescence;Mental disorders;Mental health;Recognition,Access;Adolescence;Mental disorders;Mental health;Recognition,Colombia;Colombia,

In Colombia, within this framework and promoted by the Ministry of Health and Social Protection, as well as being supported by Colciencias, the fourth National Mental Health Survey (NMHST) was conducted using a observational cross sectional study. According to the context and following the guidelines and sampling design, a summary of the methodology used for this sampling process is presented. The fourth NMHST used the Homes Master Sample for Studies in Health from the National System of Studies and Population Surveys for Health to calculate its sample. This Master Sample was developed and implemented in the year 2013 by the Ministry of Social Protection. Methods This study included non-institutionalised civilian population divided into four age groups: children 7-11 years, adolescent 12-17 years, 18-44 years and 44 years old or older. The sample size calculation was based on the reported prevalences in other studies for the outcomes of mental disorders, depression, suicide, associated morbidity, and alcohol use. A probabilistic, cluster, stratified and multistage selection process was used. Expansions factors to the total population were calculated. Results A total of 15,351 completed surveys were collected and were distributed according to the age groups: 2727, 7-11 years, 1754, 12-17 years, 5889, 18-44 years, and 4981, ≥45 years.

Results From the National Mental Health Survey of Colombia 2015,"Introduction The prevalence of chronic conditions is increasing globally and this phenomenon covers pediatric populations. There is a relationship between chronic conditions and mental health problems, which has been insufficiently studied in the case of children. Objective To measure the frequency of problems and mental disorders in the Colombian population between 7 and 11 years, depending on the presence or absence of chronic conditions. Methods The information pertains to the National Survey of Mental Health of Colombia 2015, an observational cross-sectional nationally representative for the group between 7 and 11 years old. Mental problems where measure with the Reporting Questionnaire for Children (RQC), the 12 month prevalence of seven mental disorders were assessed using the Diagnostic Interview Schedule for Children Version parents (DISC-P) and a list of chronic conditions. Univariate and stratification analysis of the data were performed. Results 41.6% of the children with no chronic conditions, 56.7% of the children with 1 chronic condition and 70.8% in those with 2 or more have at least one RQC symptom; the highest prevalence of mental health symptoms are those with chronic inflammatory lung disease, followed by diabetes mellitus and allergies. The prevalence of one or more mental disorders in children without chronic conditions is 3.1% while those with at least 1 is 13.8%. Conclusions A higher prevalence of mental disorders in children and its association with chronic conditions justifies further studies that address this issue and develop strategies with multidisciplinary interventions.",Article,"Gomez-Restrepo, Carlos.; Ramirez, Sandra Milena.; Tamayo Martinez, Nathalie.; Rodriguez, Nelcy.; Unknown.; Unknown",Children;Chronic disease;Mental disorders,Children;Chronic disease;Mental disorders,Colombia;Colombia;Colombia;Colombia;Colombia,

Material and methods: This is an observational, retrospective descriptive study of 507 patients with a diagnosis of neurocognitive disorder (according to DSM-5 criteria) evaluated in a referral centre in Bogotá, Colombia, in 2015. Results: Among the group of patients assessed, analyses reveal mean age for minor neurocognitive disorders of 71.04 years, and 75.32 years for major neurocognitive disorder (P < 0.001). A total of 62.72% of the sample were female. The most prevalent aetiology of the neurocognitive disorders was Alzheimer's disease, followed by behavioural variant frontotemporal dementia and neurocognitive disorders due to multiple aetiologies. BD occur more frequently in neurocognitive disorder due to behavioural variant frontotemporal dementia (100%), Alzheimer's disease (77.29%) and vascular disease (76.19%). The most prevalent BD in the group assessed were apathy (50.75%), irritability (48.45%), aggression (16.6%), and emotional lability (14.76%). Conclusions: BD are highly prevalent in patients with diagnosis of major neurocognitive disorder. BD are more prevalent in behavioural variant frontotemporal dementia than any other group. Apathy, irritability, emotional lability and aggression are the BD that occur with greater prevalence in our sample.

Up to a quarter of the population has reported mental health disorders. This has been studied mainly from a nosological perspective, according to diagnostic criteria. Nevertheless, we did not find studies that have explored the daily expressions of the population. Our objective was to evaluate the perceptions of the COVID-19 pandemic and its repercussions on the emotional well-being of the Colombian population. Methods: We performed a Twitter metrics and trend analysis. Initially, in the trend analysis, we calculated the average duration in hours of the 20 most popular trending topics of the day in Colombia and we grouped them into trends related to COVID-19 and unrelated trends. Subsequently, we identified dates of events associated with the pandemic relevant to the country, and they were related to the behaviour of the trends studied. Additionally, we did an exploratory analysis of these, selected the tweets with the greatest reach and categorised them in an inductive way to analyse them qualitatively. Results: Issues not related to COVID-19 were more far-reaching than those related to coronavirus. However, a rise in these issues was seen on some dates consistent with important events in Colombia. We found expressions of approval and disapproval, solidarity and accusation. Inductively, we identified categories of informative tweets, humour, fear, stigma and discrimination, politics and entities, citizen complaints, and self-care and optimism. Conclusions: The impact of the COVID-19 pandemic generates different reactions in the population, which increasingly have more tools to express themselves and know the opinions of others. Social networks play a fundamental role in the communication of the population, so this content could serve as a public health surveillance tool and a useful and accessible means of communication in the management of health crises.",Article,"Botero-Rodriguez, Felipe.; Unknown.; Martinez Torres, Liz Mariana.; Bolivar-Mona, Santiago.; Unknown.; Unknown.; Franco, Oscar H.; Gomez-Restrepo, Carlos",Coronavirus infections;Mental health;Public health;Social networking,Coronavirus infections;Mental health;Public health;Social networking,Colombia;Colombia;Colombia;Switzerland,

Its usefulness is directly related to the integration of objectives, contents, methodologies and specific resources in each area of knowledge. Objective To describe the development of an educational experience implemented in the Pontificia Universidad Javeriana Cali (Cali, Colombia) with medical students of Human Behavior II program, between 2012 and 2013. This experience was performed with simulated patients played by actors of the Altergesto theater group, that were interviewed by students under the supervision of psychiatrists and teachers of the subject, using the Simulated Hospital of the University. Methods A historical development recall of the teaching sequence was made from the first half of 2012 to the second half of 2013, a statement of pedagogical objectives, and a description of the teaching-learning strategies. Results 158 interviews were conducted over a period of two years during which it was necessary to raise methodological solutions to adapt this teaching sequence to the content and objectives of the subject. Conclusions The high-fidelity simulation, integrating actors who represent psychiatric patients mixed with the technology of a Simulated Hospital was useful to achieve compliance with the objectives proposed in the course of Human Behavior II, as a part of the program of Medicine at the Pontificia Universidad Javeriana Cali. In parallel, the construction of experience as an interdisciplinary project and the practical approach of this strategy may impact on cognitive, emotional, behavioral dimensions of the participants, encouraging meaningful learning.

The objective of this study is to determine the presence of cortical release signs in patients with mental illnesses and cerebrovascular disease, as well as its clinical usefulness, given that it indicates cortical damage. Material and methods A review was made of cortical release signs in patients hospitalized in clinical psychiatry and general hospitals with bipolar affective disorder (40), depression (37), schizophrenia (33), cardiovascular disease (33) and dementia (37). Results The signs of cortical release do not have the same importance as cortical damage. For example, the glabellar reflex was found in all the groups, that of paratonia, particularly in the group with schizophrenia, and others signs in the group of patients with dementia. Conclusions It is suggested that these signs imply subcortical white matter damage.

Prioritize the proposed recommendations, identify barriers and solving strategies to implement the GPC-E, and develop a monitoring and evaluation system for the key recommendations. Method The Guideline Developer Group (GDG) included professionals with primary dedication to implementation issues that accompanied the entire process. During the GDG meetings implementation topics were identified and discussed, and later complemented by literature reviews concerning the experience of mental health guidelines implementation at national and international level. Additionally, feedback from the discussions raised during the socialization meetings, and joint meetings with the MSPS and the Institute of Technology Assessment in Health (IETS) were included. The prioritization of recommendations was made in conjunction with the GDG, following the proposed steps in the methodological guide for the development of Clinical Practice Guidelines with Economic Evaluation in the General System of Social Security in Colombian Health (GMEGPC) using the tools 13 and 14. the conclusions and final adjustments were discussed with the GPC-E leaders. Results The implementation chapter includes a description of the potential barriers, solution strategies, facilitators and monitoring indicators. The identified barriers were categorized in the following 3 groups: Cultural context, health system and proposed interventions. The issues related to solving strategies and facilitating education programs include community mental health, mental health training for health workers in primary care, decentralization and integration of mental health services at the primary care level, use of technologies information and communication and telemedicine. To monitor and evaluate o the implementation process, five (5) indicators were designed one (1) structure, two (2) process and two (2)outcome indicators.

They are defined as perceptions in the absence of an external stimulus, and can be created in any sensory modality. Their neurophysiological substrate is almost the same as the one activated during sensory perception. There is no unified theory about its function, but it is possibly the way that our brain uses and manipulates the information to respond to the environment.

This evidence is used to propose recommendation in the guidelines of integral attention for the diagnosis, treatment and psychosocial rehabilitation of adults with schizophrenia. Methods: A guideline for clinical practice was developed using the methodological framework of the Ministerio de la Protección Social to collect evidence and grading recommendations. A search, evaluation and synthesis of evidence were carried out. The evidence was presented to the Guideline Developing Group and recommendations, employing the GRADE system, were produced. Results: The psychoeducation and family intervention showed higher efficacy, compared with the usual treatment, to prevent relapses and hospital readmissions, to reduce family burden and to improve adherence to treatment. The social skill training was effective to improve symptoms, social functioning and quality of life. However, the quality of evidence was low. There was not enough evidence about the efficacy of occupational therapy, but considering patients preferences and its wide clinical utilization, the GDG suggested its inclusion.

Different aspects, such as the perception of others, self-knowledge, motivation and the cultural context, can modulate empathy responses and moral judgments regarding the actions of others. The National Mental Health Survey (ENSM for its acronym in Spanish) explored aspects of social cognition such as the perception of emotions, empathy and moral judgment in situations in which another person experiences pain. Objective To describe the overall findings of the ENSM in relation to the emotional perception and empathic responses to situations where pain is inflicted on others in an intentional or accidental manner. Methods A total of 3863 people aged 18-96 years old completed the social cognition module. They were asked to identify the emotions expressed in the images of several faces. A modified version of the awareness of social inference test (TASIT) was used. Additionally, the cognitive, affective, and moral elements of empathy were assessed with a modified version of the empathy for pain task (EPT), which uses a sequence of images in which someone is being hurt. Results Happiness was identified by 91.5% of those interviewed; neutral or emotionless faces were identified by 65%; 55% of respondents correctly identified surprise. Only 19.7%, 21.8% and 27.4% could identify negative emotions like fear, disgust and sadness, respectively. When the data were analysed by age, poverty status, and different regions of the country, the results tend to vary. As regards empathy, 73.7% correctly identified intentional actions, and accidental actions were identified by 56.6%. According to the moral judgment of some respondents, even in situations where the pain was caused by accident, there must be some kind of punishment (20.7% deserved a low punishment and 26.8% a moderate one). Conclusions Noteworthy findings include the high recognition of happiness by the respondents, in contrast to the apparent difficulty in recognising sadness, and paradoxical results regarding punishment and empathy. This should be studied in greater detail, but these results can contribute to a deeper understanding of the complex Colombian social context.",Article,"Matallana, Diana L.; Gomez-Restrepo, Carlos.; Unknown.; Tamayo Martinez, Nathalie.; Unknown",Emotions;Empathy;Social psychology,Emotions;Empathy;Social psychology,Colombia;Colombia,

Methods Observational study for scale validation. Validity criteria were used to determine the severity cut-off points of the tool. Taking into account sensitivity and specificity values, those cut points were contrasted with ICD-10 criteria for depression severity. A a factor analysis was performed. The internal consistencY was determined with the same sample of patients used for the validity criteria. Inter-rater reliability was assessed by evaluating the 22 records of the patients that consented to a video interview. Sensitivity to change was established through a second application of the scale in 28 subjects after a lapse of 14 to 28 days. Results The study was performed in Bogotá, the tool was applied in 150 patients suffering from major depressive disorder. The cut-off point for moderate depression was 20 (sensitivity, 98%; specificity, 96%), and the cut-off point for severe depression was 34 (sensitivity, 98%; specificity, 92%). The tool appears as a unidimensional scale, which possesses a good internal consistency with (α=.9168). The findings of inter-rater reliability evaluation showed the scale as highly reliable (intraclass correlation coefficient=.9833). The instrument has a good sensitivity to change.

Screening and addressing at-risk drinking in primary care settings is an empirically supported health care intervention strategy to help reduce the burden of alcohol-use problems. In preparation for introducing screening and treatment for at-risk drinking in primary care clinics in Colombia, we conducted interviews with clinicians, clinic administrators, patients, and participants in Alcoholics Anonymous. Interviews were conducted within the framework of the Detección y Atención Integral de Depresión y Abuso de Alcohol en Atención Primaria (DIADA [Detection and Integrated Care for Depression and Alcohol Use in Primary Care] www.project-diada.org) research project, and its qualitative phase that consisted of the collection of data from 15 focus groups, 6 interviews and field observations in 5 regional settings. All participants provided informed consent to participate in this research. Findings revealed the association of harmful alcohol use with a culture of consumption, within which it is learned and socially accepted practice. Recognition of harmful alcohol consumption includes a social context that influences its screening, diagnosis and prevention.

To better understand opportunities to improve access to mental healthcare in Colombia, a research team at Javeriana University conducted formative qualitative research to explore stakeholders’ experiences with the integration of mental healthcare into the primary care system. Methods: The research team conducted 16 focus groups and 4 in-depth interviews with patients, providers, health administrators and representatives of community organisations at 5 primary care clinics in Colombia, and used thematic analysis to study the data. Results: Themes were organised into barriers and facilitators at the level of patients, providers, organisations and facilities. Barriers to the treatment of depression included stigma, lack of mental health literacy at the patient and provider level, weak links between care levels, and continued need for mental health prioritisation at the national level. Facilitators to the management of depression in primary care included patient support systems, strong patient-provider relationships, the targeting of depression interventions and national depression guidelines.

Among them is the increase in cases of delirium. The severe SARS-CoV-2 disease, COVID-19, has common vulnerabilities with delirium and produces alterations in organs such as the lungs or the brain, among others, which have the potential to trigger the mental disorder. In fact, delirium may be the first manifestation of the infection, before fever, general malaise, cough or respiratory disturbances. It is widely supported that delirium increases the morbidity and mortality in those who suffer from it during hospitalization, so it should be actively sought to carry out the relevant interventions. In the absence of evidence on the approach to delirium in the context of COVID-19, this consensus was developed on three fundamental aspects: diagnosis, non-pharmacological treatment and pharmacological treatment, in patients admitted to the general hospital.

Methods: Focus groups with patients from two psychiatric clinics, with discourse analysis. Results: Five deductive categories (tools, capacity, therapeutic relationship, method and family and network), plus one additional category from the analysis (stigma), and 35 inductive (posterior) categories were considered. The categories are analysed and the findings presented. Conclusions: Patients express a need for greater participation in decisions about their treatment, and a more symmetrical psychiatrist-patient relationship, involving families. Decisions may be changed due to stigma, barriers to treatment access, and previous experiences.",Article,"de la Espriella, Ricardo",Decision making;Mental hospital;Psychiatry;Qualitative research,Decision making;Mental hospital;Psychiatry;Qualitative research,Colombia,

Of all the deaths, suicide is the one which more strongly questions the functionality of a family and increases the risk of difficulties in the mourning process. Families in which a suicide has occurred are exposed to a greater possibility of disintegration, disorganization and pathological expressions in their members. Objective To present a reduced and circumscribed narrative revision, restricted to examine the relationship between suicide and the mourning process in the family. Results The suicide of a loved one is an event that may contribute to pathological grief and mental dysfunctions in surviving relatives. Conclusions Death in the family is a natural phenomenon. However, death by suicide is one of the phenomena that can generate more alterations in the structure and organization of the family, due to the difficulty related to the mourning process. © 2013 Asociación Colombiana de Psiquiatría.

The corpus was built based on the analysis and interpretation gathered from families with mental illness members. There were 17 individual interviews, 13 group interviews and one family group of three generations, held regarding the clinical care of the family member. These interviews were held at three different hospitals in Bogota. The representation of ""a family"" constitutes the structuring of the meanings of family relationships that cope with mental illness built upon the social and historical life of its members. The three comprehensive categories were: a) Family in good times and bad times; b) mental illness in family interactions, and c) Care and burden. Socially speaking, mental illness can lead to dehumanization, in that it discriminates and stigmatizes, even within the family unit. Caring for a family member with mental illness comes about by hierarchical order, self assignation, and by institutionalization. This latter occurs due to lack of caregivers or because the family does not consider their home the best place to care for such a patient.",Article,"Solano-Murcia, Martha.; Cardozo, Socorro Vasquez",Burden of illness;Family caregivers;Mental illness;Social perception (social representations),Burden of illness;Family caregivers;Mental illness;Social perception (social representations),Colombia;Colombia,

The objective was to make changes in hospital practices that facilitate spaces for the well-being of healthcare worker teams. Methods: We conducted an ongoing intervention during the first year of this outbreak. We established peer support groups by videoconference and individual virtual interventions for specialist physicians, resident physicians, nurses, and support personnel, focusing on problems and emotions related to the psychological impact of being on the clinical front line working with patients with pneumonia due to SARS-CoV-2 (COVID-19). Results: The group work helped the expression of feelings, peer support, and validation of personal emotional experience. The participants expressed the need for physical and psychological security in the battle against COVID-19 and the need for interpersonal ties and giving meaning to their experiences. Conclusions: Based on our findings, we consider it necessary to investigate the potentially traumatic experiences of healthcare workers and provide evidence-based knowledge that can generate novel approaches in psychosocial support work structures for this group.",Article,"Oviedo Lugo, Gabriel Fernando.; Uribe, Jose Miguel.; Pinto Alvarez, Mariana.; Unknown.; Gomez-Chiappe, Nicolas",Active listening;COVID-19 pandemic;Healthcare workers;Telemedicine;Virtual support groups,Active listening;COVID-19 pandemic;Healthcare workers;Telemedicine;Virtual support groups,Colombia;Colombia;Colombia,

To assist the clinician decision-making process about complementary diagnostic evaluation strategies in adult diagnosed with schizophrenia. Methods A clinical practice guideline was elaborated under the parameters of the Methodological Guide of the Ministerio de Salud y Protección Social to identify, synthesize and evaluate the evidence and make recommendations about the treatment and follow-up of adult patients with schizophrenia. The evidence of NICE guide 82 was adopted and updated. The evidence was presented to the Guideline Developing Group and recommendations, employing the GRADE system, were produced. Results The risk of overall mortality in schizophrenia is higher than in the general population excluding suicide. Results related with mortality associated to antipsychotics showed contradictory results. Metabolic outcomes showed a higher incidence and association with schizophrenia and treatment with antipsychotics (AP). The diagnosis of dyslipidemia in men with schizophrenia appears to be lower in comparison with the general population. However, changes in weight, blood sugar levels, HDL cholesterol and triglycerides are influenced by the use of antipsychotics in general there is a higher risk of developing diabetes mellitus in adults with schizophrenia. Conclusion Based on the evidence found a plan was formulated for the evaluation of physiological and paraclinical variables during and before the management with AP in adult diagnosed with schizophrenia.

Traits may configure a personality disorder when there is a long-lasting rigid pattern of inner experience that deviates from the expectations of the individual's culture, are inflexible and form maladaptative schemes in different interpersonal scenarios. Given the pervasiveness of this structure, they cause impairment of functioning in the affected person. Objective To establish the prevalence of personality traits in all selected adults, using the module-structured interview WHO WHM-CIDI-CAPI for clusters A, B and C of personality traits. Methods Colombian National Survey on Mental Health with persons older than 18 years of age. Results Personality traits that are the most frequently described: Cluster A 46% (95%CI, 45.2-48.1) of people believe they are convinced that there are conspiracies behind many things in the world. Regarding the features of cluster B, 35.6% (95%CI, 34.2-37.0) of the population reports that generally they do not feel bad when offending or upsetting someone and 35.4% (95%CI, 33.9-36.8) refer to show feelings to anyone. The highest proportion of traits were found to the probable borderline personality disorder, as 4.6% (95%CI, 4.1-5.2) of the Colombian population aged 18 and older has 6 or more features of this type, and is the widely reported as an individual entity with similar rates in men and women. Conclusions The high prevalence of disruptive personality traits requires more research. The high prevalence reported for borderline personality traits suggests the need to implement measures to improve and integrate a collaborative model of care for people afflicted with a possible borderline personality disorder.",Article,"Oviedo, Gabriel Fernando.; Gomez-Restrepo, Carlos.; Unknown.; Borda Bohigas, Juan Pablo.; Tamayo Martinez, Nathalie",Personality;Personality disorders;Personality traits,Personality;Personality disorders;Personality traits,Colombia;Colombia;Colombia,
,,,1,2-s2.0-85086019047,2021,Self-recognition of mental disorders and mental problems in the adult population from the Colombian National Mental Health Survey,"Introduction and objectives: Mental disorders are very prevalent in the general population. Despite this, it is estimated that only about a third of the people affected is able to recognise problems on their own and to access health services. The aim was to determine the factors associated with the lack of self-recognition of mental problems and disorders in the Colombian population. Methods: The National Mental Health Survey (ENSM-2015) conducted in Colombia identified adults over 18 years that answered “yes’ to the question ‘Have you had a mental problem or disorder?’, had a positive score in mental disorders measured by the Composite International Diagnostic Interview (CIDI) 3.0, or in mental problems detected by the SRQ-20. A bivariate analysis, as well as a logistic regression, were performed with possible related variables. Results: A sample of 10, 870 adults was obtained, of whom 12.25% (1,332) had mental disorders and 30.2% (3282) had mental problems. Of those individuals with disorders and problems, 7.9% recognised themselves as affected. The variables associated with self-recognition of disorders or problems were, among others: being female (OR = 1.8; 95%CI, 1.4-2.3), family dysfunction (OR = 1.5; 95%CI, 1.2-2.0), to have experienced a traumatic event (OR = 1.8; 95%CI, 1.4-2.2), illegal substance consumption (OR = 0.5; 95%CI, 0.4-0.7), not being poor (OR = 1.9; 95%CI, 1.2-3.0), and having chronic illnesses (OR = 1.6; 95%CI, 1.3-2.1).

Case Report,"Introduction: Excoriation (skin picking) disorder is included in the DSM-5 in the obsessive compulsive and related disorders category. It is defined as the recurrent urge to touch, scratch, scrape, scrub, rub, squeeze, bite or dig in the skin, leading to skin lesions. It is a rare disorder (1.4–5.4% of the population) and occurs mainly in women. Case report: this article reports the case of a 31-year-old female patient, initially assessed by dermatology and orthopaedics for the presence of infected ulcerated lesions on her lower limbs, with other superficial lesions from scratching on her chest, arms, forearms, back and head. The patient also reported symptoms of anxiety, so was assessed by consultation-liaison psychiatry. Discussion: skin picking, normal behaviour in mammals, becomes pathological from a psychiatric point of view when it is repetitive and persistent, as in the case of excoriation disorder. In view of the reported relationship with the obsessive-compulsive spectrum, use of selective serotonin reuptake inhibitors and cognitive behavioural therapy are recommended.",Article,"Unknown.; Suarez, Ginna Marcela.; Unknown.; Oviedo, Gabriel Fernando",Case report;Dermatillomania;Skin picking disorder,Case report;Dermatillomania;Skin picking disorder,Colombia;Colombia,

Methods: An anonymous survey was conducted based on the consensus of experts of the Liaison Psychiatry Committee of the Asociación Colombiana de Psiquiatría [Colombian Psychiatric Association] and on the literature review. It was sent by email to the association members. Results: 101 clinicians participated. Non-pharmacological preventive measures such as psychoeducation, correction of sensory problems or sleep hygiene are performed by 70% or more. Only about 1 in 10 participants are part of an institutional multi-component prevention programme. The preventive prescription of drugs was less than 20%. Regarding non-pharmacological treatment, more than 75% recommend correction of sensory difficulties, control of stimuli and reorientation. None of the participants indicated that the care at their centres is organised to enhance non-pharmacological treatment. 17.8% do not use medication in the treatment of delirium. Those who use it prefer haloperidol or quetiapine, particularly in hyperactive or mixed motor subtypes. Conclusions: The practices of the respondents coincide with those of other experts around the world. In general, non-pharmacological actions are individual initiatives, which demonstrates the need in Colombian health institutions to commit to addressing delirium, in particular when its prevalence and consequences are indicators of quality of care.",Article,"Unknown.; Oviedo, Gabriel Fernando.; Unknown.; Unknown.; Unknown.; Unknown.; Unknown.; Velasquez Tirado, Juan David",Antipsychotics;Delirium;Health education;Primary prevention;Quality of health care;Therapeutics,Antipsychotics;Delirium;Health education;Primary prevention;Quality of health care;Therapeutics,Colombia;Colombia;Colombia;Colombia;Colombia;Colombia;Colombia;Colombia;Colombia;Colombia;Colombia,

Methods: A systematic search was conducted (MEDLINE, Embase, CENTRAL) in August 2019 and studies were selected according to predefined eligibility criteria. The main outcomes were clinical effectiveness, adherence to primary treatment and cost of implementation. Selection criteria: Studies with an experimental or quasi-experimental design that evaluated the implementation of technology-based mental healthcare models were included. Results: Five articles met the inclusion criteria. The models included technological devices such as tablets, cellphones and computers, with programs and mobile apps that supported decision-making in the care pathway. These decisions took place at different times, from the universal screening phase to the follow-up of patients with specific conditions. In general, the studies showed a decrease in the reported symptoms. However, there was great heterogeneity in both the health conditions and the outcomes, which hindered a quantitative synthesis. The assessment of risk of bias showed low quality of evidence. Conclusion: There is not enough evidence to support the implementation of a technology-based mental healthcare model.

,,,1,2-s2.0-85106322492,2021,The DIADA Project: A technology-based model of care for depression and risky alcohol use in Primary Care Centres in Colombia,"Introduction: People with mental health conditions frequently attend primary care centres, but these conditions are underdiagnosed and undertreated. The objective of this paper is to describe the model and the findings of the implementation of a technology-based model of care for depression and unhealthy alcohol use in primary care centres in Colombia. Methods: Between February 2018 and March 2020, we implemented a technology-based model of care for depression and unhealthy alcohol use, following a modified stepped wedge methodology, in 6 urban and rural primary care centres in Colombia. The model included a series of steps aimed at screening patients attending medical appointments with general practitioners and supporting the diagnosis and treatment given by the general practitioner. We describe the model, its implementation and the characteristics of the screened and assessed patients. Results: During the implementation period, we conducted 22,354 screenings among 16,188 patients. The observed rate of general practitioner-confirmed depression diagnosis was 10.1% and of confirmed diagnosis of unhealthy alcohol use was 1.3%. Patients with a depression diagnosis were primarily middle-aged women, while patients with unhealthy alcohol use were mainly young adult men. Discussion: The provision of training and technology-based strategies to screen patients and support the decision-making of general practitioners during the medical appointment enhanced the diagnosis and care provision of patients with depression and unhealthy alcohol use. However, time constraints, as well as structural and cultural barriers, were challenges for the implementation of the model, and the model should take into account local values, policies and resources to guarantee its long-term sustainability. As such, the long-term sustainability of the model will depend on the alignment of different stakeholders, including decision-makers, institutions, insurers, general practitioners, patients and communities, to reduce the amount of patients seeking medical care whose mental health conditions remain undetected, and therefore untreated, and to ensure an appropriate response to the demand for mental healthcare that was revealed by the implementation of our model.",Article,"Gomez-Restrepo, Carlos.; Cepeda, Magda.; Torrey, William C.; Castro-Diaz, Sergio.; Uribe, Jose Miguel.; Suarez-Obando, Fernando.; Marsch, Lisa A.",Depression;Mental health;Primary care;Technology;Unhealthy alcohol use,Depression;Mental health;Primary care;Technology;Unhealthy alcohol use,Colombia;Colombia;Colombia;United States,

The objective of this study is to describe and quantify the quantity and quality of the existing TCs in 5 different countries. Design: A multicenter quantitative description of the TCs was conducted in Argentina, Brazil, Colombia, Mexico and Peru. Methods: A survey was realized through the TCs regulatory entities of each country that accepted to participate in the study. Results: Of the 285 TCs identified in the 5 countries, 176 (62%) accepted to participate in this study. The TCs quality vas evaluated according to the scoring system stablished by De Leon, finding that 70% of the facilities have scores of 11/12 or 12/12 using these criteria. We also found that the majority of the De Leon criteria are known by more than 90% of the institutions, however, the dimensions of “separation of the community” and “encounter groups between residents” were the least known with 63 and 85% respectively. The main reasons for abandonment of TCs were “not accepting the rules of the institution” “lack of money” and “not feeling comfortable with the facilities”. 98% of the TCs provided services to other substance abuse problems, 94% for alcohol and 40% for other types of substances. Conclusions: The majority of the TCs identified in our sample meet the quality criteria stablished by De Leon, mostly providing services for substance abuse. However, they should put in place additional policies to improve the unfulfilled conditions and investigate the reasons for the dissatisfaction and abandonment of these institutions.",Article,"Gomez-Restrepo, Carlos.; Maldonado, Patricia.; Rodriguez, Nelcy.; Ruiz-Gaviria, Rafael.; Unknown.; Unknown.; Unknown.; Unknown.; Unknown.; Unknown.; Unknown.; Unknown",Alcohol consumption;De Leon criteria;Latin America;Substance related disorders;Therapeutic communities,Alcohol consumption;De Leon criteria;Latin America;Substance related disorders;Therapeutic communities,Peru;Colombia;Colombia;Brazil;Argentina;Mexico;Spain;Spain,
,,,0,2-s2.0-85105826596,2021,"Access barriers, self-recognition, and recognition of depression and unhealthy alcohol use: A qualitative study","Introduction: Access to healthcare services involves a complex dynamic, where mental health conditions are especially disadvantaged, due to multiple factors related to the context and the involved stakeholders. However, a characterisation of this phenomenon has not been carried out in Colombia, and this motivates the present study. Objectives: The objective of this study was to explore the causes that affect access to health services for depression and unhealthy alcohol use in Colombia, according to various stakeholders involved in the care process. Methods: In-depth interviews and focus groups were conducted with health professionals, administrative professionals, users, and representatives of community health organisations in five primary and secondary-level institutions in three regions of Colombia. Subsequently, to describe access to healthcare for depression and unhealthy alcohol use, excerpts from the interviews and focus groups were coded through content analysis, expert consensus, and grounded theory. Five categories of analysis were created: education and knowledge of the health condition, stigma, lack of training of health professionals, culture, and structure or organisational factors. Results: We characterised the barriers to a lack of illness recognition that affected access to care for depression or unhealthy alcohol use according to users, healthcare professionals and administrative staff from five primary and secondary care centres in Colombia. The groups identified that lack of recognition of depression was related to low education and knowledge about this condition within the population, stigma, and lack of training of health professionals, as well as to culture. For unhealthy alcohol use, the participants identified that low education and knowledge about this condition, lack of training of healthcare professionals, and culture affected its recognition, and therefore, healthcare access. Neither structural nor organisational factors seemed to play a role in the recognition or self-recognition of these conditions. Conclusions: This study provides essential information for the search for factors that undermine access to mental health in the Colombian context. Likewise, it promotes the generation of hypotheses that can lead to the development and implementation of tools to improve care in the field of mental illness.",Article,"Gomez-Restrepo, Carlos.; Unknown.; Marroquin-Rivera, Arturo.; Cepeda, Magda.; Suarez-Obando, Fernando.; Uribe, Jose Miguel.; Castro-Diaz, Sergio.; Cubillos, Leonardo.; Torrey, William C.; Bartels, S.

It has been proposed that this gap be reduced by strengthening and making use of community resources. This study explores the feasibility and one-year outcomes of a novel volunteer programme for patients with bipolar disorder and schizophrenia. Methods: In a non-controlled trial with a total of 30 patients, we instigated activities in groups of 5 people with severe mental disorders and individuals from the community. Symptoms, quality of life and social functioning before the intervention and after six and 12 months were assessed and compared using Student's t-test. Results: The volunteer intervention was feasible in the Colombian context. Social functioning after 6 months was improved, mainly due to an improvement in the domains of employment and friendship. However, the difference was no longer statistically significant after 12 months. Conclusions: In a country where there is a large gap in coverage and access to specialized mental health services, it is important to integrate effective and low-cost interventions that improve the mental health of the population through community resources. This intervention improved the social functioning of the patients, which indicates an effective and feasible intervention for implementation in our context.

This study sought to characterise the profile of social media users, among primary care patients in Colombia, and to assess predictors of their use of social media to search for health and mental health information (searching behaviour). Methods: As part of a larger scale-up study, we surveyed 1,580 patients across six primary care sites in Colombia about their social media use. We used chi-square and Student's t-tests to assess associations between demographic variables, social media use and searching behaviour, and a Chi-square Automatic Interaction Detector (CHAID) analysis to determine predictors of searching behaviour. Results: In total, 44.4% of respondents reported that they were social media users. Of these, 35.7% used social media to search for health-related information and 6.6% used it to search for mental health-related information. While the profile of individuals who used social media to search for health-related information was similar to that of general social media users (the highest use was among women living in urban areas), the presence of mental health symptoms was a more important predictor of using social media to search for mental health-related information than demographic variables. Individuals with moderate-severe symptoms of anxiety reported a significantly higher percentage of searching than individuals without symptoms (12.5% vs. 5.2%). Conclusions: Given that some individuals with mental health disorders turn to social media to understand their illness, social media could be a successful medium for delivering mental health interventions in Colombia.",Article,"Bartels, S.

,,,0,2-s2.0-85130354960,2022,Activation Syndrome in Children and Adolescents Treated with Selective Serotonin Reuptake Inhibitors,"Introduction and objectives: Selective serotonin reuptake inhibitors (SSRIs) are medications used in child and adolescent psychiatry mainly for the treatment of depression, anxiety and obsessive compulsive disorder. In general, these medications are safe and well tolerated. However, they can cause adverse effects such as activation syndrome, which if not identified can negatively affect adherence and response to treatment. Activation syndrome has received little attention and can be difficult to recognise due to the lack of a clear definition and objective diagnostic measures, and also because it can be confused with a worsening of the psychiatric disorder or mania triggered by the antidepressants. For all the above, it is important that professionals who prescribe antidepressants in the paediatric population are able to identify and manage activation syndrome when it occurs. Our aim was to carry out a narrative review of activation syndrome in children and adolescents treated with SSRIs in terms of definition, prevalence, pathophysiology, associated factors, relationship with suicide risk, management strategies and recommendations for reducing the risk of suicidal behaviours when using antidepressants in this population. Methods: We performed a non-systematic narrative review of activation syndrome in children and adolescents which involved finding information in PubMed, Ovid, EBSCO, ProQuest and Embase. Review articles, prospective and retrospective investigations, systematic reviews, meta-analyses and other articles related to activation syndrome in children and adolescents were selected. The search was limited to studies published in English and Spanish that involved children and adolescents and no limits were applied to the publication date or study design. Results: A total of 62 articles were included, 61 of them in English. The results were grouped into the following topics: definition; prevalence; pathophysiology; associated factors; relationship with suicide risk; management strategies; and recommendations for reducing the risk of suicidal behaviours when using antidepressants in this population. Activation syndrome refers to a set of symptoms consisting of impulsiveness, restlessness, increased activity, insomnia, irritability, disinhibition and agitation. This syndrome is poorly characterised in terms of its definition, prevalence, risk factors and pathophysiology, a situation that limits its recognition and evaluation. There are many factors that predispose the development of the syndrome such as age, differences in brain development in the paediatric population, the characteristics of the patient or the antidepressant, disorders of neurological development, and the doses and plasma levels of the medications. It has been thought that activation syndrome may be related to suicidal tendencies. However, the evidence in support of this link is inconsistent and further studies are therefore necessary. Conclusions: Activation syndrome with SSRI is a particularly important adverse effect in children and adolescents and, when it occurs, can cause lack of adherence to or discontinuation of treatment. Strict vigilance is therefore recommended during the use of these medications.",Review,"Pulzara Velasco, Diana Marcela.; Unknown",Activation;Adverse events;Antidepressants;Children and adolescents;SSRI,Activation;Adverse events;Antidepressants;Children and adolescents;SSRI,Colombia,

The Ministry of Health and Social Protection of Colombia acknowledges that a great number of people with mental disorders do not seek medical aid due to stigma. Objectives: Characterise the perceived stigma towards mental health among the stakeholders involved in the early implementation of the DIADA project [Detección y Atención Integral de Depresión y Abuso de Alcohol en Atención Primaria (Detection and Integrated Care for Depression and Alcohol Use in Primary Care)]. Explore whether the implementation of this model can decrease stigma. Describe the impact of the implementation on the lives of patients and medical practice. Materials and methods: Eighteen stakeholders (7 patients, 5 physicians and 6 administrative staff) were interviewed and a secondary data analysis of 24 interview transcripts was conducted using a rapid analysis technique. Results: The main effects of stigma towards mental health disorders included refusing medical attention, ignoring illness, shame and labelling. Half of the stakeholders reported that the implementation of mental health care in primary care could decrease stigma. All of the stakeholders said that the implementation had a positive impact. Conclusions: The perceived stigma was characterised as social and aesthetic in nature. Communication and awareness about mental health is improving, which could facilitate access to mental health treatment and strengthen the doctor-patient relationship. Culture is important for understanding stigma towards mental health in the population studied.",Article,"Unknown.; Cardenas Charry, Maria Paula.; Uribe, Jose Miguel.; Cepeda, Magda.; Cubillos, Leonardo.; Bartels, S.

For this reason, the identification and validation of biomarkers is necessary. Within this group, possible electroencephalographic biomarkers have been reported to be useful in diagnosis, treatment and follow-up, both in neuropsychiatric conditions and in substance use disorders. This article aims to review the existing literature on electroencephalographic biomarkers in dual pathology. Methods: A narrative review of the literature. A bibliographic search was performed on the PubMed, Science Direct, OVID, BIREME and Scielo databases, with the key**words: electrophysiological biomarker and substance use disorder, electrophysiological biomarker and mental disorders, biomarker and dual pathology, biomarker and substance use disorder, electroencephalography, and substance use disorder or comorbid mental disorder. Results: Given the greater amount of literature found in relation to electroencephalography as a biomarker of mental illness and substance use disorders, and the few articles found on dual pathology, the evidence is organised as a biomarker in psychiatry for the diagnosis and prediction of risk and as a biomarker for dual pathology. Conclusions: Although the evidence is not conclusive, it suggests the existence of a subset of sites and mechanisms where the effects of psychoactive substances and the neurobiology of some mental disorders could overlap or interact.",Review,"Unknown.; Santamaria-Garcia, Hernando.; Unknown",Biomarkers;Dual pathology;Electroencephalography;Mental disorders;Substance-related disorders,Biomarkers;Dual pathology;Electroencephalography;Mental disorders;Substance-related disorders,Colombia;Colombia;Colombia;Colombia,

This study tests DIALOG+, an app-based intervention to make routine patient-clinician meetings therapeutically effective. It combines a structured evaluation of patient satisfaction with a solution-focused approach. Methods: We conducted a qualitative study, based on a controlled clinical trial, in which 9 psychiatrists and 18 patients used DIALOG+ monthly over a six-month period. Semi-structured interviews were used to explore the experiences of participants and analysed in an inductive thematic analysis focusing on the feasibility and effects of the intervention in the Colombian context. Results: Experiences were grouped into five overall themes: a) impact of the intervention on the consultation and the doctor-patient relationship; b) impact on patients and in promoting change; c) use of the supporting app, and d) adaptability of the intervention to the Colombian healthcare system. Conclusions: DIALOG+ was positively valued by most of the participants. Participants felt that it was beneficial to the routine consultation, improved communication and empowered patients to take a leading role in their care. More work is required to identify the patient groups that most benefit from DIALOG+, and to adjust it, particularly to fit brief consultation times, so that it can be rolled out successfully in the Colombian healthcare system.",Article,"Ramirez, Sandra Milena.; Unknown.; Unknown.; Uribe, Jose Miguel.; Unknown.; Unknown.; Gomez-Restrepo, Carlos",Information technology;Patient-centred communication;Psychosocial intervention;Psychosocial support;Quality of life;Severe mental disorders;Solution-focused therapy,Information technology;Patient-centred communication;Psychosocial intervention;Psychosocial support;Quality of life;Severe mental disorders;Solution-focused therapy,Colombia;Colombia;Colombia;Colombia;United Kingdom;Colombia,

The following article outlines the main points by which this relationship occurs, understanding how the project contributes to global mental health and, at the same time, how global mental health nurtures the development of this project. It reflects on aspects like the systematic screening of patients with mental illness, the use of technology in health, the adoption of a collaborative model, the investigation on implementation, a collaborative learning and the Colombian healthcare system. These are all key aspects when interpreting the feedback cycle between the individual and the global. The analysis of these components shows how collaborative learning is a central axis in the growth of global mental health: from the incorporation of methodologies, implementation of models, assessment of outcomes and, finally, the dissemination of results to local, regional and international stakeholders.",Article,"Uribe, Jose Miguel.; Gomez-Ayala, Maria Camila.; Unknown.; Cubillos, Leonardo.; Cepeda, Magda.; Gomez-Restrepo, Carlos",Behavioural health;Collaborative model;Colombia;Global mental health;Primary care;Technology in health,Behavioural health;Collaborative model;Colombia;Global mental health;Primary care;Technology in health,Colombia;Colombia;United States;United States,

However, little is known about how health-related quality of life (HRQoL) and health literacy are related among those with the two most common types of health insurance coverage: subsidised (those with lower incomes) and contributory (those with higher incomes) coverage. Objectives and methods: In the current exploratory investigation, data from adults visiting six primary care clinics in Colombia were analysed to examine the relationship between HRQoL (assessed as problems with mobility, self-care, completing usual activities, pain/discomfort, and anxiety/depression), demographics, the two health insurance types, and health literacy. Analyses also assessed whether, within insurance types, health literacy was related to HRQoL. Results: Results showed that those with contributory health insurance coverage had greater health literacy than those with subsidised coverage, and this was accounted for by differences in education and socioeconomic status. HRQoL did not differ by insurance type. Although lower health literacy was related to worse HRQoL in the overall sample, in subgroup analyses lower health literacy significantly related to worse HRQoL only among those with subsidised health insurance coverage. Conclusion: Targeting skills which contribute to health literacy, such as interpreting medical information or filling out forms, may improve HRQoL, particularly in those with subsidised insurance coverage.",Article,"Unknown.; Castro-Diaz, Sergio.; Cubillos, Leonardo.; Suarez-Obando, Fernando.; Torrey, William C.; Uribe, Jose Miguel.; Unknown.; Marsch, Lisa A.; Gomez-Restrepo, Carlos",Health literacy;Primary care;Quality of life,Health literacy;Primary care;Quality of life,Colombia;Colombia;United States;United States,

Objective: To determine the incidence of delirium and the frequency of its subtypes, as well as its associated factors, in patients admitted to different departments of a university hospital in Bogotá, Colombia. Methods: A cohort of patients over 18 years of age admitted to the internal medicine (IM), geriatrics (GU), general surgery (GSU), orthopaedics (OU) and intensive care unit (ICU) services of a university hospital was followed up between January and June 2018. To detect the presence of delirium, we used the CAM (Confusion Assessment Method) and the CAM-ICU if the patient had decreased communication skills. The delirium subtype was characterised using the RASS (Richmond Agitation and Sedation Scale). Patients were assessed on their admission date and then every two days until discharged from the hospital. Those in whom delirium was identified were referred for specialised intra-institutional interdisciplinary management. Results: A total of 531 patients admitted during the period were assessed. The overall incidence of delirium was 12% (95% CI, 0.3-14.8). They represented 31.8% of patients in the GU, 15.6% in the ICU, 8.7% in IM, 5.1% in the OU, and 3.9% in the GSU. The most frequent clinical display was the mixed subtype, at 60.9%, followed by the normoactive subtype (34.4%) and the hypoactive subtype (4.7%). The factors most associated with delirium were age (adjusted RR = 1.07; 95% CI, 1.05-1.09), the presence of four or more comorbidities (adjusted RR = 2.04; 95% CI, 1.31-3.20), and being a patient in the ICU (adjusted RR = 2.02; 95% CI, 1.22-3.35). Conclusions: The incidence of delirium is heterogeneous in the different departments of the university hospital. The highest incidence occurred in patients that were admitted to the GU. The mixed subtype was the most frequent one, and the main associated factors were age, the presence of four or more comorbidities, and being an ICU patient.",Article,"Oviedo Lugo, Gabriel Fernando.; Unknown.; Duarte Osorio, Andres.; Rincon, Carlos Javier.; Unknown.; Chavarria, Roberto.; Unknown.; Unknown.; Unknown.; Unknown.; Unknown.; Gomez-Restrepo, Carlos",CAM;CAM ICU;Delirium;Delirium assessment;Delirium subtypes;Geriatric Unit;Incidence,CAM;CAM ICU;Delirium;Delirium assessment;Delirium subtypes;Geriatric Unit;Incidence,Colombia;Colombia;Colombia;;Colombia,

Therefore caution is required when giving a diagnosis with prognostic implications. We use the psychodynamic perspective in order to take into consideration both pathological and healthy diagnostic aspects, and to promote evolutionary potential of each patient. Objective: To determine the inter-rater reliability and to test quantitatively and qualitatively the variables involved in the diagnoses of patients with suspected autism and child psychoses, based upon psychodynamic concepts. Methods: An inter-rater reliability study was carried on, based upon the diagnostic evaluation of videos of patients with suspected autism or child psychoses who attended the diagnostic meeting (observation session) at the Instituto de Ortopedia Infantil Roosevelt. Results: Kappa values were obtained, ranging from.24 to.50, with a reliability force varying from slight to moderate, and κ=.24 for personality organization. This type of diagnosis takes into account both the pathological and healthy aspects which make up personality organization. Finally, limitations and aspects that should be considered in further studies were discussed. Conclusions: The results reinforce the need to evaluate a child with major disorders in an interdisciplinary team, and but a single observer, in order to allow discussion, and debate, and therefore, avoid partial readings of the patient’ s psychological functioning.",Article,"Jordan-Quintero, Martha Isabel.; Ayala-Corredor, Catalina.; Unknown.; Unknown.; Unknown",Autism;Child psychosis;Inter-rater reliability;Interdisciplinary diagnosis,Autism;Child psychosis;Inter-rater reliability;Interdisciplinary diagnosis,Colombia;Colombia;Colombia;Colombia;Colombia;Colombia,

We use the Actor-Network Theory Framework (ANT) which posits that health outcomes are a product of a multitude of relationships between different stakeholders. The article focuses on the network configuration that develops between the actors and its effects on the processes of identification, care, and follow-up of people with UAU. The data come from five care centers that participated in the pilot phase of an implementation research project that seeks to apply evidence-based interventions for the detection and treatment of depression and unhealthy alcohol use. Semi-structured interviews and focus groups were conducted with patients, health and administrative staff, and users from Alcoholics Anonymous. The interviews were transcribed and coded using N-Vivo.

Cultural variations in preferences and degree of participation in care have been reported. The objective was to identify and characterise opinions, preferences concerning participation and decision-making methods regarding treatment among relatives of patients with mental illnesses treated in mental health institutions in Bogotá, Colombia. Methods: A qualitative focus-group study with 37 adult relatives of patients with mental illness seen in two psychiatric clinics and discourse analysis on decision-making based on constructivist grounded theory. Results: Four initial categories consistent with the literature, as well as a new culturally relevant category that emerged, called “companionship”, are presented. The initial deductive categories described are: companionship, tools, method, symptoms and treatment. Specific and exclusive themes were derived that resulted in 31 final emerging subcategories. Family members were seen to want to actively participate in the decision-making process along with the psychiatrist and the patient, but to face some specific difficulties in relation to mental illness making it difficult for them to act as efficient caregivers. A systemic scheme on the interaction of the categories in decision-making is proposed.

Methods A clinical practice guideline was elaborated under the parameters of the Methodological Guide of the Ministerio de Salud y Protección Social to identify, synthesize and evaluate the evidence and make recommendations about the treatment and follow-up of adult patients with schizophrenia. A systematic literature search was carried out. The evidence was presented to the Guideline Developing Group and recommendations, employing the GRADE system, were produced. Results The non-pharmacological interventions such as nutritional counseling by a nutritionist, exercise and psychotherapy are effective in preventing weight gain with the use of antipsychotics. (Kg Weight reduction in DM of-3.05 (-4.16,-1.94)). The antipsychotic change from olanzapine to aripiprazole showed weight loss and decreased BMI (decreased weight in KG DM-3.21 (-9.03,-2.61). The use of beta blockers was ineffective in reducing akathisia induced by antipsychotic; using as outcome the 50% reduction of symptoms of akathisia comparing beta-blockers with placebo RR was 1.4 (0.59, 1.83). Conclusion It is recommended to make psychotherapeutic accompaniment and nutrition management of overweight for patients with weight gain. If these alternatives are ineffective is suggested to change the antipsychotic or consider starting metformin. For the management of drug-induced akathisia it is recommended to decrease the dose of the drug and the addition of lorazepam. It is recommended using 5 mg biperiden IM or trihexyphenidyl 5 mg orally in case of secondary acute dystonia and for the treatment of antipsychotic-induced parkinsonism to decrease the dose of antipsychotic or consider using 2-4 mg/day of biperiden or diphenhydramine 50 mg once daily.",Article,"Unknown.; Gomez-Restrepo, Carlos.; Bohorquez-Penaranda, Adriana Patricia.; Unknown.; Unknown.; Unknown.; Unknown",Adverse effects;Antipsychotics;Clinical Practice Guidelines;Follow-up;Schizophrenia,Adverse effects;Antipsychotics;Clinical Practice Guidelines;Follow-up;Schizophrenia,Colombia;Colombia;Colombia;Colombia,

Methods: A non-experimental quantitative analysis was conducted. The sociodemographic data of DIADA [Detección y Atención Integral de Depresión y Abuso de Alcohol en Atención Primaria (Detection and Integrated Care for Depression and Alcohol Use in Primary Care)] study participants had been previously collected. At the time of the evaluation (September 12, 2019), only the participants who had been in the project for a minimum of three months were included. By using univariate (Chi-squared) analyses, we studied the association between participants’ sociodemographic profile and their rate of compliance with the first follow-up assessment at three months after study initiation. Results: At the date of the evaluation, 584 adult participants were identified, of which 389 had been involved in the project for more than three months. From the participants included, 320 performed the first follow-up, while 69 did not. The compliance rate to the first follow-up was 82.3% (CI 95% 78.1%-86%) and was not affected by: site location, age, sex, civil status, level of education, use of smartphone, PHQ9 score (measuring depression symptomatology) or AUDIT score (measuring harmful alcohol use). Participants who do not use a smartphone, from rural areas and with a lower socioeconomic status, tended to show higher compliance rates. Statistically significant associations were found; participants with lower job stability and a lack of access to the Internet showed higher compliance rates to the early initial follow-up assessment. Conclusions: The compliance rate was high and generally constant in spite of the variability of the sociodemographic profiles of the participants, although several sub-groups of participants showed particularly high rates of compliance. These findings may suggest that integrating mental health into primary care allows the structural and financial barriers that hinder access to health in Colombia to be broken down by raising awareness about mental illnesses, their high prevalence and the importance of timely and accessible medical management.",Article,"Cardenas Charry, Maria Paula.; Unknown.; Uribe, Jose Miguel.; Cepeda, Magda.; Unknown.; Cubillos, Leonardo.; Bartels, S.

Few studies have compared the Health-Related Quality of Life (HRQoL) in patients with and without MCI due to PD (PD-MCI), and its correlation to patients’ subjective cognitive and communicative difficulties has not been explored. Objective: We aimed to compare HRQoL in PD-MCI and PD without MCI (PD-nMCI), and explore its possible relationship to subjective cognitive and communicative complaints. Methods: We included 29 PD-nMCI and 11 PD-MCI patients. The HRQoL was assessed with the Parkinson's Disease Questionnaire-39 (PDQ-39): its Cognition dimension was used as a measure of subjective cognitive complaints, its Communication dimension for subjective communicative complaints, and the summary index (PDQ-39 SI) as an indicator of HRQoL. Non-parametric partial correlations between the Cognition and Communication dimensions, and the adjusted PDQ-39 SI were conducted. Results: PD-MCI patients had greater subjective cognitive and communicative complaints and worse HRQoL than PD-nMCI patients. In the PD-MCI group, both subjective cognitive and communicative complaints exhibited significant direct correlations with the adjusted HRQoL scores. Conclusions: HRQoL seems to be affected in PD-MCI, and it might be influenced by greater subjective cognitive and communicative complaints.

Objective: The purpose of this article is to carry out a conceptual and clinical reflection on the semiology around the concept and experience of migration, in order to illustrate the complexity that it entails as a human phenomenon. Methods: A reduced narrative review, circumscribed and restricted to the semiological, psychopathological and clinical aspects of migration. Discussion: The separation, ruptures and losses that derive from migration do not go unnoticed by the individual. They are inscribed in his/her corporality as physiological injuries that affect his/her life and as symbolic injuries that affect his/her existence. Conclusions: Migration supposes a rupture of the totality of being. The context, the perception of others and relationships are cut off from the total unity that is the individual, as if he/she lost half of him/herself.",Review,"Imaz, Jose Antonio Garciandia.; Unknown",Emotions;Migration;Migratory grief;Psycopathological processes,Emotions;Migration;Migratory grief;Psycopathological processes,Colombia,

This report presents the case of a 29-year-old patient with a 14.4-week pregnancy who was diagnosed with Wernicke's encephalopathy associated with hyperemesis gravidarum, in a patient with a history of dissociative symptoms that had required hospitalization, which made it difficult to making the diagnosis. Main symptoms: The patient presented neuropsychiatric symptoms consistent in disorientation in time and space, failure to recognize her relatives, incoherent language, psychomotor agitation and dissociative symptoms. Main diagnoses, therapeutic interventions and results: Magnetic resonance imaging showed edema of the mammillary bodies and the patient's symptoms began to improve when IM thiamine supplementation was started. Conclusion: Although in most cases Wernicke's encephalopathy is associated with heavy alcohol consumption, it can also appear as a complication of hyperemesis in pregnant women, with high maternal and fetal morbidity and mortality, which warrants early detection and treatment of the condition. In addition, the question arises about the fluctuating presentation of its symptoms and whether these are part of a picture of psychiatric aetiology, or are an additional manifestation of Wernicke's encephalopathy.",Article,"Unknown.; Filizzola Bermudez, Juan David.; Unknown",Behavioral symptoms;Hyperemesis gravidarum;Wernicke's encephalopathy,Behavioral symptoms;Hyperemesis gravidarum;Wernicke's encephalopathy,Colombia;Colombia,

The extraction of DNA from sediment samples and the direct application of pyrosequencing resulted in approximately 215 Mb of data from four distinct mangrove areas (BrMgv01 to 04) in Brazil. The taxonomic approaches applied revealed the dominance of Deltaproteobacteria and Gammaproteobacteria in the samples. Paired statistical analysis showed higher proportions of specific taxonomic groups in each dataset. The metabolic reconstruction indicated the possible occurrence of processes modulated by the prevailing conditions found in mangrove sediments. In terms of carbon cycling, the sequences indicated the prevalence of genes involved in the metabolism of methane, formaldehyde, and carbon dioxide. With respect to the nitrogen cycle, evidence for sequences associated with dissimilatory reduction of nitrate, nitrogen immobilization, and denitrification was detected. Sequences related to the production of adenylsulfate, sulfite, and H2S were relevant to the sulphur cycle. These data indicate that the microbial core involved in methane, nitrogen, and sulphur metabolism consists mainly of Burkholderiaceae, Planctomycetaceae, Rhodobacteraceae, and Desulfobacteraceae. Comparison of our data to datasets from soil and sea samples resulted in the allotment of the mangrove sediments between those samples. The results of this study add valuable data about the composition of microbial communities in mangroves and also shed light on possible transformations promoted by microbial organisms in mangrove sediments.",Article,"Andreote, F.D.; Jimenez, D.J.; Chaves, D.; Dias, A.C.F.; Luvizotto, D.M.; Dini-Andreote, F.; Fasanella, C.C.; Lopez, M.V.; Baena, S.; Taketani, R.G.; de Melo, I.S.",,SULFATE-REDUCING BACTERIA;ARCHAEAL COMMUNITIES;DIVERSITY;PRODUCTIVITY;GENERATION;REDUCTION;RESOURCE;GENOMICS;ECOLOGY;SERVER,Brazil;Colombia,2-s2.0-84862665622
,,,133,WOS:000263288200045,2008,Avoiding Costly Conservation Mistakes: The Importance of Defining Actions and Costs in Spatial Priority Setting,"Background: The typical mandate in conservation planning is to identify areas that represent biodiversity targets within the smallest possible area of land or sea, despite the fact that area may be a poor surrogate for the cost of many conservation actions. It is also common for priorities for conservation investment to be identified without regard to the particular conservation action that will be implemented. This demonstrates inadequate problem specification and may lead to inefficiency: the cost of alternative conservation actions can differ throughout a landscape, and may result in dissimilar conservation priorities. Methodology/Principal Findings: We investigate the importance of formulating conservation planning problems with objectives and cost data that relate to specific conservation actions. We identify priority areas in Australia for two alternative conservation actions: land acquisition and stewardship. Our analyses show that using the cost surrogate that most closely reflects the planned conservation action can cut the cost of achieving our biodiversity goals by half. We highlight spatial differences in relative priorities for land acquisition and stewardship in Australia, and provide a simple approach for determining which action should be undertaken where. Conclusions/Significance: Our study shows that a poorly posed conservation problem that fails to pre-specify the planned conservation action and incorporate cost a priori can lead to expensive mistakes. We can be more efficient in achieving conservation goals by clearly specifying our conservation objective and parameterising the problem with economic data that reflects this objective.",Article,"Carwardine, J.; Wilson, K.A.; Watts, M.; Etter, A.; Klein, C.J.; Possingham, H.P.",,CAPE FLORISTIC REGION;BIODIVERSITY HOTSPOT;OPPORTUNITY COSTS;AREAS;IRREPLACEABILITY;PRIORITIZATION;DISTRIBUTIONS;VULNERABILITY;SELECTION;DESIGN,Australia;Colombia,
,,,121,WOS:000308206000061,2012,Land Cover Change in Colombia: Surprising Forest Recovery Trends between 2001 and 2010,"Background: Monitoring land change at multiple spatial scales is essential for identifying hotspots of change, and for developing and implementing policies for conserving biodiversity and habitats. In the high diversity country of Colombia, these types of analyses are difficult because there is no consistent wall-to-wall, multi-temporal dataset for land-use and land-cover change. Methodology/Principal Findings: To address this problem, we mapped annual land-use and land-cover from 2001 to 2010 in Colombia using MODIS (250 m) products coupled with reference data from high spatial resolution imagery (QuickBird) in Google Earth. We used QuickBird imagery to visually interpret percent cover of eight land cover classes used for classifier training and accuracy assessment. Based on these maps we evaluated land cover change at four spatial scales country, biome, ecoregion, and municipality. Of the 1,117 municipalities, 820 had a net gain in woody vegetation (28,092 km(2)) while 264 had a net loss (11,129 km(2)), which resulted in a net gain of 16,963 km(2) in woody vegetation at the national scale. Woody regrowth mainly occurred in areas previously classified as mixed woody/plantation rather than agriculture/herbaceous. The majority of this gain occurred in the Moist Forest biome, within the montane forest ecoregions, while the greatest loss of woody vegetation occurred in the Llanos and Apure-Villavicencio ecoregions. Conclusions: The unexpected forest recovery trend, particularly in the Andes, provides an opportunity to expand current protected areas and to promote habitat connectivity. Furthermore, ecoregions with intense land conversion (e.g. Northern Andean Paramo) and ecoregions under-represented in the protected area network (e.g. Llanos, Apure-Villavicencio Dry forest, and Magdalena-Uraba Moist forest ecoregions) should be considered for new protected areas.",Article,"Sanchez-Cuervo, A.M.; Aide, T.M.; Clark, M.L.; Etter, A.",,DEFORESTATION;MIGRATION;PATTERNS;MODIS;GLOBALIZATION;BIODIVERSITY;ECOREGIONS;DRIVERS,United States;Colombia,2-s2.0-84865590370

The Latin American Consortium of Studies in Obesity (LASO),"Background: Limited knowledge on the prevalence and distribution of risk factors impairs the planning and implementation of cardiovascular prevention programs in the Latin American and Caribbean (LAC) region. Methods and Findings: Prevalence of hypertension, diabetes mellitus, abnormal lipoprotein levels, obesity, and smoking were estimated from individual-level patient data pooled from population-based surveys (1998-2007, n = 31,009) from eight LAC countries and from a national survey of the United States (US) population (1999-2004) Age and gender specific prevalence were estimated and age-gender adjusted comparisons between both populations were conducted. Prevalence of diabetes mellitus, hypertension, and low high-density lipoprotein (HDL)-cholesterol in LAC were 5% (95% confidence interval [95% CI]: 3.4, 7.9), 20.2% (95% CI: 12.5, 31), and 53.3% (95% CI: 47, 63.4), respectively. Compared to LAC region's average, the prevalence of each risk factor tended to be lower in Peru and higher in Chile. LAC women had higher prevalence of obesity and low HDL-cholesterol than men. Obesity, hypercholesterolemia, and hypertriglyceridemia were more prevalent in the US population than in LAC population (31 vs. 16.1%, 16.8 vs. 8.9%, and 36.2 vs. 26.5%, respectively). However, the prevalence of low HDL-cholesterol was higher in LAC than in the US (53.3 vs. 33.7%). Conclusions: Major cardiovascular risk factors are highly prevalent in LAC region, in particular low HDL-cholesterol. In addition, marked differences do exist in this prevalence profile between LAC and the US.

We determined the fraction of mature astrocytes that proliferate in a mouse stroke model using unbiased stereology as a function of distance from the infarct edge. Cumulatively 11.1+/-1.2% of Aldh1l1(+) astrocytes within 400 mu m in the cortical penumbra incorporate BrdU in the first week following stroke, while the overall number of astrocytes does not change. The number of astrocytes proliferating fell sharply with distance with more than half of all proliferating astrocytes found within 100 mu m of the edge of the infarct.

Surfactant replacement therapy is well established, but clinical observations and in vitro experiments suggested that its efficacy may be impaired by inactivation. A new synthetic surfactant (CHF 5633), containing synthetic surfactant protein B and C analogs, has shown comparable effects on oxygenation in ventilated preterm rabbits versus Poractant alfa, but superior resistance against inactivation in vitro. We hypothesized that CHF 5633 is also resistant to inactivation by serum albumin in vivo. Methodology/Principal Findings: Nineteen preterm lambs of 127 days gestational age (term = 150 days) received CHF 5633 or Poractant alfa and were ventilated for 48 hours. Ninety minutes after birth, the animals received albumin with CHF 5633 or Poractant alfa. Animals received additional surfactant if PaO2 dropped below 100 mmHg. A pressure volume curve was done post mortem and markers of pulmonary inflammation, surfactant content and biophysiology, and lung histology were assessed. CHF 5633 treatment resulted in improved arterial pH, oxygenation and ventilation efficiency index. The survival rate was significantly higher after CHF 5633 treatment (5/7) than after Poractant alfa (1/8) after 48 hours of ventilation. Biophysical examination of the surfactant recovered from bronchoalveolar lavages revealed that films formed by CHF 5633-treated animals reached low surface tensions in a wider range of compression rates than films from Poractant alfa-treated animals.

We carried out a study to describe the characteristics of patients with carbapenemase-producing Enterobacteriaceae (CPE) and non-CPE bloodstream infection (BSI) from Latin American hospitals and to determine the clinical impact in terms of mortality and antibiotic therapy. Methods Between July 2013 and November 2014, we conducted a multicenter observational study in 11 hospitals from 7 Latin American countries (Argentina, Colombia, Ecuador, Guatemala, Mexico, Peru, Venezuela). Patients with BSI caused by Enterobacteriaceae were included and classified either as CPE or non-CPE based on detection of bla(KPC), bla(VIM), bla(IMP), bla(NDM) and bla(OXA-48) by polymerase chain reaction. Enrolled subjects were followed until discharge or death. Demographic, microbiological and clinical characteristics were collected from medical records. Both descriptive and inferential statistics were used to analyze the information. Results A total of 255 patients with Enterobacteriaceae BSI were included; CPE were identified in 53 of them. In vitro non-susceptibility to all screened antibiotics was higher in the patients with CPE BSI, remaining colistin, tigecycline and amikacin as the most active drugs. Combination therapy was significantly more frequent in the CPE BSI group (p < 0.001). The most common regimen was carbapenem + colistin or polymyxin B. The overall mortality was 37% (94/255). Overall and attributable mortality were significantly higher in patients with CPE BSI (p < 0.001); however, we found that patients with CPE BSI who received combination therapy and those who received monotherapy had similar mortality. After multivariate adjustment, CPE BSI (adjusted odds ratio [aOR] 4; 95% confidence interval [CI] 1.7-9.5; p = 0.002) and critical illness (aOR 6.5; 95% CI 3.1-13.7; p < 0.001) were independently associated with in-hospital mortality. Conclusions This study provides valuable data on the clinical characteristics and mortality risk factors in patients with CPE BSI. We determined that CPE infection is an independent mortality predictor and thus Latin American hospitals should perform campaigns on prevention and control of CPE BSI.",Article,"Villegas, M.V.; Pallares, C.J.; Escandon-Vargas, K.; Hernandez-Gomez, C.; Correa, A.; Alvarez, C.; Rosso, F.; Matta, L.; Luna, C.; Zurita, J.; Mejia-Villatoro, C.; Rodriguez-Noriega, E.; Seas, C.; Cortesia, M.; Guzman-Suarez, A.; Guzman-Blanco, M.",,RESISTANT KLEBSIELLA-PNEUMONIAE;INTENSIVE-CARE UNITS;K.-PNEUMONIAE;RISK-FACTORS;BACTEREMIA;PREDICTORS;MORTALITY;KPC;EMERGENCE;OUTCOMES,Colombia;Argentina;Ecuador;Guatemala;Mexico;Peru;Venezuela,2-s2.0-84977604914
,,,56,WOS:000312386800139,2012,Structural and Functional Insights from the Metagenome of an Acidic Hot Spring Microbial Planktonic Community in the Colombian Andes,"A taxonomic and annotated functional description of microbial life was deduced from 53 Mb of metagenomic sequence retrieved from a planktonic fraction of the Neotropical high Andean (3,973 meters above sea level) acidic hot spring El Coquito (EC). A classification of unassembled metagenomic reads using different databases showed a high proportion of Gammaproteobacteria and Alphaproteobacteria (in total read affiliation), and through taxonomic affiliation of 16S rRNA gene fragments we observed the presence of Proteobacteria, micro-algae chloroplast and Firmicutes. Reads mapped against the genomes Acidiphilium cryptum JF-5, Legionella pneumophila str. Corby and Acidithiobacillus caldus revealed the presence of transposase-like sequences, potentially involved in horizontal gene transfer. Functional annotation and hierarchical comparison with different datasets obtained by pyrosequencing in different ecosystems showed that the microbial community also contained extensive DNA repair systems, possibly to cope with ultraviolet radiation at such high altitudes. Analysis of genes involved in the nitrogen cycle indicated the presence of dissimilatory nitrate reduction to N2 (narGHI, nirS, norBCDQ and nosZ), associated with Proteobacteria-like sequences. Genes involved in the sulfur cycle (cysDN, cysNC and aprA) indicated adenylsulfate and sulfite production that were affiliated to several bacterial species. In summary, metagenomic sequence data provided insight regarding the structure and possible functions of this hot spring microbial community, describing some groups potentially involved in the nitrogen and sulfur cycling in this environment.

Invasive species modify ecosystem structure and functioning and climatic changes are likely to produce invasive species' range shifts pushing some populations into protected areas. The American Bullfrog (Lithobates catesbeianus) is one of the hundred worst invasive species in the world. Native from the southeast of USA, it has colonized more than 75% of South America where it has been reported as a highly effective predator, competitor and vector of amphibian diseases. Methodology/Principal Findings: We modeled the potential distribution of the bullfrog in its native range based on different climate models and green-house gases emission scenarios, and projected the results onto South America for the years of 2050 and 2080. We also overlaid projected models onto the South American network of protected areas. Our results indicate a slight decrease in potential suitable area for bullfrog invasion, although protected areas will become more climatically suitable. Therefore, invasion of these sites is forecasted. Conclusion/Significance: We provide new evidence supporting the vulnerability of the Atlantic Forest Biodiversity Hotspot to bullfrog invasion and call attention to optimal future climatic conditions of the Andean-Patagonian forest, eastern Paraguay, and northwestern Bolivia, where invasive populations have not been found yet. We recommend several management and policy strategies to control bullfrog invasion and argue that these would be possible if based on appropriate articulation among government agencies, NGOs, research institutions and civil society.",Article,"Nori, J.; Urbina-Cardona, J.N.; Loyola, R.D.; Lescano, J.N.; Leynaud, G.C.",,LITHOBATES-CATESBEIANUS;BIOLOGICAL INVASIONS;SPECIES DISTRIBUTIONS;NICHE;PREDICTION;POPULATIONS;AMPHIBIANS;IMPACTS;RANGES;SHIFTS,Argentina;Colombia;Brazil,2-s2.0-80053460811

In epilepsy, HFOs might reflect a mechanism of epileptic phenomena, serving as a biomarker of epileptogenesis and epileptogenicity. Despite the valuable information provided by HFOs, their correct identification is a challenging task. A comprehensive application, RIPPLELAB, was developed to facilitate the analysis of HFOs. RIPPLELAB provides a wide range of tools for HFOs manual and automatic detection and visual validation; all of them are accessible from an intuitive graphical user interface. Four methods for automated detection-as well as several options for visualization and validation of detected events-were implemented and integrated in the application. Analysis of multiple files and channels is possible, and new options can be added by users. All features and capabilities implemented in RIPPLELAB for automatic detection were tested through the analysis of simulated signals and intracranial EEG recordings from epileptic patients (n = 16; 3,471 analyzed hours). Visual validation was also tested, and detected events were classified into different categories. Unlike other available software packages for EEG analysis, RIPPLELAB uniquely provides the appropriate graphical and algorithmic environment for HFOs detection (visual and automatic) and validation, in such a way that the power of elaborated detection methods are available to a wide range of users (experts and non-experts) through the use of this application. We believe that this open-source tool will facilitate and promote the collaboration between clinical and research centers working on the HFOs field.

This paper describes the methods of data collection and various characteristics of the study sample. Methods/Principal Findings: A standardised questionnaire covering musculoskeletal symptoms, disability and potential risk factors, was used to collect information from 47 samples of nurses, office workers, and other (mostly manual) workers in 18 countries from six continents. In addition, local investigators provided data on economic aspects of employment for each occupational group. Participation exceeded 80% in 33 of the 47 occupational groups, and after pre-specified exclusions, analysis was based on 12,426 subjects (92 to 1018 per occupational group). As expected, there was high usage of computer keyboards by office workers, while nurses had the highest prevalence of heavy manual lifting in all but one country. There was substantial heterogeneity between occupational groups in economic and psychosocial aspects of work; three-to fivefold variation in awareness of someone outside work with musculoskeletal pain; and more than ten-fold variation in the prevalence of adverse health beliefs about back and arm pain, and in awareness of terms such as ""repetitive strain injury"" (RSI).

,,,53,WOS:000385505800064,2016,Outlining the Ancestry Landscape of Colombian Admixed Populations,"The ancestry of the Colombian population comprises a large number of well differentiated Native communities belonging to diverse linguistic groups. In the late fifteenth century, a process of admixture was initiated with the arrival of the Europeans, and several years later, Africans also became part of the Colombian population. Therefore, the genepool of the current Colombian population results from the admixture of Native Americans, Europeans and Africans. This admixture occurred differently in each region of the country, producing a clearly stratified population. Considering the importance of population substructure in both clinical and forensic genetics, we sought to investigate and compare patterns of genetic ancestry in Colombia by studying samples from Native and non-Native populations living in its 5 continental regions: the Andes, Caribe, Amazonia, Orinoquia, and Pacific regions. For this purpose, 46 AIM-Indels were genotyped in 761 non-related individuals from current populations. Previously published genotype data from 214 Colombian Natives from five communities were used for population comparisons. Significant differences were observed between Native and non-Native populations, among non-Native populations from different regions and among Native populations from different ethnic groups. The Pacific was the region with the highest African ancestry, Amazonia harboured the highest Native ancestry and the Andean and Orinoquian regions showed the highest proportion of European ancestry. The Andean region was further sub-divided into 6 sub-regions: North East, Central West, Central East, West, South West and South East. Among these regions, the South West region showed a significantly lower European admixture than the other regions.

We evaluated their impact on cell signaling pathways related to insulin-resistance and type 2 diabetes. Apigenin and luteolin were identified in our U-2 OS (human osteosarcoma) cell screening assay for micronutrients triggering rapid intracellular translocation of the forkhead box transcription factor O1 (FOXO1), an important mediator of insulin signal transduction. Insulin reversed the translocation of FOXO1 as shown by live cell imaging. The impact on the expression of target genes was evaluated in HepG2 (human hepatoma) cells. The mRNA-expression of the gluconeogenic enzymes phosphoenolpyruvate carboxykinase (PEPCK) and glucose-6-phosphatase (G6Pc), the lipogenic enzymes fatty-acid synthase (FASN) and acetyl-CoA-carboxylase (ACC) were down-regulated by both flavones with smaller effective dosages of apigenin than for luteolin. PKB/AKT-, PRAS40-, p70S6K-, and S6-phosphorylation was reduced by apigenin and luteolin but not that of the insulin-like growth factor receptor IGF-1R by apigenin indicating a direct inhibition of the PKB/AKT-signaling pathway distal to the IGF-1 receptor. N-acetyl-L-cysteine did not prevent FOXO1 nuclear translocation induced by apigenin and luteolin, suggesting that these flavones do not act via oxidative stress. The roles of FOXO1, FOXO3a, AKT, sirtuin1 (SIRT1), and nuclear factor (erythroid-derived2)-like2 (NRF2), investigated by siRNA knockdown, showed differential patterns of signal pathways involved and a role of NRF2 in the inhibition of gluconeogenic enzyme expression. We conclude that these flavones show an antidiabetic potential due to reduction of gluconeogenic and lipogenic capacity despite inhibition of the PKB/AKT pathway which justifies detailed investigation in vivo.",Article,"Bumke-Vogt, C.; Osterhoff, M.A.; Borchert, A.; Guzman-Perez, V.; Sarem, Z.; Birkenfeld, A.L.; Bahr, V.; Pfeiffer, A.F.H.",,RESVERATROL SUPPLEMENTATION;INSULIN SENSITIVITY;TRANSCRIPTION;PREVENTION;PHOSPHORYLATION;METABOLISM;PROTEINS;DIETS,Germany;Colombia,2-s2.0-84924634426

In this study we investigated the effect of culture conditions, i.e. submerged or semi-solid, and copper supplementation on laccase production by Trametes pubescens grown on coffee husk, soybean pod husk, or cedar sawdust. The highest specific laccase activity was achieved when the culture was conducted under submerged conditions supplemented with copper (5 mM), and using coffee husk as substrate. The crude extracts presented two laccase isoforms with molecular mass of 120 (Lac1) and 60 kDa (Lac2). Regardless of the substrate, enzymatic crude extract and purified fractions behaved similarly at different temperatures and pHs, most of them presented the maximum activity at 55 degrees C and a pH range between 2 and 3. In addition, they showed similar stability and electro-chemical properties. At optimal culture conditions laccase activity was 7.69 +/- 0.28 U mg(-1) of protein for the crude extract, and 0.08 +/- 0.001 and 2.86 +/- 0.05 U mg(-1) of protein for Lac1 and Lac2, respectively. In summary, these results show the potential of coffee husk as an important and economical growth medium to produce laccase, offering a new alternative use for this common agro-industrial byproduct.",Article,"Gonzalez, J.C.; Medina, S.C.; Rodriguez, A.; Osma, J.F.; Almeciga-Diaz, C.J.; Sanchez, O.F.",,WHITE-ROT FUNGI;SOLID-STATE FERMENTATION;PLEUROTUS-OSTREATUS;COFFEE PULP;LIGNINOLYTIC ENZYMES;PRESSURE COOKING;WOOD SAWDUST;PEROXIDASE;VERSICOLOR;COPPER,Colombia,2-s2.0-84883404936

Yet, there is lack of comparative efficacy of interventions that seem to be better than placebo among which, the clinicians must choose. Our aim was to determine the comparative effectiveness and safety of the pharmacological and nutritional interventions for reducing the duration of ADG in children. Methods Data sources included Medline, Embase, CENTRAL, CINAHL, LILACS, and Global-Health up to May 2017. Eligible trials compared zinc (ZN), vitamin A, micronutrients (MN), probiotics, prebiotics, symbiotics, racecadotril, smectite(SM), loperamide, diluted milk, lactose-free formula(LCF), or their combinations, to placebo or standard treatment (STND), or among them. Two reviewers independently performed screening, review, study selection and extraction. The primary outcome was diarrhea duration. Secondary outcomes were stool frequency at day 2, diarrhea at day 3, vomiting and side effects. We performed a random effects Bayesian network meta-analysis to combine the direct and indirect evidence for each outcome. Mean differences and odds ratio with their credible intervals(CrI) were calculated. Coherence and transitivity assumptions were assessed. Meta-regression, subgroups and sensitivity analyses were conducted to explore the impact of effect modifiers. Summary under the cumulative curve (SUCRA) values with their CrI were calculated. We assessed the evidence quality and classified the best interventions using the Grading of Recommendations, Assessment, Development & Evaluation (GRADE) approach for each paired comparison. Results A total of 174 studies (32,430 children) proved eligible. Studies were conducted in 42 countries of which most were low-and middle-income countries (LMIC). Interventions were grouped in 27 categories. Most interventions were better than STND. Reduction of diarrhea varied from 12.5 to 51.1 hours. The combinations Saccharomyces boulardii (SB)+ZN, and SM+ZN were considered the best interventions (i.e., GRADE quality of evidence: moderate to high, substantial superiority to STND, reduction in duration of 35 to 40 hours, and large SUCRA values), while symbiotics (combination of probiotics+prebiotics), ZN, loperamide and combinations ZN+MN and ZN+LCF were considered inferior to the best and better than STND [Quality: moderate to high, superior to STND, and reduction of 17 to 25 hours]. In subgroups analyses, effect of ZN was higher in LMIC and was not present in high-income countries (HIC). Vitamin A, MN, prebiotics, kaolin-pectin, and diluted milk were similar to STND [Quality: moderate to high]. The remainder of the interventions had low to very-low evidence quality. Loperamide was the only intervention with more side effects than STND [Quality: moderate]. Discussion/Conclusion Most interventions analyzed (except vitamin A, micronutrients, prebiotics, and kaolin-pectin) showed evidence of superiority to placebo in reducing the diarrhea. With moderate-to high-quality of evidence, SB+ZN and SM+ZN, demonstrated the best combination of evidence quality and magnitude of effect while symbiotics, loperamide and zinc proved being the best single interventions, and loperamide was the most unsafe. Nonetheless, the effect of zinc, SB+ZN and SM+ZN might only be applied to children in LMIC.

A healthy diet and consumption of specific food groups may decrease the risk of NCDs, however there is a lack of dietary intake data in LA countries. Objective Provide updated data on the dietary intake of key science-based selected food groups related to NCDs risk in LA countries. Design ELANS (Latin American Study of Nutrition and Health) is a multicenter cross-sectional study assessing food consumption from an urban sample between15 to 65 years old from 8 LA countries (Argentina, Brazil, Chile, Colombia, Costa Rica, Ecuador, Peru, and Venezuela). Two 24-HR were obtained from 9,218 individuals. The daily intake of 10 food groups related to NCDs risk (fruits; vegetables; legumes/beans; nuts and seeds; whole grains products; fish and seafood; yogurt; red meat; processed meats; sugar-sweetened beverages (ready-to-drink and homemade)) were assessed and compared to global recommendations. Results Only 7.2% of the overall sample reached WHO's recommendation for fruits and vegetables consumption (400 grams per day). Regarding the dietary patterns related to a reduced risk of NCDs, among the overall sample legumes and fruits were the food groups with closer intake to the recommendation, although much lower than expected (13.1% and 11.5%, respectively). Less than 3.5% of the sample met the optimal consumption level of vegetables, nuts, whole grains, fish and yogurt. Largest country-dependent differences in average daily consumption were found for legumes, nuts, fish, and yogurt. Mean consumption of SSB showed large differences between countries. Conclusion Diet intake quality is deficient for nutrient-dense food groups, suggesting a higher risk for NCDs in the urban LA region in upcoming decades.

To achieve the most suitable option for their degradation, it is necessary to implement chemical, physical and biological treatments, as well as combining procedures. Best treatment was prognosticated by Plackett-Burman Experimental Design (PB), evaluating five factors with two levels (0.25 mM or 1.0 gL(-1) glucose, 1.0 or 2.0 mM CuSO4, 0.1 or 0.2 mM ABTS [2, 20-azino-bis(3-ethylbenzothiazoline-6-sulphonic acid)], pH 4.5 +/- 0.2 or 7.0 +/- 0.2 and 30 or 90 day incubation), which was reproduced for 150 days. Therefore, PB identified a sequential treatment (plasma followed by fungus) for partial LDPE biodeterioration. Sheets were pretreated with glow discharge plasma (O-2, 3.0 x 10(-2) mbar, 600 V, 6 min.), followed by Pleurotus ostreatus biodeterioration. Fungus growth, colonization percentage, and pigment generation followed. Laccase (Lac), manganese peroxidase (MnP) and lignin peroxidase (LiP) activities were appraised. Additionally, contact angle (CA), functional group presence and changes and carbonyl and vinyl indices (Fourier transformed infrared spectroscopy) were evaluated. LDPE surface changes were assessed by Young's modulus, yield strength, scanning electronic microscopy (SEM), Fourier transformed infrared spectroscopy (FTIR) and atomic force microscopy (AFM). Plasma discharge increased hydrophilicity, decreasing CA by 76.57% and increasing surface roughness by 99.81%. P. ostreatus colonization was 88.72% in 150 days in comparison with untreated LDPE (45.55%). After this treatment carbonyl groups (C = O), C = C insaturations, high hydrophilicity CA (16 +/- 4) degrees, and low surface roughness (7 +/- 2) nm were observed. However, the highest Lac and LiP activities were detected after 30 days (Lac: 2.817 U Lac g(-1) and LiP: 70.755 U LiP g(-1)). In addition, highest MnP activity was observed at day 120 (1.097 U MnP g(-1)) only for P. ostreatus treated LDPE. Plasma favored P. ostreatus adsorption, adherence, growth and colonization (88.72%), as well as partial LDPE biodeterioration, supported by increased hydrophilicity and presence of specific functional chemical groups.

In Colombia, data from 1980s described that HBV and HDV infection are important causes of hepatitis, but little is known about HCV infection. The aim of this study was to determine the currently frequency of HBV, HCV and HDV in four different Colombian regions. Methodology/Principal Findings: This study was conducted in 697 habitants from 4 Colombian departments: Amazonas, Choco, Magdalena and San Andres Islands. Epidemiological data were obtained from an interview applied to each individual aiming to evaluate risk factors related to HBV, HCV or HDV infections. All samples were tested for HBsAg, anti-HBc, anti-HBs and anti-HCV markers. Samples that were positive to HBsAg and/or anti-HBc were tested to anti-HDV. Concerning the geographical origin of the samples, the three HBV markers showed a statistically significant difference: HBsAg (p = 0.033) and anti-HBc (p < 0.001) were more frequent in Amazonas and Magdalena departments. Isolated anti-HBs (a marker of previous vaccination) frequencies were: Choco (53.26%), Amazonas (32.88%), Magdalena (17.0%) and San Andres (15.33%) p < 0.001. Prevalence of anti-HBc increased with age; HBsAg varied from 1.97 to 8.39% (p = 0.033). Amazonas department showed the highest frequency for anti-HCV marker (5.68%), while the lowest frequency was found in San Andres Island (0.66%). Anti-HDV was found in 9 (5.20%) out of 173 anti-HBc and/or HBsAg positive samples, 8 of them from the Amazonas region and 1 from them Magdalena department. Conclusions/Significance: In conclusion, HBV, HCV and HDV infections are detected throughout Colombia in frequency levels that would place some areas as hyperendemic for HBV, especially those found in Amazonas and Magdalena departments. Novel strategies to increase HBV immunization in the rural population and to strengthen HCV surveillance are reinforced by these results.",Article,"Alvarado-Mora, M.V.; Fernandez, M.F.G.; Gomes-Gouvea, M.S.; Neto, R.S.D.; Carrilho, F.J.; Pinho, J.R.R.",,LATIN-AMERICA;SOUTH-AMERICA;MOLECULAR CHARACTERIZATION;SANTA-MARTA;GENOTYPE-I;INFECTION;DISEASE;VENEZUELA;SEQUENCE;INDIANS,Brazil;Colombia,2-s2.0-79955758226

Two large deletions, del(GJB6-D13S1830) and del(GJB6-D13S1854), which truncate GJB6 (connexin 30), cause hearing loss in individuals homozygous, or compound heterozygous for these deletions or one such deletion and a mutation in GJB2. Recently, we have demonstrated that the del(GJB6-D13S1830) deletion contributes to hearing loss due to an allele-specific lack of GJB2 mRNA expression and not as a result of digenic inheritance, as was postulated earlier. In the current study we investigated the smaller del(GJB6-D13S1854) deletion, which disrupts the expression of GJB2 at the transcriptional level in a manner similar to the more common del(GJB6-D13S1830) deletion. Interestingly, in the presence of this deletion, GJB2 expression remains minimally but reproducibly present. The relative allele-specific expression of GJB2 was assessed by reverse-transcriptase PCR and restriction digestions in three probands who were compound heterozygous for a GJB2 mutation and del(GJB6-D13S1854). Each individual carried a different sequence variant in GJB2. All three individuals expressed the mutated GJB2 allele in trans with del(GJB6-D13S1854), but expression of the GJB2 allele in cis with the deletion was almost absent. Our study clearly corroborates the hypothesis that the del(GJB6-D13S1854), similar to the larger and more common del(GJB6-D13S1830), removes (a) putative cis-regulatory element(s) upstream of GJB6 and narrows down the region of location.",Article,"Rodriguez-Paris, J.; Tamayo, M.L.; Gelvez, N.; Schrijver, I.",,NONSYNDROMIC HEARING IMPAIRMENT;CONNEXIN 26 GENE;GAP-JUNCTIONS;MUTATION;MULTICENTER;PCR,United States;Colombia,2-s2.0-79959678741

The limits of species and genera in the Characidae family are controversial due to its uncertain phylogenetic relationships, high level of morphological homoplasy and the use of ambiguous morphological characters for descriptions. Here we establish species boundaries for Bryconamericus, Hemibrycon, Knodus and Eretmobrycon (Stevardiinae: Characidae), previously diagnosed with morphology, using three different barcoding approaches (GMYC, PTP, ABGD). Results revealed that species delimitation was successful by the use of a single-gene approach and by following a workflow in the context of integrative taxonomy, making evident problems and mistakes in the cataloging of Characidae species. Hence, it was possible to infer boundaries at genus level for clusters in the trees (GMYC and PTP) and automatic partitions (ABGD) which were consistent with some of recent taxonomic changes proposed in Characidae. We found that discordance cases between methods were linked to limitations of the methods and associated to putative species cluster closely related, some historically problematic in their diagnosis and identification. Furthermore, we suggested taxonomic changes and possibly new species, revealing a high degree of hidden diversity. Finally, we propose a workflow as a fast, accurate and objective way to delimit species from mitochondrial DNA sequences and to help clarify the classification of this group.",Article,"Garcia-Melo, J.E.; Oliveira, C.; Silva, G.J.D.; Ochoa-Orrego, L.E.; Pereira, L.H.G.; Maldonado-Ocampo, J.A.",,GENUS BRYCONAMERICUS TELEOSTEI;CHARACIFORMES CHARACIDAE;MAGDALENA BASIN;RIVER;OSTARIOPHYSI;PHYLOGENY;REVISION;MODELS;CLADE;FISH,Colombia;Brazil,2-s2.0-85066814458

Fungal laccases have generated a growing interest due to their biotechnological potential applications, such as lignocellulosic material delignification, biopulping and biobleaching, wastewater treatment, and transformation of toxic organic pollutants. In this work we selected fungal genes encoding for laccase enzymes GlLCC1 in Ganoderma lucidum and POXA 1B in Pleurotus ostreatus. These genes were optimized for codon use, GC content, and regions generating secondary structures. Laccase proposed computational models, and their interaction with ABTS [2, 2'-azino-bis(3-ethylbenzothiazoline-6-sulphonic acid)] substrate was evaluated by molecular docking. Synthetic genes were cloned under the control of Pichia pastoris glyceraldehyde-3-phosphate dehydrogenase (GAP) constitutive promoter. P. pastoris X-33 was transformed with pGAPZ alpha A-LaccGluc-Stop and pGAPZ alpha A-LaccPost-Stop constructs. Optimization reduced GC content by 47 and 49% for LaccGluc-Stop and LaccPost-Stop genes, respectively. A codon adaptation index of 0.84 was obtained for both genes. 3D structure analysis using SuperPose revealed LaccGluc-Stop is similar to the laccase crystallographic structure 1GYC of Trametes versicolor. Interaction analysis of the 3D models validated through ABTS, demonstrated higher substrate affinity for LaccPost-Stop, in agreement with our experimental results with enzymatic activities of 451.08 +/- 6.46 UL-1 compared to activities of 0.13 +/- 0.028 UL-1 for LaccGluc-Stop. This study demonstrated that G. lucidum GlLCC1 and P. ostreatus POXA 1B gene optimization resulted in constitutive gene expression under GAP promoter and alpha-factor leader in P. pastoris.

The clinical course is highly variable among individuals and there is poor understanding of the factors that drive an aggressive vs an indolent course. Methods A convenience cohort of 339 affected subjects with papillomas positive for only HPV6 or HPV11 and clinical course data available for 1 year or more, from a large multicenter international study were included. Exploratory data analysis was conducted followed by inferential analyses with frequentist and Bayesian statistics. Results We examined 339 subjects: 82% were diagnosed prior to the age of 18 years, 65% were infected with HPV6, and 69% had an aggressive clinical course. When comparing age at diagnosis with clinical course, the probability of aggressiveness is high for children under five years of age then drops rapidly. For patients diagnosed after the age of 10 years, an indolent course is more common. After accounting for confounding between HPV11 and young age, HPV type was minimally associated with aggressiveness. Fast and Frugal Trees (FFTs) were utilized to determine which algorithms yield the highest accuracy to classify patients as having an indolent or aggressive clinical course and consistently created a branch for diagnostic age at similar to 5 years old.

To date, research has provided limited data on the possible association between an active lifestyle and a healthy composition of human microbiota. This review was aimed to summarize the results of human studies comparing the microbiome of healthy individuals with different physical activity amounts. Methods We searched Medline/Ovid, NIH/PubMed, and Academic Search Complete between August-October 2020. Inclusion criteria comprised: (a) cross-sectional studies focused on comparing gut microbiome among subjects with different physical activity levels; (b) studies describing human gut microbiome responses to any type of exercise stimulus; (c) studies containing healthy adult women and men. We excluded studies containing diet modifications, probiotic or prebiotic consumption, as well as studies focused on diabetes, hypertension, cancer, hormonal dysfunction. Methodological quality and risk of bias for each study were assessed using the Risk Of Bias In Non-randomized Studies-of Interventions tool. The results from cross-sectional and longitudinal studies are shown independently. Results A total of 17 articles were eligible for inclusion: ten cross-sectional and seven longitudinal studies. Main outcomes vary significantly according to physical activity amounts in longitudinal studies. We identified discrete changes in diversity indexes and relative abundance of certain bacteria in active people. Conclusion As literature in this field is rapidly growing, it is important that studies incorporate diverse methods to evaluate other aspects related to active lifestyles such as sleep and dietary patterns.

We found that a hydrolysis product of benzyl glucosinolate-the benzyl isothiocyanate (BITC)modulates the intracellular localization of the transcription factor Forkhead box O 1 (FOXO1). FoxO transcription factors can antagonize insulin effects and trigger a variety of cellular processes involved in tumor suppression, longevity, development and metabolism. The current study evaluated the ability of BITC-extracted as intact glucosinolate from nasturtium and hydrolyzed with myrosinase-to modulate i) the insulin-signaling pathway, ii) the intracellular localization of FOXO1 and, iii) the expression of proteins involved in gluconeogenesis, antioxidant response and detoxification. Stably transfected human osteosarcoma cells (U-2 OS) with constitutive expression of FOXO1 protein labeled with GFP (green fluorescent protein) were used to evaluate the effect of BITC on FOXO1. Human hepatoma HepG2 cell cultures were selected to evaluate the effect on gluconeogenic, antioxidant and detoxification genes and protein expression. BITC reduced the phosphorylation of protein kinase B (AKT/PKB) and FOXO1; promoted FOXO1 translocation from cytoplasm into the nucleus antagonizing the insulin effect; was able to down-regulate the gene and protein expression of gluconeogenic enzymes; and induced the gene expression of antioxidant and detoxification enzymes. Knockdown analyses with specific siRNAs showed that the expression of gluconeogenic genes was dependent on nuclear factor (erythroid derived)-like2 (NRF2) and independent of FOXO1, AKT and NAD-dependent deacetylase sirtuin-1 (SIRT1).

This study aimed to estimate the prevalence of Chagas disease in Colombia. Methods A systematic literature review and meta-analysis was conducted to select all observational studies reporting the prevalence of Chagas disease in Colombia, based on serological diagnosis in participants of any age and published between January 2007 and November 2017. Pooled estimates and 95% confidence intervals (95% CIs) were calculated using random effects models. In addition, the 12 statistic was calculated. Results The literature search yielded a total of 1,510 studies; sixteen articles with relevant prevalence data were included in the systematic review. Of these, only 12 articles were included for entry in the meta-analysis. The pooled prevalence of Chagas disease across studies was 2.0% (95% CI: 1.0-4.0).

The highest pooled prevalences were found in the adult population (3.0%, 95% CI: 1.0-4.0), pregnant women (3.0%, 95% CI: 3.0-4.0) and the Orinoco region (7.0%, 95% CI: 2.2-12.6). Conclusions The results indicate that the T. cruzi-infected population is aging, the adult population, pregnant women and that the Orinoco region (department of Casanare) have the highest prevalences.

Halotolerant microorganisms, such as Tistlia consotensis, have to cope with continuous fluctuations in the salinity of their natural environments which require effective adaptation strategies against salt stress. Changes of extracellular protein profiles from Tistlia consotensis in conditions of low and high salinities were monitored by proteogenomics using a bacterial draft genome. At low salinity, we detected greater amounts of the HpnM protein which is involved in the biosynthesis of hopanoids. This may represent a novel, and previously unreported, strategy by halotolerant microorganisms to prevent the entry of water into the cell under conditions of low salinity. At high salinity, proteins associated with osmosensing, exclusion of Na+ and transport of compatible solutes, such as glycine betaine or proline are abundant. We also found that, probably in response to the high salt concentration, T. consotensis activated the synthesis of flagella and triggered a chemotactic response neither of which were observed at the salt concentration which is optimal for growth. Our study demonstrates that the exoproteome is an appropriate indicator of adaptive response of T. consotensis to changes in salinity because it allowed the identification of key proteins within its osmoadaptive mechanism that had not previously been detected in its cell proteome.",Article,"Rubiano-Labrador, C.; Bland, C.; Miotello, G.; Armengaud, J.; Baena, S.",,MODERATELY HALOPHILIC BACTERIUM;PROTEIN SECRETION;MASS-SPECTROMETRY;LIGAND-BINDING;PROTEOMICS;TOLERANCE;BIOSYNTHESIS;TRANSDUCTION;PEPTIDES;GENOMICS,Colombia;France,2-s2.0-84942694095

Low reliability and validity of the questionnaires has limited the capacity to examine associations between PA and health. The purpose of this study was to compare self-reported and accelerometer-measured PA and SB and their associations with body composition in Latin American countries. Methods Data were obtained from the Latin American Study of Nutrition and Health (aged 15-65 years), collected from September 2014 to February 2015. PA and SB were assessed using the International Physical Activity Questionnaire (long version) and the Actigraph GT3X+ accelerometer. Outcomes of interest included: body mass index (BMI), waist (WC) and neck circumference (NC). We used the Pearson and intraclass correlation coefficient, Bland-Altman plots, and multilevel linear regression models. Results Mean moderate-to-vigorous physical activity (MVPA) by accelerometer and IPAQ were 34.4 min/day (95% CI: 33.4 to 35.4) and 45.6 min/day (95% CI: 43.2 to 48.1), respectively. For SB (accelerometer and IPAQ) the means were 573.1 (95% CI: 568.2 to 577.9) and 231.9 min/day (95% CI: 225.5 to 238.3). MVPA, measured by the accelerometer was negatively associated with BMI (beta = -1.95; 95% CI: -2.83 to -1.08), WC (beta = -5.04; 95% CI: -7.18 to -2.89) and NC (beta = -1.21; 95% CI: -1.79 to -0.63). The MVPA estimated through IPAQ was not significantly associated with any of the three outcome variables. SB, measured by the accelerometer, was positively associated with BMI (beta = 0.26; 95% CI: 0.08 to 0.44) and WC (beta = 0.48; 95% CI: 0.13 to 0.91). SB estimated through IPAQ was positively associated with NC only. Conclusions Low correlation coefficients were observed for accelerometer-derived and IPAQ-reported estimates of PA and SB. Caution is advised when making comparisons between accelerometer-measured and self-reported PA and SB. Further, studies examining associations between movement and health should discuss the impact of PA and SB measurement methodology on the results obtained.",Article,"Ferrari, G.L.D.; Kovalskys, I.; Fisberg, M.; Gomez, G.; Rigotti, A.; Sanabria, L.Y.C.; Garcia, M.C.Y.; Torres, R.G.P.; Herrera-Cuenca, M.; Zimberg, I.Z.; Guajardo, V.; Pratt, M.; Pires, C.A.M.; Colley, R.C.; Sole, D.",,ACTIVITY QUESTIONNAIRE;DOSE-RESPONSE;TIME;ADULTS;RISK,Chile;Brazil;Argentina;Costa Rica;Colombia;Ecuador;Peru;Venezuela;United States;Portugal;Canada,2-s2.0-85084042747

Reduction of inflammation, reduction of glycosaminoglycan (GAG) storage, and improvement in the skeletal phenotype were shown. Herein, we evaluate the long-term safety and therapeutic effects of PPS in a large animal model of a different MPS type, MPS I dogs. We focused on the arterial phenotype since this is one of the most consistent and clinically significant features of the model. Methodology/Principal Findings MPS I dogs were treated with daily oral or biweekly subcutaneous (subQ) PPS at a human equivalent dose of 1.6 mg/kg for 17 and 12 months, respectively. Safety parameters were assessed at 6 months and at the end of the study. Following treatment, cytokine and GAG levels were determined in fluids and tissues. Assessments of the aorta and carotid arteries also were performed. No drug-related increases in liver enzymes, coagulation factors, or other adverse effects were observed. Significantly reduced IL-8 and TNF-alpha were found in urine and cerebrospinal fluid (CSF). GAG reduction was observed in urine and tissues. Increases in the luminal openings and reduction of the intimal media thickening occurred in the carotids and aortas of PPS-treated animals, along with a reduction of storage vacuoles. These results were correlated with a reduction of GAG storage, reduction of clusterin 1 staining, and improved elastin integrity. No significant changes in the spines of the treated animals were observed. Conclusions PPS treatment led to reductions of pro-inflammatory cytokines and GAG storage in urine and tissues of MPS I dogs, which were most evident after subQ administration. SubQ administration also led to significant cytokine reductions in the CSF. Both treatment groups exhibited markedly reduced carotid and aortic inflammation, increased vessel integrity, and improved histopathology. We conclude that PPS may be a safe and useful therapy for MPS I, either as an adjunct or as a stand-alone treatment that reduces inflammation and GAG storage.",Article,"Simonaro, C.M.; Tomatsu, S.; Sikora, T.; Kubaski, F.; Frohbergh, M.; Guevara, J.M.; Wang, R.Y.; Vera, M.; Kang, J.L.; Smith, L.J.; Schuchman, E.H.; Haskins, M.E.",,ENZYME REPLACEMENT THERAPY;CREUTZFELDT-JAKOB-DISEASE;CELL TRANSPLANTATION;HURLER-SYNDROME;MPS-I;STORAGE;OSTEOARTHRITIS;INVOLVEMENT;PROGRESSION;INFUSION,United States;Colombia,2-s2.0-84963813656

Methods and Findings: WHO World Mental Health (WMH) Surveys carried out in 22 countries worldwide (n = 51,344 respondents, 72.0% response rate). We assessed nine common mental conditions with the WHO Composite International Diagnostic Interview (CIDI), and ten chronic physical with a checklist. A visual analog scale (VAS) score (0, worst to 100, best) measured perceived health in the previous 30 days. Disability was assessed using a modified WHO Disability Assessment Schedule (WHODAS), including: cognition, mobility, self-care, getting along, role functioning (life activities), family burden, stigma, and discrimination. Path analysis was used to estimate total effects of conditions on perceived health VAS and their separate direct and indirect (through the WHODAS dimensions) effects. Twelve-month prevalence was 14.4% for any mental and 51.4% for any physical condition. 31.7% of respondents reported difficulties in role functioning, 11.4% in mobility, 8.3% in stigma, 8.1% in family burden and 6.9% in cognition. Other difficulties were much less common. Mean VAS score was 81.0 (SD = 0.1). Decrements in VAS scores were highest for neurological conditions (9.8), depression (8.2) and bipolar disorder (8.1). Across conditions, 36.8% (IQR: 31.2-51.5%) of the total decrement in perceived health associated with the condition were mediated by WHODAS disabilities (significant for 17 of 19 conditions). Role functioning was the dominant mediator for both mental and physical conditions. Stigma and family burden were also important mediators for mental conditions, and mobility for physical conditions. Conclusions: More than a third of the decrement in perceived health associated with common conditions is mediated by disability. Although the decrement is similar for physical and mental conditions, the pattern of mediation is different.

The aims of the study were to determine the prevalence and changes in primary levofloxacin resistance related to H. pylori gyrA sequences. The study utilized H. pylori strains isolated from patients undergoing gastroscopy in Bogota, Colombia from 2009 to 2014. Levofloxacin susceptibility was assessed by agar dilution. Mutations in gyrA sequences affecting the quinolone resistance-determining region (QRDR) were evaluated by direct sequencing. Overall, the mean prevalence of primary levofloxacin resistance was 18.2% (80 of 439 samples). Resistance increased from 11.8%(12/102) in 2009 to 27.3% (21/77) in 2014 (p = 0.001). gyrA mutations in levofloxacin resistant strains were present in QRDR positions 87 and 91. The most common mutation was N87I (43.8%, 35/80) followed by D91N (28.8%, 23/80) and N87K (11.3%, 9/80). Levofloxacin resistance increased markedly in Colombia during the six-year study period.

,,,22,WOS:000277771600018,2010,Distamycin A Inhibits HMGA1-Binding to the P-Selectin Promoter and Attenuates Lung and Liver Inflammation during Murine Endotoxemia,"Background: The architectural transcription factor High Mobility Group-A1 (HMGA1) binds to the minor groove of AT-rich DNA and forms transcription factor complexes (""enhanceosomes'') that upregulate expression of select genes within the inflammatory cascade during critical illness syndromes such as acute lung injury (ALI). AT-rich regions of DNA surround transcription factor binding sites in genes critical for the inflammatory response. Minor groove binding drugs (MGBs), such as Distamycin A (Dist A), interfere with AT-rich region DNA binding in a sequence and conformation-specific manner, and HMGA1 is one of the few transcription factors whose binding is inhibited by MGBs. Objectives: To determine whether MGBs exert beneficial effects during endotoxemia through attenuating tissue inflammation via interfering with HMGA1-DNA binding and modulating expression of adhesion molecules. Methodology/Principal Findings: Administration of Dist A significantly decreased lung and liver inflammation during murine endotoxemia. In intravital microscopy studies, Dist A attenuated neutrophil-endothelial interactions in vivo following an inflammatory stimulus. Endotoxin induction of P-selectin expression in lung and liver tissue and promoter activity in endothelial cells was significantly reduced by Dist A, while E-selectin induction was not significantly affected. Moreover, Dist A disrupted formation of an inducible complex containing NF-kappa B that binds an AT-rich region of the P-selectin promoter. Transfection studies demonstrated a critical role for HMGA1 in facilitating cytokine and NF-kappa B induction of P-selectin promoter activity, and Dist A inhibited binding of HMGA1 to this AT-rich region of the P-selectin promoter in vivo. Conclusions/Significance: We describe a novel targeted approach in modulating lung and liver inflammation in vivo during murine endotoxemia through decreasing binding of HMGA1 to a distinct AT-rich region of the P-selectin promoter.

The aim of this study was to investigate the role of RAD51B variants in breast cancer predisposition, particularly in the context of familial breast cancer in Finland. We sequenced the coding region of RAD51B in 168 Finnish breast cancer patients from the Helsinki region for identification of possible recurrent founder mutations. In addition, we studied the known rs999737, rs2588809, and rs1314913 SNPs and RAD51B haplotypes in 44,791 breast cancer cases and 43,583 controls from 40 studies participating in the Breast Cancer Association Consortium (BCAC) that were genotyped on a custom chip (iCOGS). We identified one putatively pathogenic missense mutation c.541C>T among the Finnish cancer patients and subsequently genotyped the mutation in additional breast cancer cases (n = 5259) and population controls (n = 3586) from Finland and Belarus. No significant association with breast cancer risk was seen in the meta-analysis of the Finnish datasets or in the large BCAC dataset. The association with previously identified risk variants rs999737, rs2588809, and rs1314913 was replicated among all breast cancer cases and also among familial cases in the BCAC dataset. The most significant association was observed for the haplotype carrying the risk-alleles of all the three SNPs both among all cases (odds ratio (OR): 1.15, 95% confidence interval (CI): 1.11-1.19, P = 8.88 x 10(-16)) and among familial cases (OR: 1.24, 95% CI: 1.16-1.32, P = 6.19 x 10(-11)), compared to the haplotype with the respective protective alleles.

Among arachnids, autotomy has been observed in harvestmen, mites, and spiders, always involving the loss of legs. Autotomy of the opisthosoma (abdomen) was recently reported in a single species of the Neotropical buthid scorpion genus Ananteris Thorell, 1891, but few details were revealed. Based on observations in the field and laboratory, examination of material in museum collections, and scanning electron microscopy, we document autotomy of the metasoma (the hind part of the opisthosoma, or 'tail') in fourteen species of Ananteris. Autotomy is more common in males than females, and has not been observed in juveniles. When the scorpion is held by the metasoma, it is voluntarily severed at the joints between metasomal segments I and II, II and III, or III and IV, allowing the scorpion to escape. After detachment, the severed metasoma moves (twitches) automatically, much like the severed tail of a lizard or the severed leg of a spider, and reacts to contact, even attempting to sting. The severed surface heals rapidly, scar tissue forming in five days. The lost metasomal segments and telson cannot be regenerated. Autotomy of the metasoma and telson results in permanent loss of the posterior part of the scorpion's digestive system (the anus is situated posteriorly on metasomal segment V) and the ability to inject venom by stinging. After autotomy, scorpions do not defecate and can only capture small prey items. However, males can survive and mate successfully for up to eight months in the laboratory. In spite of diminished predation ability after autotomy, survival allows males to reproduce. Autotomy in Ananteris therefore appears to be an effective, adaptive, anti-predation escape mechanism.",Article,"Mattoni, C.I.; Garcia-Hernandez, S.; Botero-Trujillo, R.; Ochoa, J.A.; Ojanguren-Affilastro, A.A.; Pinto-Da-Rocha, R.; Prendini, L.",,LIGHT;MICROANANTERIS;LOURENCO;URODACUS;THORELL;BRAZIL,Argentina;Colombia;Peru;Brazil;United States,2-s2.0-84940365968

Studies on tolerance during embryological stages are rare, but differential effects of desiccation and freezing on different developmental stages have been reported, as well as dose-dependent effect of gamma irradiation on tardigrade embryos. Here, we report a study evaluating the tolerance of eggs from the eutardigrade Milnesium cf. tardigradum to three doses of gamma radiation (50, 200 and 500 Gy) at the early, middle, and late stage of development. We found that embryos of the middle and late developmental stages were tolerant to all doses, while eggs in the early developmental stage were tolerant only to a dose of 50 Gy, and showed a declining survival with higher dose. We also observed a delay in development of irradiated eggs, suggesting that periods of DNA repair might have taken place after irradiation induced damage. The delay was independent of dose for eggs irradiated in the middle and late stage, possibly indicating a fixed developmental schedule for repair after induced damage. These results show that the tolerance to radiation in tardigrade eggs changes in the course of their development. The mechanisms behind this pattern are unknown, but may relate to changes in mitotic activities over the embryogenesis and/or to activation of response mechanisms to damaged DNA in the course of development.",Article,"Beltran-Pardo, E.; Jonsson, K.I.; Wojcik, A.; Haghdoost, S.; Harms-Ringdahl, M.; Bermudez-Cruz, R.M.; Villegas, J.E.B.",,HYPSIBIUS-DUJARDINI;DNA-DAMAGE;HEAT-SHOCK;TOLERANCE;RESISTANCE;STRESS;DESICCATION;SPACE;HSP70,Colombia;Sweden;Mexico,2-s2.0-84883632839

Such diversity is likely to be promoted by plant specialization, associated with the occurrence of a mosaic of landscape units. Here, we integrate ecological and phylogenetic data at different spatial scales to assess the importance of habitat specialization in driving compositional and phylogenetic variation across the Amazonian forest. To do so, we evaluated patterns of floristic dissimilarity and phylogenetic turnover, habitat association and phylogenetic structure in three different landscape units occurring in terra firme (Hilly and Terrace) and flooded forests (Igapo). We established two 1-ha tree plots in each of these landscape units at the Caparu Biological Station, SW Colombia, and measured edaphic, topographic and light variables. At large spatial scales, terra firme forests exhibited higher levels of species diversity and phylodiversity than flooded forests. These two types of forests showed conspicuous differences in species and phylogenetic composition, suggesting that environmental sorting due to flood is important, and can go beyond the species level. At a local level, landscape units showed floristic divergence, driven both by geographical distance and by edaphic specialization. In terms of phylogenetic structure, Igapo forests showed phylogenetic clustering, whereas Hilly and Terrace forests showed phylogenetic evenness. Within plots, however, local communities did not show any particular trend. Overall, our findings suggest that flooded forests, characterized by stressful environments, impose limits to species occurrence, whereas terra firme forests, more environmentally heterogeneous, are likely to provide a wider range of ecological conditions and therefore to bear higher diversity. Thus, Amazonia should be considered as a mosaic of landscape units, where the strength of habitat association depends upon their environmental properties.",Article,"Umana, M.N.; Norden, N.; Cano, A.; Stevenson, P.R.",,BETA-DIVERSITY;FLORISTIC COMPOSITION;FUNCTIONAL TRAITS;FOREST;PATTERNS;LIGHT;REGENERATION;COEXISTENCE;COMPETITION;TOLERANCE,Colombia,2-s2.0-84866513609

In the present study, we characterized the EVs released by DENV-2 infected U937 macrophage cell line and evaluated the changes in the physiology and integrity of the EA.hy926 endothelial cells exposed to them. U937 macrophages were infected, supernatants were collected, and EVs were purified and characterized. Then, polarized endothelial EA.hy926 cells were exposed to the EVs for 24 h, and the transendothelial electrical resistance (TEER), monolayer permeability, and the expression of tight junction and adhesion proteins and cytokines were evaluated. The isolated EVs from infected macrophages corresponded to exosomes and apoptotic bodies, which contained the viral NS3 protein and different miRs, among other products. Exposure of EA.hy926 cells to EVs induced an increase in TEER, as well as changes in the expression of VE-cadherin and ICAM in addition leads to an increase in TNF-alpha, IP-10, IL-10, RANTES, and MCP-1 secretion.

Rotavirus (RV) memory B cells (mBc) are enriched in IgM(+) and CD27(-) subpopulations, which are associated with autoimmune diseases pathogenesis. In patients with autoimmune diseases treated with Rituximab (RTX), some autoantibodies (auto-Abs) decrease after treatment, but other auto-Abs and pathogen-specific IgG Abs remain unchanged. Thus, maintenance of autoimmune and pathogen-specific serological memory may depend on the type of antigen and/or Ab isotype evaluated. Antigen-specific mBc and antigen-specific Abs of different isotypes have not been simultaneously assessed in patients after RTX treatment. To study the relationship between mBc subpopulations and serological memory we characterized total, RV- and tetanus toxoid (TT)specific mBc by flow cytometry in patients with autoimmune diseases before and after treatment with RTX. We also measured total, RV- and TT-Abs, and some auto-Abs by kinetic nephelometry, ELISA, and EliA tests, respectively. Minor differences were observed between the relative frequencies of RV-mBc in healthy controls and patients with autoimmune disease. After RTX treatment, naive Bc and total, RV- and TT-specific mBc [IgM(+), switched (IgA(+)/IgG(+)), IgM(+) only, IgD(+) only, and CD27(-) (IgA(+)/IgG(+)/IgM(+))] were significantly diminished. An important decrease in total plasma IgM and minor decreases in total IgG and IgA levels were also observed. IgM rheumatoid factor, IgG anti-CCP, and IgG anti-dsDNA were significantly diminished. In contrast, RV-IgA, RV-IgG and RV-IgG1, and TT-IgG titers remained stable. In conclusion, in patients with autoimmunity, serological memory against RV and TT seem to be maintained by long-lived plasma cells, unaffected by RTX, and an important proportion of total IgM and serological memory against some auto-antigens seem to be maintained by short-lived plasma cells, dependent on mBc precursors depleted by RTX.",Article,"Herrera, D.; Rojas, O.L.; Duarte-Rey, C.; Mantilla, R.D.; Angel, J.; Franco, M.A.",,SYSTEMIC-LUPUS-ERYTHEMATOSUS;AUTOREACTIVE PLASMA-CELLS;AMERICAN-COLLEGE;CITRULLINATED PROTEINS;RHEUMATOID-ARTHRITIS;IMMUNOLOGICAL MEMORY;ANTIBODY;BLOOD;MAINTENANCE;IMMUNITY,Colombia,2-s2.0-84901285765

The molecular profile of breast cancer has been widely described in non-Hispanic Whites but equivalent knowledge is lacking in Hispanic/Latinas. We have previously reported that the most prevalent breast cancer intrinsic subtype in Colombian women was Luminal B as defined by St. Gallen 2013 criteria. In this study we explored ancestry-associated differences in molecular profiles of Luminal B tumors among these highly admixed women. Methods We performed whole-transcriptome RNA-seq analysis in 42 Luminal tumors (21 Luminal A and 21 Luminal B) from Colombian women. Genetic ancestry was estimated from a panel of 80 ancestry-informative markers (AIM). We categorized patients according to Luminal subtype and to the proportion of European and Indigenous American ancestry and performed differential expression analysis comparing Luminal B against Luminal A tumors according to the assigned ancestry groups. Results We found 5 genes potentially modulated by genetic ancestry: ERBB2 (log2FC = 2.367, padj<0.01), GRB7 (log2FC = 2.327, padj<0.01), GSDMB (log2FC = 1.723, padj<0.01, MIEN1 (log2FC = 2.195, padj<0.01 and ONECUT2 (log2FC = 2.204, padj<0.01). In the replication set we found a statistical significant association between ERBB2 expression with Indigenous American ancestry (p = 0.02, B = 3.11). This association was not biased by the distribution of HER2+ tumors among the groups analyzed. Conclusions Our results suggest that genetic ancestry in Hispanic/Latina women might modify ERBB2 gene expression in Luminal tumors. Further analyses are needed to confirm these findings and explore their prognostic value.",Article,"Serrano-Gomez, S.J.; Sanabria-Salas, M.A.C.; Garay, J.; Baddoo, M.C.; Hernandez-Suarez, G.; Mejia, J.C.; Garcia, O.; Miele, L.; Fejerman, L.; Zabaleta, J.",,CANCER INTRINSIC SUBTYPES;GRB7;HER2;IMMUNOHISTOCHEMISTRY;CHEMOTHERAPY;CLASSIFICATION;IDENTIFICATION;POLYMORPHISMS;ASSOCIATION;MANAGEMENT,Colombia;United States,2-s2.0-85029029414

To fine-map this locus, we genotyped 92 SNPs in a 900kb region (120,505,799-121,481,132) flanking rs11249433 in 45,276 breast cancer cases and 48,998 controls of European, Asian and African ancestry from 50 studies in the Breast Cancer Association Consortium. Genotyping was done using iCOGS, a custom-built array. Due to the complicated nature of the region on chr1p11.2: 120,300,000-120,505,798, that lies near the centromere and contains seven duplicated genomic segments, we restricted analyses to 429 SNPs excluding the duplicated regions (42 genotyped and 387 imputed). Perallelic associations with breast cancer risk were estimated using logistic regression models adjusting for study and ancestry-specific principal components. The strongest association observed was with the original identified index SNP rs11249433 (minor allele frequency (MAF) 0.402; per-allele odds ratio (OR) = 1.10, 95% confidence interval (CI) 1.08-1.13, P = 1.49 x 10(-21)). The association for rs11249433 was limited to ER-positive breast cancers (test for heterogeneity P <= 8.41 x 10(-5)). Additional analyses by other tumor characteristics showed stronger associations with moderately/well differentiated tumors and tumors of lobular histology. Although no significant eQTL associations were observed, in silico analyses showed that rs11249433 was located in a region that is likely a weak enhancer/promoter.

The objective was to examine the relationship between gait speed (GS) and body mass index (BMI) in men and women aged 75 years and older. Design Cross-sectional analysis. Setting, participants Data from the Aging Multidisciplinary Investigation (AMI), a French prospective cohort study with participants randomly selected from the farmer Health Insurance rolls. Measurements Usual GS was measured over a 4 meters-track. BMI was categorized using clinical cutpoints for European populations: (e.g, <20.0 kg/m(2); 20.0-24.9 kg/m(2); 25.0-29.9 kg/m(2); 30.0-34.9 kg/m(2);.35.0 kg/m(2)). Results The current analyses were performed in 449 participants. Mean age was 81 years. Being malnourished/obese was significantly associated with slow GS. Unadjusted and age-adjusted models showed that underweight, overweight and obesity statuses were significantly associated with slow GS for both women (0.83m/s [0.61; 1.04], 0.87m/s [0.72; 1.02], 0.70 m/s [0.41; 0.98], respectively) and men (0.83m/s [0.61; 1.04], 1.11m/s [1.03; 1.20], 0.97m/s [0.75; 1.19], respectively).

Although the bovine adaptor protein 3 complex subunit delta-1 (boAP3D1) has been proposed as the potential receptor, the specific ligand-receptor interaction has not yet been completely defined and boAP3D1 receptor and gp51 3D structures have not been determined. This study was thus aimed at a functional annotation of boAP3D1 cellular adaptor protein and BLV gp51 and, proposing a reliable model for gp51-AP3D1 interaction using bioinformatics tools. The boAP3D1 receptor interaction patterns were calculated based on models of boAP3D1 receptor and gp51 complexes' 3D structures, which were constructed using homology techniques and data-driven docking strategy. The results showed that the participation of 6 key amino acids (aa) on gp51 (Asn170, Trp127, His115, Ala97, Ser98 and Glu128) and 4 aa on AP3D1 (Lys925, Asp807, Asp695 and Arg800) was highly probable in the interaction between gp51 and BLVR domains. Three gp51 recombinant peptides were expressed and purified to validate these results: the complete domain (rgp51), the N-terminal portion (rNgp51) and the C-terminal fragment (rCgp51); and binding assays to Madin-Darby bovine kidney (MDBK) cells were then carried out with each recombinant. It was found that rNgp51 preferentially bound to MDBK cells, suggesting this domain's functional role during invasion. The rNgp51-MDBK cell interaction was sensitive to trypsin (98% reduction) and chymotrypsin treatment (80% reduction). These results highlighted that the N terminal portion of gp51 interacted in vitro with the AP3D1 receptor and provides a plausible in silico interaction model.",Article,"Corredor, A.P.; Gonzalez, J.; Baquero, L.A.; Curtidor, H.; Olaya-Galan, N.N.; Patarroyo, M.A.; Gutierrez, M.F.",,RECEPTOR-BINDING DOMAIN;CELL-RECEPTOR;COG DATABASE;DNA;CLASSIFICATION;LYMPHOCYTES;INFECTION;MODEL;SHEEP;SU,Colombia,2-s2.0-85048854512

Compared to switched memory B cells, IgM memory B cells had higher iMFI of BAFF-R, PD-1, IL-21R, TLR9, and CD122, but lower iMFI of CD38, CD95, and CD73. Four days after receiving the CpG/cytokine cocktail, higher frequencies of IgM than switched memory B cells-and these in turn greater than naive cells-proliferated and differentiated to antibody secreting cells. At this time point, a small percentage (median of 7.6%) of stimulated IgM memory B cells changed isotype to IgG.

This product was used as raw matter (RM) to produce biochar enriched with phosphate solubilizing bacteria (PSB). Biochar potential as biofertilizer was evaluated in Allium cepa culture at greenhouse scale. Experiments including lignocellulosic mix and LDPEoxo were performed for 75 days in microcosm. Biotransformation progress was performed by monitoring total organic carbon (TOC), CO2 production, laccase (Lac), manganese peroxidase (MnP), and lignin peroxidase (LiP) enzymatic activities. Physical LDPEoxo changes were assessed by atomic force microscopy (AFM), scanning electron microscopy (SEM) and static contact angle (SCA) and chemical changes by Fourier transform infrared spectroscopy (FTIR). Results revealed P. ostreatus was capable of LCB and LDPEoxo biotransformation, obtaining 41% total organic carbon (TOC) removal with CO2 production of 2,323 mg Kg(-1) and enzyme activities of 169,438 UKg(-1), 5,535 UKg(-1) and 5,267 UKg(-1) for LiP, MnP and Lac, respectively. Regarding LDPEoxo, SCA was decreased by 84%, with an increase in signals at 1,076 cm(-1) and 3,271 cm(-1), corresponding to C-O and CO-H bonds.

Epidemic typhus, the infection caused by these obligately intracellular bacteria, continues to be a threat because it is difficult to diagnose due to initial non-specific symptoms and the lack of commercial diagnostic tests that are sensitive and specific during the initial clinical presentation. A vaccine to prevent epidemic typhus would constitute an effective deterrent to the weaponization of R. prowazekii; however, an effective and safe vaccine is not currently available. Due to the cytoplasmic niche of Rickettsia, CD8+ T-cells are critical effectors of immunity; however, the identification of antigens recognized by these cells has not been systematically addressed. To help close this gap, we designed an antigen discovery strategy that uses cell-based vaccination with antigen presenting cells expressing microbe's proteins targeted to the MHC class I presentation pathway.

We studied the factors that influence the perception of the Black-and-chestnut Eagle (Spizaetus isidori) in four rural Andean communities in Colombia and compiled historical and recent evidence on the persecution and other causes of mortality of this species in the country. We applied 267 questionnaires and conducted 16 interviews with local inhabitants, via visits to homes and schools in the surroundings of S. isidori nests. The perception of S. isidori by the inhabitants was largely negative and influenced by different socio-demographic factors such as gender, chicken (Gallus gallus) ownership, and chicken management. The records we obtained indicate that 47 eagles were shot, 16 were captured (three for illegal trafficking) and two were electrocuted on high-tension wires. The persecution of S. isidori occurs as retaliation or as a preventative measure against chicken predation, and is a significant cause of mortality of this species in Colombia. Effective conservation planning for S. isidori in Colombia needs to go further than the protected areas system, and include a socioecological perspective in conservation practices applied at landscapes scales that are dominated by people. Education programs and socioecological research, along with participatory work in local communities are key to the conservation of S. isidori in breeding territories.

Different variables were analyzed, such as the injured person's sex, age, education level, and type of road user; the timeframe, place and circumstances of crashes and the vehicles associated with the occurrence. Furthermore, a time series analysis was conducted using an auto-regressive integrated moving average. Results There were 105 events per month on an average, 64.9% of RTI involved men; 82.3% of the persons injured were from 18 to 59 years of age; the average age was 35.4 years of age; the road users most involved in RTI were motorcyclists (69%), followed by pedestrians (12%). 70% had up to upper-secondary education. Sunday was the day with the most RTI occurrences; 93% of the RTI occurred in the urban area. The time series showed a seasonal pattern and a significant trend effect. The modeling process verified the existence of both memory and extrinsic variables related. Conclusions An RTI occurrence pattern was identified, which showed an upward trend during the period analyzed.

A baseline questionnaire, which included questions from the Brief Symptom Inventory about seven common symptoms, was completed by 12,072 participants aged 20-59 from 46 occupational groups in 18 countries (response rate 70%). The seven symptoms were all mutually associated (odds ratios for pairwise associations 3.4 to 9.3), and each contributed to a measure of somatising tendency that exhibited an exposureresponse relationship both with multi-site pain (prevalence rate ratios up to six), and also with sickness absence for non-musculoskeletal reasons. In most participants, the level of somatising tendency was little changed when reassessed after a mean interval of 14 months (75% having a change of 0 or 1 in their symptom count), although the specific symptoms reported at follow-up often differed from those at baseline. Somatising tendency was more common in women than men, especially at older ages, and varied markedly across the 46 occupational groups studied, with higher rates in South and Central America.

However, it is labor-intensive and costly to carry it out. Some countries have faced challenges implementing contact tracing, and no impact evaluations using empirical data have assessed its impact on COVID-19 mortality. This study assesses the impact of contact tracing in a middle-income country, providing data to support the expansion and optimization of contact tracing strategies to improve infection control. Methods We obtained publicly available data on all confirmed COVID-19 cases in Colombia between March 2 and June 16, 2020. (N = 54,931 cases over 135 days of observation). As suggested by WHO guidelines, we proxied contact tracing performance as the proportion of cases identified through contact tracing out of all cases identified. We calculated the daily proportion of cases identified through contact tracing across 37 geographical units (32 departments and five districts). Further, we used a sequential log-log fixed-effects model to estimate the 21-days, 28-days, 42-days, and 56-days lagged impact of the proportion of cases identified through contact tracing on daily COVID-19 mortality. Both the proportion of cases identified through contact tracing and the daily number of COVID-19 deaths are smoothed using 7-day moving averages. Models control for the prevalence of active cases, second-degree polynomials, and mobility indices. Robustness checks to include supply-side variables were performed. Results We found that a 10 percent increase in the proportion of cases identified through contact tracing is related to COVID-19 mortality reductions between 0.8% and 3.4%. Our models explain between 47%-70% of the variance in mortality. Results are robust to changes of specification and inclusion of supply-side variables. Conclusion Contact tracing is instrumental in containing infectious diseases. Its prioritization as a surveillance strategy will substantially impact reducing deaths while minimizing the impact on the fragile economic systems of lower and middle-income countries.

Because peptides presented by several major histocompatibility complex (MHC) supertypes are potential targets for immunotherapy, the aim of this study was to determine whether MHC molecules other than the A2 supertype present the TcTLE peptide. Methodology/Principal Findings: From 36 HLA-A2-negative chagasic patients, the HLA-A genotypes of twenty-eight patients with CD8+ T cells that recognized the TcTLE peptide using tetramer (twenty) or functional (eight) assays, were determined. SSP-PCR was used to identify the A locus and the allelic variants. Flow cytometry was used to analyze the frequency of TcTLE-specific CD8+ T cells, and their functional activity (IFN-γ, TNFα, IL-2, perforin, granzyme and CD107a/b production) was induced by exposure to the TcTLE peptide. All patients tested had TcTLE-specific CD8+ T cells with frequencies ranging from 0.07-0.37%. Interestingly, seven of the twenty-eight patients had HLA-A homozygous alleles: A∗24 (5 patients), A∗23 (1 patient) and A∗01 (1 patient), which belong to the A24 and A1 supertypes. In the remaining 21 patients with HLA-A heterozygous alleles, the most prominent alleles were A24 and A68. The most common allele sub-type was A∗2402 (sixteen patients), which belongs to the A24 supertype, followed by A∗6802 (six patients) from the A2 supertype. Additionally, the A∗3002/A∗3201 alleles from the A1 supertype were detected in one patient. All patients presented CD8+ T cells producing at least one cytokine after TcTLE peptide stimulation. Conclusion/Significance: These results show that TcTLE is a promiscuous peptide that is presented by the A24 and A1 supertypes, in addition to the A2 supertype, suggesting its potential as a target for immunotherapy.",Article,"Lasso, Paola.; Beltran, Lina.; Guzman, Fanny.; Rosas, Fernando.; Thomas, M.

This strategy is often difficult to study because the exact boundaries of a group can be unclear. Weaverbirds present an ideal model for the study of group living, because their colonies occupy a space with discrete boundaries: a single tree. We examined one aspect of group living. nest placement, in three Kenyan weaverbird species: the Black-capped Weaver (Pseudonigrita cabanisi), Grey-capped Weaver (P. arnaudi) and White-browed Sparrow Weaver (Ploceropasser mahali). We asked which environmental, biological, and/or abiotic factors influenced their nest arrangement and location in a given tree. We used machine learning to analyze measurements taken from 16 trees and 516 nests outside the breeding season at the Mpala Research Station in Laikipia Kenya, along with climate data for the area. We found that tree architecture, number of nests per tree, and nest-specific characteristics were the main variables driving nest placement. Our results suggest that different Kenyan weaverbird species have similar priorities driving the selection of where a nest is placed within a given tree.

Proteases are appealing drug targets because they play pivotal roles in facilitating parasite survival and promoting pathogenesis. Enzymes belonging to the dipeptidyl peptidase 3 (DPP3) group have been described in different organisms such as mammals, insects and yeast, in which these enzymes have been involved in both protein turnover and protection against oxidative damage. The aim of this work was to characterize the structure and function of the Leishmania braziliensis DPP3 (LbDPP3) protein as the first step to elucidate its suitability as a potential drug target. Sequence alignment showed 43% of identity between LbDPP3 and its human orthologous (hDPP3) enzyme. Although the modeled protein adopted a globally conserved three-dimensional (3D) structure, structural differences were found in the vicinity of the active site and the substrate binding-cleft. In addition, the Leishmania protein was expressed as a soluble recombinant protein and its kinetics parameters were determined using the z-Arginine-Arginine-AMC substrate. The LbDPP3 activity was maximal at pH values between 8.0 +/- 8.5. Interestingly, classical enzyme inhibitors such as the tynorphin and its derivative peptide IVYPW were found to actively inhibit the LbDPP3 activity. Moreover, these DPP3 inhibitors showed a detrimental effect upon parasite survival, decreasing the viability of promastigotes by up to 29%. Finally, it was observed that LbDPP3 was equally expressed along the in vitro differentiation from promastigotes to axenic amastigotes. In conclusion, these findings suggest that the L. brazileinsis DPP3 could be a promising drug target.",Article,"Diaz, J.R.; Ramirez, C.A.; Nocua, P.A.; Guzman, F.; Requena, J.M.; Puerta, C.J.",,MUCOCUTANEOUS LEISHMANIASIS;COMPUTATIONAL APPROACH;DRUG-RESISTANCE;BINDING;INHIBITION;MECHANISM;DONOVANI,Colombia;Chile;Spain,2-s2.0-85040090171

The Red List index (RLI) reflects changes in aggregate extinction risk for sets of species over time (a value of zero means that all species are extinct, a value of one means that all species are categorized as Least Concern). We calculated the first national RLI for birds in Colombia for the period 2002-2016, and disaggregated indices by ecosystems, regions, and species groups. Overall, the status of birds in Colombia has moderately deteriorated during 2002-2016, declining by 0.0000714% per year (the global RLI for birds declined by 0.0297% per year). High Andean forest, paramo, and freshwater are the ecosystems in worst condition. The two regions with the greatest avian diversity contrasted: the Andes has the lowest RLI, and the Amazon the highest. Among species groups, gamebirds, parrots, large frugivores, and forest raptors are the most threatened. Habitat loss from expansion of illicit crops and population declines from hunting were the most important threats. Agricultural expansion, invasive alien animal species, illegal logging and illegal mining are significant threats for some species. Tracking species' extinction risk is important in a country with the highest bird species richness in the world, dynamic spatial patterns of habitat loss, and high levels of endemism. Recent developments provide reasons for both hope and despair. In 2016, a peace agreement ended 50 years of armed conflict. New opportunities for biodiversity conservation, local development based on bird-watching tourism, and advancement in scientific knowledge of birds now occur alongside dramatic increases in deforestation. These new conservation opportunities and challenges provide strong motivation to take advantage of the fact that the overall risk of extinction of birds in Colombia is still relatively low and stable.

DNA from eightyfive Helicobacter pylori-cagA positive strains were analyzed. Strains were obtained from patients diagnosed with functional dyspepsia at Clinica Fundadores in Bogota. The 3' region of the cagA gene was amplified through conventional Polymerase Chain Reaction (PCR). Obtained amplicons were sequenced using the Sanger method and analyzed with bioinformatics tools. Additionally, a significant Spearman correlation coefficient was determined between the patients' age and the number of EPIYA-C repeats; with p values < 0.05 considered significant. Estimates were obtained using a 95% CI. The 3 ' variable region of the cagA gene was amplified and PCR products of the following sizes corresponded to the following EPIYA motifs: 400 bp: EPIYA AB, 500 bp: EPIYA ABC, 600 bp: EPIYA ABCC and 700 bp: ABCCC. A single PCR band was observed for 58 out of 85 Helicobacter pylori isolates, with an EPIYA distribution motif as follows: 7/85 AB (8.2%), 34/85 ABC (40%), 26/85 ABCC (30.6%) and 18/85 ABCCC (21.2%). However, in 27 out of 85 Helicobacter pylori isolates, two or more bands were observed, where the most predominant cagA genotype were ABC-ABCC (26%, 7/27) and ABCC-ABCCC (22.2%, 6/27). A direct proportionality between the number of EPIYA-C repeats and an increase in the patients' age was observed, finding a greater number of EPIYA ABCC and ABCCC repeats in the population over 50 years old. All isolates were of the Western cagA type and 51.8% of them were found to have multiple EPIYA-C repeats.

The project was developed in collaboration with a public healthcare network comprised of 38 urban and rural centers with women between the ages of 25 and 65 years, healthcare providers of the cancer program, healthcare administrators and the general manager of said network. Our HCD process involved five stages: research, need synthesis, ideation and co-design process, prototyping and in-context usability testing. In practice, some of the stages are overlapped and iterated throughout the design process. We conducted observations, open-ended interviews and conversations, multi-stakeholder workshops, focus groups, systematic text condensation analyses and tests in real contexts. As a result, we designed four prototypes: (1) 'Encanto': An educational manicure service, (2) 'No le des la espalda a la citologia': A media-based strategy, (3) An educational wireless queuing device in the waiting room, and (4) Citobot: A cervical cancer early detection device, system, and method. The tests carried out with each prototype showed their value, limitations and possibilities in terms of subsequent development and validation through public health research or clinical research. We recognize that a longer-term evaluation is required in order to determine whether the prototypes will be used regularly, integrated into cervical cancer screening services and effectively improve access to cytology as a screening test. We conclude that HCD is a useful for design-based prevention in the field of cervical cancer.

Methods In an online experiment (October 2020), 8,061 Colombians were randomized to a nutrient warning, guideline daily amounts (GDA), Nutri-Score, or no-label condition. They viewed two fruit drinks labeled according to their condition, one high in sugar and one not, and completed selection tasks. Next, they assessed four products high in sugar, sodium, and/or saturated fat (""high in"" product). Finally, they selected which label would most discourage them from consuming a ""high in"" product. Results The nutrient warning performed better on most outcomes. Twenty percent of participants exposed to the nutrient warning would purchase the high-sugar fruit drink compared to GDA (24%, p<0.01), Nutri-Score (33%, p<0.001), and no label (29%, p<0.001). GDA performed slightly better than the nutrient warning in identifying the high-sugar fruit drink (91% vs 88%, p<0.001). The nutrient warning best helped participants correctly identify other ""high in"" products (75% vs. 23% no-label, 26% Nutri-Score, and 43% GDA, all p<0.001) and had the highest perceived message effectiveness (3.86 on 5-point scale vs. 2.97 GDA and 2.70 Nutri-Score, both p<0.001) and lowest likelihood of purchasing ""high in"" products (2.58 on 5-point scale vs. 3.23 GDA, 3.49 Nutri-Score, and 3.51 no label, all p<0.001).

We propose that young age and previous infections could be simple factors that affect this response. Here, we evaluated the primary and secondary responses of circulating ASC in infants (6-12 months old) and children (1-14 years old) infected with dengue showing different degrees of clinical severity. The ASC response was delayed and of lower magnitude in infants, compared with older children. In primary infection (PI), the total and envelope (E) protein-specific IgM ASC were dominant in infants but not in children, and a negative correlation was found between age and the number of IgM ASC (rho = -0.59, P = 0.03). However, infants with plasma dengue-specific IgG detectable in the acute phase developed an intense ASC response largely dominated by IgG and comparable to that of children with secondary infection (SI). IgM and IgG produced by ASC circulating in PI or SI were highly cross-reactive among the four serotypes. Dengue infection caused the disturbance of B cell subsets, particularly a decrease in the relative frequency of naive B cells. Higher frequencies of total and E protein-specific IgM ASC in the infants and IgG in the children were associated with clinically severe forms of infection. Therefore, the ASC response induced by dengue is highly influenced by the age at which infection occurs and previous immune status, and its magnitude is a relevant element in the clinical outcome.

PPIs such as omeprazole, esomeprazole, pantoprazole and lansoprazole are metabolized by the CYP2C19 enzyme, which is encoded by a polymorphic gene. Four polymorphisms have an impact on the speed of PPI metabolism: CYP2C19*1/*1 (extensive metabolizers), CYP2C19*2/*2 (intermediate metabolizers), CYP2C19*3/*3 (poor metabolizers) and CYP2C19*17/*17 (ultrarapid metabolizers). Extensive and ultrarapid metabolizers inactivate PPIs quickly, which consequently causes low plasma concentrations of PPIs, while intermediate or poor metabolizers have higher plasma concentrations of PPIs and, therefore, PPIs have greater therapeutic efficacy in individuals with these polymorphisms. Objective To determine the frequency of genetic polymorphisms of the CPY2C19 enzyme in Bogota, Colombia. Methods This observational study was conducted in Bogota between 2012 and 2015 and was part of a clinical trial (ID: NCT03650543). It included 239 subjects with dyspepsia, H. pylori infection, or GERD symptoms. CYP2C19 genotyping was performed on gastric biopsy samples. Polymorphisms *1, *2, and *3 were analyzed by real-time PCR (Roche (R)), and PCR-RFLP was used to determine the presence of polymorphism *17. Results The distribution of different types of PPI metabolizers was as follows: extensive (70.7%), ultrarapid (12.9%), intermediate (8.8%) and poor (0.8%). Conclusion The population studied consisted mainly of extensive and ultrarapid PPI metabolizers. These findings show that it is necessary to increase PPI doses in this group of subjects or to use PPIs that are not metabolized by CYP2C19 (rabeprazole).

Approximately 80% of keratinocyte carcinomas consist of basal cell carcinomas (BCC) with 50% of these being considered as low-risk tumors. Nevertheless, 83% of the low-risk BCC patients were found to receive more follow-up care than recommended according to the Dutch BCC guideline, which is one visit post-treatment for this group. More efficient management could reduce unnecessary follow-up care and related costs. Objectives To study the efficacy, cost-utility, and budget impact of a personalized discharge letter for low-risk BCC patients compared with usual care (no personalized letter). Methods In a multi-center intervention study, a personalized discharge letter in addition to usual care was compared to usual care in first-time BCC patients. Model-based cost-utility and budget impact analyses were conducted, using individual patient data gathered via surveys. The outcome measures were number of follow-up visits, costs and quality adjusted life years (QALY) per patient. Results A total of 473 first-time BCC patients were recruited. The personalized discharge letter decreased the number of follow-up visits by 14.8% in the first year. The incremental costs after five years were -Euro24.45 per patient. The QALYs were 4.12 after five years and very similar in both groups. The national budget impact was -Euro2,7 million after five years.

Objective Our aim is to explore the perspectives and opinions of adolescents, parents, educators/ youth workers, and clinicians regarding the appeal and usability of an existing patient-centered digital intervention (DIALOG+), which aims to improve quality of life. Methods As part of a broader study aiming to adapt and test DIALOG+, we conducted Online Focus Groups (OFGs) with adults and adolescents in two cities in Colombia. The existing DIALOG + intervention was introduced to participants, followed by a structured discussion regarding the opinions and views of stakeholders. A framework approach was used to identify the main themes followed by content analysis to aid adaptation. Results We conducted 10 OFGs with a total of 45 participants. A positive feature highlighted by all groups was the innovation of including a digital intervention in a traditional medical visit. Additionally, participants considered that the active role that adolescents have when using the intervention empowers them. Barriers identified included concerns from clinicians related to the time required during consultations and confusion with terminology.

We evaluated whether the use, habitat preference, and niche range of the Amblyomma mixtum tick changed between stages, habitats, and seasonality (dry-wet seasons 2019) on a farm in Yopal (Casanare, Colombia). The presence and relative abundance of free-living larvae, nymphs, and adults was quantified in four different habitats according to the type of vegetation cover (Riparian Forest, Cocoa Crop, King Grass Crop, and Star Grass Paddock). Habitat availability was estimated, environmental variables were analyzed, and various indices of habitat use and preference, and niche width were calculated. A. mixtum's habitat use and preference, and niche width changed between stages, habitat types, and time of the year. The total abundance of A. mixtum was an order of magnitude greater in the dry season than the wet season. In the dry season, all stages used all habitats, while A. mixtum adults used all the habitats in both seasons. In the dry season, nymphs and larvae preferred three out of the four habitats, while adults preferred the King Grass Crop. In the wet season, nymphs and larvae preferred two habitats, whereas the adults preferred the King Grass Crop. The value of the niche width index was high for larvae, nymphs, and adults in the dry season, while it was high only for adults in the wet season. Thus, A. mixtum's vast environmental tolerance and niche breadth allows the species to use and colonize changing habitats (unstable or temporary) with fluctuating environmental conditions (e.g., King Grass Crop), potentially keeping a stable population over time and making it an extremely resistant species. However, the wet flooding season in Yopal may exceed A. mixtum's stages' tolerances.",Article,"Forero-Becerra, E.; Acosta, A.; Benavides, E.; Martinez-Diaz, H.C.; Hidalgo, M.",,TICKS ACARI IXODIDAE;WATER-BALANCE CHARACTERISTICS;POPULATION-DYNAMICS;CAJENNENSE FABRICIUS;SPOTTED-FEVER;HABITAT USE;SAO-PAULO;HOST-SPECIFICITY;NATURAL HOSTS;LIFE-CYCLE,Colombia,2-s2.0-85127683075

In Colombia, new graduates provide care for vulnerable populations. The World Health Organization (WHO) Basic Emergency Care (BEC) course trains frontline providers with limited resources in the management of acute illness and injury. While this course may serve medical students as adjunct to current curriculum, its utility in this learner group has not been investigated. This study performs a baseline assessment of knowledge and confidence in emergency management taught in the BEC amongst medical students in Colombia. Methods A validated, cross-sectional survey assessing knowledge and confidence of emergency care congruent with BEC content was electronically administered to graduating medical students across Colombia. Knowledge was evaluated via 15 multiple choice questions and confidence via 13 questions using 100 mm visual analog scales. Mean knowledge and confidence scores were compared across demographics, geography and prior training using Chi-Squared or one-way ANOVA analyses. Results Data were gathered from 468 graduating medical students at 36 institutions. The mean knowledge score was 59.9% +/- 23% (95% CI 57.8-62.0%); the mean confidence score was 59.6 mm +/- 16.7 mm (95% CI 58.1-61.2). Increasing knowledge and confidence scores were associated with prior completion of emergency management training courses (p<0.0001). Conclusion Knowledge and confidence levels of emergency care management for graduating medical students across Colombia demonstrated room for additional, specialized training. Higher scores were seen in groups that had completed emergency care courses.

An ambispective cohort was established from March 2020 to February 2021. From November 2020 to February 2021, SARS-CoV-2 antibodies were measured on two occasions 14–90 days apart to determine seroprevalence and seroconversion. We used multivariate log-binomial regression to evaluate factors associated with SARS-CoV-2 infection. Among 2,597 HCWs, the cumulative incidence of infection was 35.7%, and seroprevalence was 21.5%. A reduced risk of infection was observed among those aged 35–44 and ≥45 years (adjusted relative risks [aRRs], 0.84 and 0.83, respectively), physicians (aRR, 0.77), those wearing N95 respirators (aRR, 0.82) and working remotely (aRR, 0.74).

In the context of a city, for example, clusters may be characterized by the proximity of events in the metric space. However, events may also occur over urban structures such as public transportation and infrastructure systems, which are naturally represented as networks. Our work provides a theoretical framework to determine whether events distributed over a set of interconnected nodes are concentrated on a particular subset. Our main analysis shows how the proposed or any other measure of event concentration on a network must explicitly take into account its degree distribution. We apply the framework to measure event concentration (i) on a street network (i.e., approximated as a regular network where events represent criminal activities); and (ii) on a social network (i.e., a power law network where events represent users who are dissatisfied after purchasing the same product).",Article,"Campos, J.; Finke, J.",,,Colombia,2-s2.0-85097124998

We asked participants to pick the larger single-digit numeral in a pair and collected their implicit confidence with button pressure (button pressure was validated with three empirical signatures of confidence). We also modeled their choices with a drift-diffusion decision model to compute the post-decision estimate of being correct.

One challenge in administering MPS is identification of an appropriate and effective participant consent process. This study investigated the impact of different survey consent approaches on participant disposition (response characteristics and understanding of the purpose of the survey) within the context of an MPS that measured noncommunicable disease (NCD) risk factors across Colombia and Uganda. Methods Participants were randomized to one of five consent approaches, with consent modules varying by the consent disclosure and mode of authorization. The control arm consisted of a standard consent disclosure and a combined opt-in/opt-out mode of authorization. The other four arms consist of a modified consent disclosure and one of four different forms of authorization (i.e., opt-in, opt-out, combined opt-in/opt-out, or implied). Data related to respondent disposition and respondent understanding of the survey purpose were analyzed. Results Among 1889 completed surveys in Colombia, differences in contact, response, refusal, and cooperation rates by study arms were found. About 68% of respondents correctly identified the survey purpose, with no significant difference by study arm. Participants reporting higher levels of education and urban residency were more likely to identify the purpose correctly. Participants were also more likely to accurately identify the survey purpose after completing several survey modules, compared to immediately following the consent disclosure (78.8% vs 54.2% correct, p<0.001). In Uganda, 1890 completed surveys were collected. Though there were differences in contact, refusal, and cooperation rates by study arm, response rates were similar across arms. About 37% of respondents identified the survey purpose correctly, with no difference by arm. Those with higher levels of education and who completed the survey in English were able to more accurately identify the survey purpose. Again, participants were more likely to accurately identify the purpose of the survey after completing several NCD modules, compared to immediately following the consent module (42.0% vs 32.2% correct, p = 0.013). Conclusion This study contributes to the limited available evidence regarding consent procedures for automated MPS.

However, firms may exert influence on the local structure of the product attribute space by offering product variants with new attributes. As a result, the geometry of the product attribute space would change endogenously through firms' actions, and this emergent new geometry modifies the conditions for subsequent firm behavior. By focusing on this interplay between actors and conditions, we explore the co-evolution of the firm and the product attribute space. Through a multi-variant Cournot competition framework, we develop a computational model in which firms invest to differentiate their products from other variants, but as minimally as possible so that demand from closely similar existing variants can be stolen. We introduce the fraction dimensionality of the attribute space as our critical independent variable, to reflect saturation of the space with product varieties. The simulation reveals that while new product variants are typically introduced by firms with scale economies, their performance gap with firms without scale economies reduces as fraction dimensionality increases. This indicates that space geometry evolution may favor small-scale players, even when their large-scale competitors are the driving force behind attribute space changes.",Article,"Garcia-Diaz, C.; Peli, G.; van Witteloostuijn, A.",,DEVELOPMENT EXTERNALITIES;COMPLEX DYNAMICS;LINE LENGTH;MODEL;COMPETITION;OLIGOPOLY;INDUSTRY;DUOPOLY;INTERDEPENDENCY;DIMENSIONALITY,Colombia;Hungary;Netherlands;Belgium,2-s2.0-85086525041

By reducing biomass fluctuation, biodiversity could mitigate the impact of changing environmental conditions on rural incomes as long as people exploits a diverse set of natural assets. This effect is analogous to the risk-spreading function of financial portfolios. This paper presents evidence of the portfolio effect for an open-access artisanal fishery in an estuarine ecosystem, located in a Colombian Biosphere Reserve. Using catch statistics from 2002 to 2018, we evaluate the contribution of catch diversity to the stabilization of fishing income. We find that changes in catch composition are related to seasonal and interannual variations in salinity conditions. The portfolio effect arises from asynchronous fluctuations of fish species due to fluctuating environmental conditions.

We used data from the 2015-2016 Malawi Population-based HIV Impact Assessment (MPHIA) to estimate progress toward 90-90-90 targets (90% of those with HIV know their HIV-positive status; of these, 90% are receiving ART; and of these, 90% have viral load suppression [VLS]) for HIV-positive women reporting a live birth in the previous 3 years. Methods MPHIA was a nationally representative household survey; consenting eligible women aged 15-64 years were interviewed on pregnancies and outcomes, including HIV status during their most recent pregnancy, PMTCT uptake, and early infant diagnosis (EID) testing. Descriptive analyses were weighted to account for the complex survey design. Viral load (VL) results were categorized by VLS (<1, 000 copies/mL) and undetectable VL (target not detected/below the limit of detection). Results Of the 3, 153 women included in our analysis, 371 (10.1%, 95% confidence interval [CI]: 8.8%-11.3%) tested HIV positive in the survey.

However, screening programs continue to face implementation challenges, especially in developing country contexts. In this study, we use a mixed-methods approach to understand the reasons for no-show behaviour for cervical cancer screening appointments among hard-to-reach low-income women in Bogotá, Colombia. In the quantitative phase, individual attendance probabilities are predicted using administrative records from an outreach program (N = 23384) using both LASSO regression and Random Forest methods. In the qualitative phase, semi-structured interviews are analysed to understand patient perspectives (N = 60). Both inductive and deductive coding are used to identify first-order categories and content analysis is facilitated using the Framework method. Quantitative analysis shows that younger patients and those living in zones of poverty are more likely to miss their appointments. Likewise, appointments scheduled on Saturdays, during the school vacation periods or with lead times longer than 10 days have higher no-show risk.

In the last two decades, the recommended treatment for its eradication, as first-line scheme is the standard triple therapy, consisting of an inhibitor of the proton pump, clarithromycin and amoxicillin or metronidazole.In recent years the effectiveness of this therapy has declined, especially due to the resistance of bacteria tometronidazole and clarithromycin. Objectives: In this study, we evaluated the prevalence of primary resistance of Colombian H. pylori isolatesto metronidazole, clarithromycin, amoxicillin. In addition, the vacA and cagA genotypes of strains isolated were determined and associated to correlate the virulence markers and antibiotic resistance. Methods: Minimum inhibitory concentration (MIC) for metronidazole, clarithromycin and amoxicillin were determined by E-test method. Genomic DNA was extracted, and allelic variants of vacA and cagA were identified by the polymerasechain reaction (PCR). Results: Resistance to metronidazole was 81.01 % (IC95% 70.3%-88.6%), to amoxicillin3,8% (IC 95% 0-8,6%), and to clarithromycin 17.72% (IC95% 10.37-28. 29). No significant correlation between pathogenicity and resistance or susceptibility was detected when MIC values for each antibiotic were compared with different vacA and cagA genotypes. Conclusion: We find a high rate of resistance to three principal antibiotics used in the majority of the successful schemes of eradication of the infection, which implies the need to investigate with priority new schemes of treatment for the eradication of the infection in Colombia. © 2010 Asociaciones Colombianas de Gastroenterología, Endoscopia digestiva, Coloproctología y Hepatología.",Article,"Trespalacios-Rangel, Alba A.; Regino, William Otero.; Reyes, Marcela Mercado",Amoxicillin;Clarithromycin;Genotypes;Helicobacter pylori;Metronidazole,Amoxicillin;Clarithromycin;Genotypes;Helicobacter pylori;Metronidazole,Colombia;Colombia;Colombia,

Many treatments have been investigated, some of which require changes in lifestyle related to associated risk factors. Although changes in lifestyle are recommended, the evidence that supports these recommendations is controversial and scarce. Objective: The objective of this study is to estimate the impact of lifestyle changes on patients with GERD. Methodology: A systematic search of the literature in PubMed, Science Direct and Embase was conducted using the following keywords: gastroesophagueal (sic) reflux, heartburn, bed head elevation, Carbonated Beverages, mint, cocoa, citrus, Drinking Alcohol, caffeine, coffee, late-evening meal, spicy food, fatty foods, obesity, weight loss, exercise and Smoking Cessation. Controlled clinical trials and prospective cohort studies that studied lifestyle changes and their effects on GERD were included in the study. Results: Of the 2,731 articles found, fifteen were included in our analysis. There is little evidence that suspending consumption of food or drink items such as peppermint, chocolate, citrus, carbonated beverages, fatty foods and spicy foods clinically improves GERD. Decaffeinated coffee may decrease the amount of reflux, and quitting smoking is associated with improvement in symptoms. Meal times at night can change some parameters of pH monitoring but did not alter symptoms. Some exercises, mainly respiratory, may improve symptoms. There is evidence that elevating the head while in the bed and weight loss (in cases of overweight or obese patients) improve symptoms, but there is also evidence against these methods and studies of them have methodological limitations.

In Colombia, it is the leading cause of cancer mortality. The annual incidence and mortality are 16.3/100,000 and 14.2/100,000 inhabitants respectively. The aim of this study was to estimate the disease burden in Colombia as measured in disability-adjusted life years (DALYs). Methods: This study focuses on prevalence in 2014. To estimate prevalence, a search was made in the registries of the Social Protection Information System (SISPRO) and the National Administrative Department of Statistics (DANE). The average duration of cases and estimated survival were obtained from the local literature. DALYs were calculated by adding the years of life lost due to premature death (YLLs) and years of life lived with disability (YLD) according to the methodology of the World Health Organization (WHO). Results: Prevalences estimated for five years in the population older than 15 years were 40.9/100,000 for women and 62.5/100,000 for men. The total DALY was 293,418, with a rate of 623/100,000 inhabitants; 97.4% correspond to YLL. The YLD and YLL for Colombia were 16/100,000 and 607/100,000, respectively. Conclusions: Data obtained from SISPRO and DANE estimate a high disease burden in Colombia.

Multiple techniques for measuring reflux have been used, and many authors (1-3) have asked why this situation, possibly because the techniques measure and quantify the basic pathophysiologic problem disease, ie the time of exposure of the esophagus distal to the gastric juice, because the measures are quantitatively related to the degree of esophageal mucosal injury, or because the episodes of expo-sure to gastric juice correlated with the patient's symptoms. As said Richter (4) ""many times these studies are unnecessary because the history is sufficiently revealing to identify the presence of GERD. But the clinician must decide which test you choose to carry a diagnosis of a reliable, timely and cost-effective"". But we cannot rely on the presence of symptoms to diagnosis, because we incur the overdiagnosis in a considerable number of individuals, the sensitivity set for the typical symptoms as heartburn is 68% and specificity was 63% (2), which leads us to conclude that atypical symptoms should be investigated as they may relate to functional dyspepsia rather than GERD. It is also clear that the severity and frequency of symptoms in any way correlates with the presence or absence of esophagitis, patients with erosive esophagitis are more severe disease and increased risk of developing complications. The persistent exposure of the esophagus to gastric juice does not cause mucosal injury in all individuals, therefore, it is possible to define the disease by the presence of mucosal injury, while endoscopy is able to define the mucosal injury caused by the reflux can also lead to false conclusions, such as those patients with symptoms of GERD who have no mucosal injury, do not have GERD (4-6). © 2009 Asociaciones Colombianas de Gastroenterología, Endoscopia digestiva, Coloproctología y Hepatología.",Article,"Hani, Albis",Barrett;Heartburn;Monitoring;Reflux;Regurgitation,Barrett;Heartburn;Monitoring;Reflux;Regurgitation,Colombia,

Objective: This study seeks to analyze agreement between the most used scales to estimate the risk of patient morbidity and mortality in a population treated at 2,670 meters above sea level (m.a.s.l.). Materials and methods: Two hundred patients between 18 and 65 years old, diagnosed with acute pancreatitis, were evaluated and treated at the Hospital Universitario San Ignacio, Bogotá (Colombia). Three risk scales were used for the estimations. Scores ≥ 8 in the APACHE II system, ≥ 2 in the Modified Marshall Score, or 3 or more positive Ranson criteria were classified as pancreatitis with severity prognostic marker. Agreement between the results was determined using the Kappa coefficient. Results: According to the Marshall score, 45.5% of the cases were pancreatitis with predicted severity, while APACHE II and Ranson yielded scores of 39.5% and 38.5%, respectively. The Kappa coefficient showed weak agreement between APACHE II and Ranson (Kappa=0.201; 95%CI 0.05-0.34), poor agreement between Ranson and Marshall (Kappa=0.18; 95%CI 0.04-0.32), and moderate agreement between APACHE II and Marshall (Kappa=0.42; 95%CI 0.28-0.56). Conclusions: There is poor agreement between the pancreatitis severity scoring systems used in Colombia, so they cannot be interpreted as clinically equivalent. The data from this study demonstrate the need to validate the scales in Colombia and Latin America. They also suggest that the Marshall scale overestimates the risk in cities above 2,000 m.a.s.l.",Article,"Rodriguez-Varon, Alberto.; Munoz, Oscar Mauricio.; Unknown.; Unknown",Acute pancreatitis;Agreement;Mortality;Multivariate prediction models,Acute pancreatitis;Agreement;Mortality;Multivariate prediction models,Colombia,

Objective: To evaluate the association between body mass index and the degree of liver fibrosis in patients diagnosed with fatty liver in a hepatology center in the city of Bogotá, Colombia. Patients and methods: A case-control study is carried out with patients diagnosed with fatty liver, who have undergone real-time elastography (Supersonic). Information was taken from patients diagnosed with fatty liver who met the inclusion criteria. Continuous variables were described using measures of central tendency and standard deviation. Categorical variables were described with numbers and percentages. A 95% confidence interval was considered statistically significant. Results: 361 patients were included, of which 95.2% (n=344) presented some degree of alteration (12% minimal fibrosis, 33% moderate fibrosis, 34% severe fibrosis and 16% cirrhosis) and only 5% showed a liver normal. Not having an adequate weight is related to severe fibrosis F3 OR 3.24 (1.03-10) and cirrhosis F4 OR 2.33 (2.33-42.99). No statistically significant differences were found between altered body mass index and any degree of fibrosis OR 2.74 (0.90-8.40). The presence of DM presents a 10-fold risk proba-bility of ending in F4 cirrhosis, especially with poor disease control OR 5.16 (1.23-30.33).

,,,0,2-s2.0-85136255966,2022,Barogenic perforation of the esophagus: An unusual manifestation,"Introduction: Typically, when esophageal perforation secondary to barotrauma is mentioned as the causal pathophysiological mechanism of perforation, the literature refers to spontaneous esophageal perforation or Boerhaave syndrome as an entity. It involves the longitudinal and transmural rupture of the esophagus (previously healthy) secondary to an abrupt increase in intraluminal esophageal pressure, frequently triggered during vomiting. However, in the medical literature, some reports list mechanisms of barotrauma other than this entity. Case report: A 64-year-old female patient with a history of surgically managed gastric adenocarcinoma (total gastrectomy and esophagoenteral anastomosis) presented with stenosis of the esophagojejunal anastomosis, which required an endoscopic dilatation protocol with a CRETM balloon. The third session of endoscopic dilation was held; in removing the endoscope, we identified a deep esophageal laceration with a 4 cm long perforation at the level of the middle esophagus (8 cm proximal to the dilated anastomosis), suspecting the mechanism of barotrauma as the causal agent. She required urgent transfer to the operating room, where we performed thoracoscopic esophagectomy, broad-spectrum empiric antimicrobial coverage, and enteral nutrition by advanced tube during in-hospital surveillance. The control esophagram at seven days showed a small leak over the anastomotic area, which was managed conservatively. Imaging control at 14 days showed a decrease in the size of the leak, with good evolution and tolerance to the oral route.

This study descri-bes motility in patients with refractory GERD, and its association with esophageal symptoms. Materials and methods: An analytical observational study was carried out in a retrospective cohort of patients diagnosed with refractory GERD and esophageal symptoms who underwent high-resolution esophageal manometry and impedance testing. Clinical characteristics, demographics, and the association between motility disorders and esophageal symptoms are described. Results: 133 patients were included (mean age 54.1 ± 12.5 years). Heartburn and regurgitation (69.2%), and esophageal dysphagia (13.5%) were the most common symptoms. Normal motility (75.2%), complete bolus clearance (75.2%), and ineffective esophageal motility (IEM) (18%) were the most frequent manometric findings. Type II and IIIb gastroesophageal junction were observed in 35.3% and 33.8% of the cases, respectively. Esophageal aperistalsis (3.8%) and Jackhammer esophagus (0.8%) were rare findings. Incomplete bolus clearance was associated with esophageal dysphagia (p=0.038) and IEM (p=0.008). No esophageal symptoms were significantly related to motility disorders. Conclusions: The results of the present study suggest that motility disorders are rare in patients with refractory GERD.

Objective: The objective of this study is to evaluate short and long term clinical responses to AZA by ulcerative colitis patients in our population who have had inadequate responses to treatment with steroids. Materials and Methods: This is a retrospective study based on a database review of the medical records of 215 ulcerative colitis patients treated at the Hospital Pablo Tobon Uribe between August 2001 and May 2014. Sixty-nine patients (32%) had received AZA, and 30 patients had received at least 3 months of treatment with AZA at the optimal dose of at least 2.0 mg/kg after having responded inadequately to treatment with steroids. This group was included in the study. Results: The median follow-up time was 20 months with a range from three months to 72 months. After three months of treatment, clinical remission was found in 17 patients (57%) out of 30 patients, and partial responses were found in 12 out of 30 subjects (40%). A year after the initial follow-up, 16 patients (53%) maintained clinical remission, three (10%) continued to have partial responses, and five (17%) had relapsed and had received biological therapy. Sixteen patients (53%) achieved one year with steroid treatment suspended and no patients required colectomies. Conclusions: This study demonstrates a clinical remission rate of 53% for patients with mild to moderate ulcerative colitis who were treated with AZA.

Results were defined as compatible with neoplasia, not compatible with neoplasia or inconclusive. Concordance of results was then evaluated. Results: Fifty-seven patients were included. A high percentage EUS results compatible with neoplasia were discordant with CT scan results and with EUS guided fine needle aspiration results (33.3% and 52.5%, respectively). Agreement between imaging and EUS guided fine needle aspiration results was minimal (Kappa 0.02; 95% CI:-0.04 to 0.08).

Management is mainly endoscopic, but in the litera-ture, there is no consensus on the first-line technique between sphincterotomy, biliary stent, or combination. Materials and methods: A case series study was conducted that included all ERCP performed at the San Ignacio University Hospital in Bogotá, Colombia, between January 2010 and March 2021 due to biliary leak after cholecystectomy. Demographic characteristics, clinical manifestations, resolution, adverse events, and hospital length stay were recorded according to the endoscopic technique. Results: 24 patients with postcholecystec-tomy biliary leak managed with ERCP were included. The median age was 59 years (interquartile range [IQR]: 53.5-67). In 75% the surgery was laparoscopic. The most frequent clinical manifestation was increased biliary drainage > 150 mL/24 hours (50%), followed by abdominal pain (39%). The main fistula’s location was the cystic duct in 40%. Management with sphincterotomy was 25%, with a biliary stent, 8.4%, and combined, 66%; leak resolution occurred in 100%, 50%, and 87%, respectively, with a shorter hospital length stay in the combined management of 3.5 days compared to four days in sphincterotomy.

Results: Of the 490 VCEs performed during the study period, 155 indicated iron deficiency anemia; 106 were women (68.4 %), and the mean age was 57.1 ± 16.6 years. The main comorbidities were cardiovascular in 23 (18.3 %) and arterial hypertension in 16 (12.6 %). Antiplatelets were present in 18 (15.4 %) and anticoagulants in six (5.1 %). Small bowel lesions were vascular in 44 studies (28.4 %), inflammatory in 33 (21.2 %), and neoplastic in seven (4.5 %). Angiectasias were the most frequent lesions in 33 cases (21.3 %). P2 lesions were present in 53 VCEs (34.2 %). Conclusions: VCE is helpful in the study of iron deficiency anemia and helps detect positive findings in the midgut in three out of four patients for which it is indicated. The most frequent significant P2 lesions were vascular.

However, endoscopy of the digestive tract may be a useful tool for this purpose. Objective: To report a series of cases of children with a diagnosis of short stature who underwent upper digestive tract endoscopy as part of their study. Case report: 15 children between the ages of 2 and 16 years were included; 53.3 % were girls. 26.7 % presented with malnutrition according to their body mass index and height-for-age, 66.7 % had short stature, and 33.3 % moderate short stature. Abdominal pain was reported in 53.3 % of the cases, and no weight gain in 46.7 %. Other symptoms were lack of appetite in 26.7 %, vomiting in 13.3 %, among others. Between 40 % and 93.4 % of the children presented macro and/or microscopic esophagitis, gastritis, and duodenitis. The most important microscopic findings were chronic duodenitis with giardiasis, duodenal ulcers, duodenal nodular lymphoid hyperplasia, Helicobacter pylori, and chronic eosinophilic duodenitis. Conclusions: Although endoscopy of the digestive tract is a method barely used and not well described in the study of children with short stature, this case report describes organicity in 80 % of the children analyzed.",Article,"Castro-Murillo, Julio Cesar.; Velasco-Benitez, Carlos Alberto.; Unknown",Children;Endoscopy;Growth failure,Children;Endoscopy;Growth failure,Colombia;Colombia,
,,,0,2-s2.0-84875539796,2012,"First Colombian consensus on digestive endoscopy ""agreement on fundamentals"" (First part: Formative aspects)","Purpose of the work. The practice of endoscopy in Colombia was modified when Resolution 1043 of 2006 authorized specialists in general surgery, internal medicine and pediatrics to perform endoscopy after completing one year of training in endoscopy at an institution of higher education. This, together with the development of relationships with different specialties within endoscopy, generated a disordered scenario which many considered to be unjust and unequal. Training requirements became differentiated. A world of tensions and interests among specialists, scientists, health care providers and service providers led to this consensus. Starting with fundamental agreements, it makes recommendations for unification of educational features that will allow endoscopic practices which aim for quality and whose central axis is the best interest of our patients. Materials and Methods. This consensus is a descriptive, cross-sectional social research study with a mixed approach (qualitative and quantitative) based on the Delphy method. The information in this study was obtained from the event titled ""Acuerdo en lo fundamental"" (agreement on fundamental issues) organized on June 23, 2012 by the president of the Colombian Association of Digestive Endoscopy (ACED). Qualitative data were taken from four roundtables discussions in which 34 participants discussed 25 survey questions. The quantitative data were taken from final voting and from an individual, private electronic survey. 75% or greater agreement was defined as consensus. Qualitative analysis employed discourse analysis oriented around five variables related to formative aspects. Basic descriptive statistics centered around percentages were used for quantitative analysis. Results. Participants in the consensus included 34 directors or representatives of 8 of the 9 graduate university programs with specialties in the digestive tract, former presidents of 11 scientific associations, professors of gastrointestinal endoscopy, the vice president of the Ibero-American Nurses Association, directors of institutes of endoscopy, teachers at institutes of endoscopy and four chiefs of graduate resident programs. Some issues upon which consensus was reached include: 81.9% agreed that endoscopy is not simply a diagnostic technique; 88.2% disagreed with one year training as recommended for gastrointestinal endoscopy with quality parameters; 100% underlined that training in endoscopy should take place within qualified and accredited university teaching; More than 84.9% did not recommend training general practitioners, nurses or medical technicians in endoscopy; 85.3% recommended 2-year programs for basic training in endoscopy with 1 to 2 years for advanced endoscopy. Conclusions. The Colombian consensus agrees that endoscopy is an element of support for both diagnostic and therapeutic practice. Training for quality endoscopy requires solid theoretical knowledge and skills, solid technical skills and knowledge and training in how to make ethical judgments. The basic requirement for training in gastrointestinal endoscopy should be that the student is enrolled in a clinical, surgical or pediatric gastroenterology subspecialty program. Responsibility for training in endoscopy should be in the hands of university professors and at well supported teaching hospitals and medical centers. The training time for basic endoscopy should be two years while advanced endoscopy requires at least another year and should be targeted towards a specific advanced field. © 2012 Asociaciones Colombianas de Gastroenterología, Endoscopia digestiva, Coloproctología y Hepatología.",Article,"Unknown.; Unknown.; Flores, Nadia Sofia.; Acosta, Alix Yineth Forero.; Canadas, Raul.; Unknown.; Unknown.; Unknown",Colombia;Digestive diseases;Endoscopy consensus;Endoscopy training;Quality of endoscopy,Colombia;Digestive diseases;Endoscopy consensus;Endoscopy training;Quality of endoscopy,Colombia;Colombia;Colombia;Colombia;Colombia;Colombia,
,,,0,2-s2.0-84879775761,2013,"First Colombian consensus on the practice of endoscopy ""fundamental agreement"" (Part two: Ethics)","given widespread distribution and great importance in education. Ethics is always mentioned, but is little studied or investigated. The Colombian Association of Digestive Endoscopy (ACED) devotes the second part of the ""Fundamental Agreement"" consensus to the ethical practice of gastrointestinal endoscopy. We approach this topic from an analysis of the resolution of real dilemmas that arise in endoscopic scenarios shaping our practice. This is the way of conceptually appropriating ethical principles and moral values that should permeate the practice of specialists who rely on endoscopy. It is important to note that the end result is not intended to standardize the conduct of doctors. To the contrary, we propose to carry out an ongoing reflection about the continuous conflicts that arise in our specialty which should not be resolved without profound ethical and moral consideration. Materials and methods: This consensus is a social research study. It uses a descriptive and cross-sectional approach which mixes qualitative and quantitative analysis and is based on the Delphi Method. The information used was obtained during the ""Fundamental Agreement"" event held on June 23, 2012 by the Colombian Association of Digestive Endoscopy (ACED). Qualitative data were taken from four roundtable discussions in which the 34 participants discussed the 21 proposed ethical dilemmas. Quantitative data used include the final voting, individual private electronic surveys. Consensus was defined as agreement of 75% or more of participants. Speech analysis was used for qualitative analysis. It was oriented around from five variables related to moral and ethical aspects of the practice of endoscopy. For quantitative analysis, basic descriptive statistics centered on percentages were used. Results: Some of the consensus obtained were: 80.65% agreed to consult with the group that they replace in a particular institution; 80.54% shared the opinion that the type of contract limited research, educational, institutional and even personal development; 78.12% agreed that recognition of group work prevails over recognition of individual work in intellectual production, 100% agreed every individual involved in writing and publication should receive individual credit for their work; 80.64% agreed that the relationship of the patient to the health system determined the kind of attention that is given, and 90.82% agreed that the quality of care was affected by the number of patients who require care. Conclusions: The Colombian consensus agrees that resolution of ethical dilemmas that arise in real-world scenarios in the practice of endoscopy should consider ethical and moral values specifically related to the particular situation faced by the specialist. Thus, conflicts related to contractual or employment issues have to consider the dignity of, and respect for, colleagues. Similarly, equality and justice as values and principles that prevail within these scenarios must be considered. Intellectual property rights require responsibility and honesty as guiding principles when situations of group or individual recognition are confronted. Endoscopists' professional relationships with patients should be framed within values and ethics including prudence, humanity, truthfulness, and choosing the lesser evil. In turn, the specialist's relations with her or his team should respect collegiality, autonomy, the right to an individual's good name, dignity and equality. A culture that promotes ethics, responsibility, humanity and charity must prevail for ethical training. © 2013 Asociaciones Colombianas de Gastroenterología, Endoscopia digestiva, Coloproctología y Hepatología.",Article,"Unknown.; Martin, Diego Aponte.; Acosta, Alix Yineth Forero.; Flores, Nadia Sofia.; Canadas, Raul.; Unknown.; Unknown.; Unknown",Colombia;Consensus on endoscopy;Ethical principles;Ethics in gastroenterology and endoscopy;Medical ethics;Moral values;Training in ethics,Colombia;Consensus on endoscopy;Ethical principles;Ethics in gastroenterology and endoscopy;Medical ethics;Moral values;Training in ethics,Colombia;Colombia;Colombia;Colombia;Colombia;Colombia,

Helicobacter pylori (H. pylori) is the cause of most peptic ulcers and gastric cancers. Many experts recommend routine investigation and eradication of the infection before RYGB. The prevalence of H. pylori and endoscopic alterations among patients scheduled for RYGB had not been studied before in our environment, so we decided to conduct this research. Materials and methods: Severely obese adult patients with no gastric symptoms who were scheduled for RYGB and preoperative upper endoscopy were included in this study. Results: From March 2007 to July 2014, 83 patients were included. 87.95% were women. Mean age was 46.9 +/- 11.4 years (17-62 years). H. pylori was found in 57.83% (95% CI 47.09 - 66.96%) which is similar to  the percentage of infections found in people who are not obese. 60% had some degree of erosive esophagitis including esophageal varices in two patients, and GIST in one patient. None had severe atrophy (OLGA III or IV). Conclusion: All patients had some alterations found during endoscopy. Two patients had esophageal varices. The prevalence of H. pylori is similar to that among people who are not obese.

In 2018, it ranked sixth and represented the fourth cause of death from cancer; the five-year overall survival is 18 %. Most cases of HCC develop in patients with cirrhosis of any etiology, especially because of hepatitis B and C viruses, alcohol, and recently nonalcoholic steatohepatitis (NASH). Aim: To analyze the clinical characteristics, diagnostic methods, treatments, prognostic variables, and survival. Materials and methods: This retrospective descriptive study was conducted on a cohort of patients diagnosed with cirrhosis and treated between January 2011 and December 2020 at a health care center in Bogotá. The diagnosis of HCC was confirmed radiologically or by biopsy. We analyzed the information descriptively with absolute frequency measures in the case of categorical variables. For continuous variables, the information was summarized with measures of central tendency (mean or median) and their relevant measures of dispersion. Results: We included 152 patients diagnosed with HCC, with a mean age of 69.4 years; 51.3 % were men. The leading cause of HCC was nonalcoholic fatty liver disease (NAFLD), which accounted for almost a third of cases (32 %); other causes were alcohol (15 %) and hepatitis C virus (14 %). The median manifestation of the tumor was two nodules with a size close to 4 cm. Besides, 35 % of patients had a BCLC (Barcelona Clinic Liver Cancer) stage with curative options, and 25 % received curative treatment options. The first-line systemic therapy used in this cohort was sorafenib®, used in 35 patients (33.7 %). Survival curves showed that women, Child-Pugh class A, and BCLC stage 0 had higher median survival. Multivariate analysis showed a higher risk of death for males (hazard ratio [HR]: 2.16; confidence interval [CI]: 1.24–3.76), Child-Pugh class B (HR: 2.14; CI 1.16–3.95), and Child-Pugh class C (HR: 7.52; CI 2.88–19.57). Conclusions: NAFLD is the leading cause of HCC in this cohort. A third of patients are diagnosed in early BCLC stages with a curative treatment option, and 25 % are treated with curative therapies. Sorafenib was the first-line therapy in advanced HCC. Overall survival after diagnosis of HCC remains low, being necessary to join forces in the follow-up of patients with cirrhosis to improve these outcomes.",Article,"Unknown.; Garzon-Orjuela, Nathaly.; Sanchez-Pardo, Santiago.; Prieto-Ortiz, Robin.; Eslava-Schmalbach, Javier",Hepatocellular carcinoma;real life;sorafenib;survival,Hepatocellular carcinoma;real life;sorafenib;survival,Colombia;Colombia;Colombia;Colombia;Colombia,

Difficult bile duct stones of over 15 mm diameter cause choledocholithiasis in significant numbers of patients. This condition requires the use of techniques such as mechanical lithotripsy (ML) which are more complex than sphincterotomy and which also require more time to accomplish. This increases the potential for complications. Objective. To describe our experience with attempted papillary dilations with large balloons to treat difficult bile duct stones. Design. Observational study. Descriptive research. Case series. Results. Endoscopic retrograde cholangiopancreatography (ERCP) and LBPD procedures were attempted in 20 patients aged 43 to 91. Of these patients 11 were men, and 14 were women. ERCPs and ESTs had previously been performed on 14 of these patients (70%), while this was the first time for the other 6 patients (30%). Indications for performing LBPDs were bile duct stones ≥ 15 mm in 11 patients (55%), disproportion between common the bile duct and the papillary orifice in 12 patients (60%), and both conditions in 3 patients (15%). The total success rate for resolution of choledocholithiasis was 95%. Removal of bile duct stones in a single session was accomplished in 17 patients (85%) while two additional sessions each were required to remove the stones in two patients (10%). It was not possible to completely remove one patient's stones (5%) endoscopically. Only 7 patients (35%) required lithotripsy. The total complication rate was estimated at approximately 10%. One patient (5%) presented a small amount of bleeding after the sphincterotomy, but no intervention was required. Another patient (5%) presented a mild post-ERCP pancreatitis which evolved satisfactorily. Conclusions. This is the first case series report of the use of LBPD to treat difficult bile duct stones as a new alternative for resolving choledocholithiasis. It obtained a 95% success rate. Thanks to this technique, we avoided treatment with mechanical lithotripsy in 65% of these cases and also obtained an acceptable rate of complications. The clinical findings reported in this study correlate well other case series reports and clinical trials published in the literature.

Chronic laryngitis is one of the symptoms most often associated with GERD, yet various studies which have used monitoring esophageal pH as a diagnostic tool have not found any clear association between chronic laryngitis and reflux. Moreover, studies which have treated patients suspected of having chronic laryngitis caused by reflux with proton pump inhibitors (PPIs) have had had rates of therapeutic failures. Symptoms continue to persist in these patients despite adequate inhibition of acid secretion. To date, no evidence exists of the association between chronic laryngitis and GERD, much less evidence of a causal relation. We consider that, although GERD may be responsible for some episodes of chronic laryngitis, it is not the illness most frequently associated with it, and in the many cases in which GERD has been reasonably ruled out, other potential causes must be investigated. © 2011 Asociaciones Colombianas de Gastroenterología, Endoscopia digestiva, Coloproctología y Hepatología.",Article,"de Ardila, Albis Hani.; Unknown",Chronic laryngitis;Esophageal pH monitoring;Gastroesophageal reflux disease (GERD);Proton pump inhibitor (PPIs),Chronic laryngitis;Esophageal pH monitoring;Gastroesophageal reflux disease (GERD);Proton pump inhibitor (PPIs),Colombia,

Methodology: A descriptive study was carried out in a cohort of 54 patients diagnosed with gastric cancer who underwent gastrectomy between 2014 and 2017. Sociodemographic information was taken from the medical records of the patients. The Sydney system and Lauren classification were used to determine histopathological characteristics. Results: Most tumors were found in men older than 50 years (with a male:female ratio of 2.6:1). The predominant location was the antropyloric region. The most frequent tumor histotype was intestinal (80 %). The prevalence of Helicobacter pylori in patients was 24.07 % and it was most commonly found in the intestinal histotype. Intestinal metaplasia was the most prevalent premalignant lesion in all tumor histotypes. Conclusions: The present study found that the age of 50 and the male sex are conditions associated with gastric cancer. This finding has already been demonstrated in previous studies. Progress in improving public health conditions, controlling H. pylori infection, and early screening of premalignant lesions is imperative, as they are determining factors of carcinogenesis in patients with non-cardia carcinomas and intestinal histotypes located in the anthrocorporal region.

The asymptomatic elevation of transaminases is typical in the liver, and liver involvement varies from 14 % to 78 %. The assessment of liver comorbidities is scarce, with prevalence ranging between 2 % and 11 %. Aim: To describe the behavior of a cohort of patients with liver diseases who fell ill with coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19). Materials and methods: This retrospective observational study analyzed the behavior of a cohort of patients with liver diseases who fell ill with COVID-19. Results: 543 patients became ill with COVID-19, of which 300 were women (55.3 %). The median age at diagnosis of liver disease was 52 years. The leading causes of liver disease were nonalcoholic steatohepatitis (49.5 %), cholestatic disease (7.7 %), and hepatitis C and B viruses (6.3 %). Alanine aminotransferase (ALT) had a median of 52 U/L (interquartile range [IQR]: 30–98) and aspartate aminotransferase (AST) 32 U/L (IQR: 23–62). Mortality due to viral infection was 5.7 %, with an incidence rate of 2.9 (95 % confidence interval [CI]: 2–4.2). Conclusions: It is a retrospective study but, until the preparation of the manuscript, it had been the first cohort in Colombia to describe the behavior of liver diseases in patients who become ill with COVID-19.

We propose a new scene flow approach that exploits the local and piecewise rigidity of real world scenes. By modeling the motion as a field of twists, our method encourages piecewise smooth solutions of rigid body motions. We give a general formulation to solve for local and global rigid motions by jointly using intensity and depth data. In order to deal efficiently with a moving camera, we model the motion as a rigid component plus a non-rigid residual and propose an alternating solver. The evaluation demonstrates that the proposed method achieves the best results in the most commonly used scene flow benchmark.

Although PS systems have the potential to collect enormous amounts of data to discover and solve new collective problems, they have not been very successful in practice, mainly because of lack of incentives for participation and privacy concerns. Therefore, several incentive and privacy-preserving mechanisms have been proposed. However, these mechanisms have been traditionally studied in isolation overseeing the interaction between them. In this paper we include a model and implement several of these mechanisms to study the interactions and effects that they may have on one another and, more importantly, on the quality of the information that the system provides to the final user.

We present a denotational semantics based on a (continuous) immediate consequence operator, TD, which models the process behaviour associated with a program V given in terms of sequences of constraints. Then, we show that, given the intended specification of D, it is possible to check the correctness of V by a single step of TD. In order to develop an effective debugging method. we approximate the denotational semantics of D. We formalize this method by abstract interpretation techniques, and we derive a finitely terminating abstract diagnosis method, which can be used statically. We define an abstract domain which allows us to approximate the infinite sequences by a finite 'cut'. As a further development we show how to use a specific linear temporal logic for deriving automatically the debugging sequences. Our debugging framework does not require the user to either provide error symptoms in advance or answer questions concerning program correctness.

However, they have been traditionally avoided in embedded real-time systems due to their lack of determinism. Unfortunately, most of the techniques to attain predictability on caches are complex to apply, precluding their use on real applications. This work reviews several techniques developed by the authors to use cache memories in ""real"" embedded real-time systems, with the ease of use in mind. Those techniques are based on a locking cache, which offers a very predictable behaviour. Both static and dynamic use are proposed as well as the algorithms and methods required to make the schedulability analysis using two different scheduling policies. Also proposed is a genetic algorithm that finds, within acceptable computational cost, the sub-optimal set of instructions that must be preloaded in cache. Finally, a set of statistical analyses compares the locking cache versus a conventional one. © Springer-Verlag Berlin Heidelberg 2005.",Conference Paper,"Marti Campoy, A.; Unknown.; Unknown.; Unknown.; Unknown",Cache memories;Embedded real-time systems;Execution time;Genetic al-gorithms;Performance evaluation;Predictability;Response time;Schedulability analysis,Cache memories;Embedded real-time systems;Execution time;Genetic al-gorithms;Performance evaluation;Predictability;Response time;Schedulability analysis,Colombia;Spain,

The method is the identifies the parameters of each cylinder piece from a series of planar contours extracted along an approximate axis of the artery.

The identification of the axial parameters is based on a geometrical analogy with piece-wise helical curves, while the identification of the surface parameters uses the Fourier series decomposition of the contours. Thus identified parameters are used as observations in a Kalman optimal estimation scheme that manages the spatial consistency from each piece to another.

This paper presents guarded terms, an approach to deal with this problem for rewriting modulo SMT. Guarded terms can encode many symbolic states into one by using SMT constraints as part of the term structure.

It relies on a workflow-based language that allows for the modeling of the control-flow graph of an entire process. In this paper, the main focus is on an extension of BPMN with data, which is convenient for describing real-world processes involving complex behavior and data descriptions. By considering this level of expressiveness due to the new features, challenging questions arise regarding the choice of the semantic framework for specifying such an extension of BPMN, as well as how to carry out the symbolic simulation, validation, and correctness of the process models. These issues are addressed first by providing a symbolic executable rewriting logic semantics of BPMN using the rewriting modulo SMT framework, where the execution is driven by rewriting modulo axioms and by querying SMT decision procedures for data conditions. Second, reachability properties, such as deadlock freedom and detection of unreachable states with data exhibiting certain values, can be specified and automatically checked with the help of Maude, thanks to its support for rewriting modulo SMT.

An important measure when developing a business process is the degree of parallelism, namely, the maximum number of tasks that are executable in parallel at any given time in a process.

Widely-used applications of blockchain include digital currencies such as Bitcoin and Ethereum. This paper proposes an algorithmic approach to analyze the efficiency of a blockchain as a function of the number of blocks and the average synchronization delay. The proposed algorithms consider a random network model that characterizes the growth of a tree of blocks by adhering to a standard protocol. The model is parametric on two probability distribution functions governing block production and communication delay. Both distributions determine the synchronization efficiency of the distributed copies of the blockchain among the so- called workers and, therefore, are key for capturing the overall stochastic growth. Moreover, the algorithms consider scenarios with a fixed or an unbounded number of workers in the network. The main result illustrates how the algorithms can be used to evaluate different types of blockchain designs, e.g., systems in which the average time of block production can match the average time of message broadcasting required for synchronization. In particular, this algorithmic approach provides insight into efficiency criteria for identifying conditions under which increasing block production has a negative impact on the stability of a blockchain. The model and algorithms are agnostic of the blockchain’s final use, and they serve as a formal framework for specifying and analyzing a variety of non-functional properties of current and future blockchains.",Conference Paper,"Pinzon, Carlos.; Rocha, Camilo.; Finke, Jorge",,,Colombia,

Agents evolve by updating their beliefs (opinions) based on an underlying influence graph, as in the standard DeGroot model for social learning, but under a confirmation bias; i.e., a discounting of opinions of agents with dissimilar views. We show that even under this bias polarization eventually vanishes (converges to zero) if the influence graph is strongly-connected. If the influence graph is a regular symmetric circulation, we determine the unique belief value to which all agents converge. Our more insightful result establishes that, under some natural assumptions, if polarization does not eventually vanish then either there is a disconnected subgroup of agents, or some agent influences others more than she is influenced. We also show that polarization does not necessarily vanish in weakly-connected graphs under confirmation bias. We illustrate our model with a series of case studies and simulations, and show how it relates to the classic DeGroot model for social learning.",Conference Paper,"Alvim, Mario S.; Unknown.; Unknown.; Quintero, Santiago.; Unknown",Confirmation bias;Multi-agent systems;Polarization;Social networks,Confirmation bias;Multi-agent systems;Polarization;Social networks,Colombia;Brazil;France;United States,

These methods are used to measure the mean density of seven main anatomical zones of the mandible, making the difference between cortical and cancellous bone. The results lead to determine the normal density values in each region of the inferior maxillary bone and help to evaluate the success of the bone regeneration process. The proposed method was validated on ten axial slices from different zones of a patient mandible, by comparing automatic classification results with those obtained by expert manual classification. A 4% mean difference was found between percentages of bone tissue types, and the mean difference between mean density values was of 88 HU. Once the method was validated, it was applied to measure density in the seven anatomical zones of the inferior maxillary bone. © 2010 Springer-Verlag Berlin Heidelberg.",Conference Paper,"Unknown.; Caicedo, Sandra L.; Unknown.; Unknown.; Unknown.; Unknown.; Hoyos, Marcela Hernandez",,,Colombia;Colombia,

For example, the accurate computation of the derivatives is often hampered in medical images by the presence of noise and a limited resolution, affecting the accuracy of segmentation methods. In our case, we want to obtain an upper air-ways segmentation, so it is necessary to compute the first derivatives as accurately as possible, in order to use gradient-based segmentation techniques.

The composer defines the temporal organization of the score by asserting temporal relations (TRs) between temporal objects (TOs). At execution time, the performer may modify the start/stop times of the TOs by triggering interaction points and the system guarantees that all the TRs are satisfied. Implementations of IS and formal models of their behavior have already been proposed, but these do not provide usable means to reason about their properties. In this paper we introduce ReactiveIS, a programming language that fully captures the temporal structure of IS during both composition and execution. For that, we propose a semantics based on tree-like structures representing the execution state of the score at each point in time. The semantics captures the hierarchical aspects of IS and provides an intuitive representation of their execution. We also endow ReactiveIS with a logical semantics based on linear logic, thus widening the reasoning techniques available for IS. We show that ReactiveIS is general enough to capture the full behavior of IS and it also provides declarative ways to increase the expressivity of IS with, for instance, conditional statements and loops.",Conference Paper,"Unknown.; Desainte-Catherine, Myriam.; Olarte, Carlos.; Rueda, Camilo",,,France;Colombia;Brazil,

Participating in this project implied active dialogue with the community to recognize the knowledge of each participant and achieve culturally relevant representations materialized in technological artifacts. We posit dialogue, representation and recognition as key elements for developing successful participatory design. In practice, this was achieved through an iterative, incremental and open-ended methodology, whose main feature was engagement by doing. This process of design allowed engineers to recognize the craftswomen’s traditional knowledge and allowed craftswomen to be less afraid of technology. The main resultant artifact was a tangible user interface that facilitates dialogue between fashion designers and embroiderers in the process of designing new embroidery patterns. This and other artifacts that emerged from the activities and dialogues, the level of engagement of the participants, and the convergence points discovered between embroidery and technology, lead us to conclude that the process presented here can be replicated with other craft communities, to reinforce these communities and assist them in generating innovation in their processes and products.",Conference Paper,"Unknown.; Piedrahita-Solorzano, Giovanny",Crafts;Dialogue;Embroidery;Participatory design;Recognition;Representation;Tangible user interfaces and social technologies,Crafts;Dialogue;Embroidery;Participatory design;Recognition;Representation;Tangible user interfaces and social technologies,Colombia;Colombia,

These contexts are typical of large scale Virtual Organizations (VO) where autonomous organizations share data about a group of domain concepts (e.g. patient, gene). The instances of such concepts are constructed from non-disjointed fragments provided by several local data sources. Such sources overlap in a non mastered way making data location uncertain. This fact, in addition to the absence of reliable statistics on source contents and the large number of sources, make current proposals unsuitable in terms of response quality and/or response time. OptiSource optimizes source selection by taking advantage of organizational aspects of VOs to predict the benefit of using a source. It uses an optimization model to distinguish the sets of sources that maximize benefits and minimize the number of sources to contact to while satisfying resource constraints. The precision and recall of source selection is highly improved as demonstrated by the tests performed with the OptiSource prototype. © 2010 Springer-Verlag.",Conference Paper,"Pomares-Quimbaya, Alexandra.; Roncancio, Claudia.; Unknown.; Unknown.; Unknown",Combinatorial Optimization;Large Scale Data Mediation;Source Selection,Combinatorial Optimization;Large Scale Data Mediation;Source Selection,Colombia;Colombia;France,

Anisotropic diffusion filtering concentrates on preservation of important surface features, such as sharp edges and corners, by applying direction dependent smoothing. This feature is very important in image smoothing, edge detection, image segmentation and image enhancement. For instance, in the image segmentation case, it is necessary to smooth images as accurately as possible in order to use gradient-based segmentation methods. If image edges are seriously polluted by noise, these methods would not be able to detect them, so edge features cannot be retained. The aim of this paper is to present a comparative study of three methods that have been used for smoothing using anisotropic diffusion techniques.

One of the main components of metaheuristic algorithms is the solution representation (codification) since all search strategies are implemented based on it.

We hypothesise that there exists a hierarchical relationship between modalities: echocardiography is more accessible and has a lower economical cost than other modalities (like magnetic resonance imaging (MRI)). The framework consists of two classifier models, each predicting the illness from the echocardiographic and MRI views, and a sample-weighting model that combines both predictions. This weighting model is used to decide which individuals will not need an MRI acquisition additional to the echocardiographic examination. We illustrated this on a dataset of asymptomatic individuals with an echocardiographic study (N = 480), a subset of those also includes a MRI (N = 159). We analyse the effect of being overweight on cardiac geometry. We identified that the type of remodelling depended on blood pressure: overweight combined with high blood pressure resulted in an increase of ventricular mass, while only size changes were preserved for low-pressure individuals.

For equational functional programs such determinism is exactly captured by the ground confluence property. For terminating equations this is equivalent to ground local confluence, which follows from local confluence. Checking local confluence by computing critical pairs is the standard way to check ground confluence. The problem is that some perfectly reasonable equational programs are not locally confluent and it can be very hard or even impossible to make them so by adding more equations. We propose a three-step strategy to prove that an equational program as is is ground confluent: First: apply the strategy proposed in [9] to use non-joinable critical pairs as completion hints to either achieve local confluence or reduce the number of critical pairs. Second: use the inductive inference system proposed in this paper to prove the remaining critical pairs ground joinable. Third: to show ground confluence of the original specification, prove also ground joinable the equations added.

Symbolic rewrite steps with → R capture all possible traces from ground instances of the source state to the ground instances of the target state.

One of the main challenges in this context is concerned with the problem of optimising the allocation and sharing of resources. In this work, processes are described using the BPMN notation extended with an explicit description of execution time and resources associated with tasks, and can be concurrently executed multiple times. First, a simulation-based approach for computing certain metrics of interest, such as average execution time or resource usage, is presented. This approach applies off-line and is static in the sense that the number of resources does not evolve over the time of the simulation. In a second step, an alternative approach is presented, which works online, thus requiring the instrumentation of an existing platform for retrieving information of interest during the processes’ execution. This second approach is dynamic because the number of resource replicas is updated over the time of the execution. This paper aims at stressing pros and cons of both approaches, and at showing how they complement each other.",Conference Paper,"Duran, Francisco.; Falcone, Ylies.; Rocha, Camilo.; Unknown.; Unknown",,,France;Colombia;Spain,

Such organizations are characterized by a challenging data context involving a large number of distributed data sources with strong heterogeneity and uncontrolled data overlapping. In that context, data source selection during query evaluation is particularly important and complex. To cope with this task, we propose OptiSource, an original strategy for source selection using combinatorial optimization techniques combined to organizational knowledge of the virtual organization. Experiment numerical results show that OptiSource is a robust strategy that improves the precision and the recall of the source selection process.

This dependency rises complexity of maintenance of the system and therefore the reliability of the metadata itself. This article presents MetaExtractor, a system which extracts structure, quality, capability and content metadata of structured data sources available on a mediation system. MetaExtractor is designed as a Multi-Agent System(MAS) where each agent specializes in the extraction of a particular type of metadata. The MAS cooperation capability allows the creation and maintenance of the metadata repository. MetaExtractor is useful to reduce the number of data sources selected during query planning in large scale mediation systems due to its ability to prioritize data sources that better contribute to answer a query. The work reported in this paper presents the general architecture of MetaExtractor and emphasizes on the extraction logic of content metadata and the strategy used to prioritize data sources accordingly to a given query. © 2013 IFIP International Federation for Information Processing.",Conference Paper,"Pomares-Quimbaya, Alexandra.; Torres Moreno, Miguel Eduardo.; Unknown",Large Scale Data Mediation;Mediation Systems;Metadata Extraction;Multi-Agent System;Source Selection,Large Scale Data Mediation;Mediation Systems;Metadata Extraction;Multi-Agent System;Source Selection,Colombia,

These techniques are used to simplify the CSP before or during the search for its solutions. Some of the most efficient algorithms for AC computation are AC6++ and AC-7. The novelty of these algorithms is that they satisfy the so-called four desirable properties for AC computation. The main purpose of these interesting properties is to reduce as far as possible the number of constraint checks during AC computation while keeping a reasonable space complexity. In this paper we prove that, despite providing a remarkable reduction in the number of constraint checks, the four desirable properties do not guarantee a minimal number of constraint checks. We therefore refute the minimality claim in the paper introducing these properties. Furthermore, we propose a new desirable property for AC computation and extend AC6++ and AC-7 to consider such a property. We show theoretically and experimentally that the new property provides a further substantial reduction in the number of constraint checks. © Springer-Verlag 2004.",Article,"Rueda, Camilo.; Unknown",,,Colombia;Sweden,

Objectives: The aims of this study were to quantify basal and post methionine load levels of homocysteine in a Colombian healthy population and to identify the frequencies of the allelic variants c.699 C>T (exon 6), c. 1080 C>T (exon 10)of CBS, and c.677 C>T (exon 1) of MTHFR. Association studies between these allelic variants and hiperhomocisteinemia were performed. Methods: A group of 102 healthy in dividuals, without geographic origin, ethnic group or social-economic stratification were studied for polymorphisms c.699 C>T (CBS exon 6), c.1080 C>T (CBS exon 10) and c.677 C>T (MTHFR exon 1) by restriction analysis and the allele frequencies were calculated. Association study was performed using Fisher exact test. Results: Quantification of basal homocysteine levels (10.52 μM + 5.8) and after methionine load (30.14+16,20) was performed. Among individuals 8 were identified with moderate hyperhomocysteinemia, one having basal and the seven post methionine load. Post methionine load in males produced values of 32.43 + 8.64 and were significantly different from that of females (p-0.006) who had values of 28.03 + 7.02. Our results showed that homozygous individuals (TT) for the 677 C/T variant have a risk of 5.14 (odds ratio, p=0.034) of being hyperhomocysteinemic. Conclusions: Hyperhomocysteinemic patients were identified by methionine load test. A positive association between homozygous of the polymorphism 677 of MTHFR was found.

Abnormal levels are also related to birth defects, pregnancy complications, cancer and toxicity to methotrexate (MTX). Polymorphisms of MTHFR affect the activity of the enzyme. Genetic associations have been related to treatment efficacy. Objective: To establish the frequency of the C>T polymorphism at nucleotide 677 of the MTHFR gene in a group of Colombian individuals. Methods: Data from pharmacogenetic microarrays that include MTX sensibility-associated polymorphisms were retrospectively collected (Pathway Genomics (R)). The frequency of the C>T MTHFR rs1801133 marker polymorphism was analyzed. Results: Microarray data from 68 men and 84 women were analyzed. Comparisons of genotype C/C vs. C/T and T/T were statistically significantly different (p= 0.00, p= 0.026, respectively), as were C/T and T/T (p= 0.0001). Conclusions: Results for the C/C and C/T genotypes in a Colombian population are similar to other previously studied groups of healthy subjects.

The morbility index associated with the IAD in children under five years of age, involves between 2.6% and 3.3% episodes/child/year, with mortality index of 3.2 millions per year. Most of the epidemiological studies have been performed in countries belonging to temperate zones but little is known concerning the tropics, where this infection is endemic. Objectives: The aim of this study was to contribute to the knowledge of the IAD in Colombia comparing two geographic and climatically different regions, one located at the Caribbean coast (Cartagena) and another of the central highland (Facatativa). We analyzed the etiology of the two regions identifying the source of the infection. Material and methods: Diarrheic samples from children under five years of age who had medical assistance in local hospitals were collected during 14 months. Bacteria were isolated in selective media and typified with biochemical methods. The presence of viruses was detected with immunoassay commercial kits. Analyses of independent variables (age, gender, temperature, rainfall and humidity) were evaluated with bivariated and Z tests and correlated with the presence of the infection in both regions. Results: The predominance of viral diarrhea was higher in both regions (29.2% and 21.4%) compared with the bacterial source of infections (16% and 15 %) for Cartagena and Facatativá, respectively. Rotavirus was the most frequent pathogen with prevalences around 24.8% and 18%, respectively. Astrovirus and enteric adenovirus had prevalences below 3%. There were no significant statistic differences between the regions studied accounting for the infection or supporting that different climate conditions or child characteristics could be associated with diarrhea. However, the Z test showed that rotavirus and in general, all viral infections follow different patterns when analyzed comparatively in both regions. © 2005 Corporación Editora Médica del Valle.",Article,"Gutierrez, M.

The existing assessment measures are limited and deficient; hence, the development of new tools considering gender differences is important. Method: The study was instrumental (psychometric). The sample was composed of 121 women with HIV/aids attending 8 health-service facilities in the city of Cali and taking antiretroviral medication. The psychometric properties assessed were the content validity, the items discrimination ability, the factorial structure as an index to construct validity, and the reliability of the CAT-M VIH. Results: The questionnaire was finally composed of 17 items, which reflect adherence behavior to pharmacological treatment, to nonpharmacological and self-care aspects, to the prevention of sexually transmitted diseases advice, and to drug use restrictions. The preliminary psychometric properties are acceptable, having good reliability (a=0.634) and good internal structure. The items have adequate discrimination indexes and clinical relevance.

Seventeen (17) tandem repeat polymorphisms in the Y chromosome were amplified and typed (DYS456, DYS389I, DYS390, DYS389II, DYS458, DYS19, DYS385a/b, DYS393, DYS391, DYS439, DYS635, DYS392, Y-GATA-H4, DYS437, DYS438, and DYS448). Results: Distribution of allele and haplotype frequencies for the 17 markers were analyzed: 71 haplotypes were determined with 17 Y-STR markers of which 68 were unique and 3 were observed in two individuals, with a single shared haplotype for the two departments of the Cundiboyacense Plateau. The haplotype diversity for the sample population was 99.9% with a discrimination power of 95.9% and random match probability of 1.5%. The comparison of the two populations together had no significant differences, and therefore no regional specificity was found in allele frequencies between Cundinamarca and Boyaca. Discussion: The values of haplotype diversity, discrimination power, and probability of random coincidence showed the usefulness of Y-STR analysis in cases of patrilineal descent and are consistent with values observed in the early development of haplotype databases. Conclusion: The data analysis of the 17-Y STR markers obtained in this study provide haplotypes for the Cundiboyacense highlands, one of the most significant concentrations of population in Colombia, and serves as an informative database for forensic practice and genetic studies for human populations.",Article,"Rojas, K.M.; Roa, M.; Briceno, I.; Guaneme, C.; Gomez, A.",Y-Chromosome; Haplotype; STR-Y; Haplotype diversity; Colombia,Y-Chromosome;Haplotype;STR-Y;Haplotype diversity;Colombia;FORENSIC ANALYSIS;POPULATION;GENETICS;DYS438;UPDATE,Colombia,

Objective: To estimate the prevalence of HBP, knowledge, treatment and control in population aged >= 60 years, resident in Colombia, according to their ethnic condition. Methods: Population sample selected by multistage sampling. Ethnicity was defined based on skin color. HBP was defined as systolic blood pressure >= 140, and/or diastolic blood pressure >= 90 mm Hg, and/or the participants' self-report. Controlled HBP at a blood pressure value < 140/90, knowledge and treatment were identified by self-report. Results: 23,694 adults aged >= 60 years were included, of which 54.5%, 34.5% and 10.9% were respectively identified as having light, medium or dark skin color; 54.5% were women, and 78.1% resided in urban areas. The standardized prevalence of HBP, by age, was 57.7% (95% CI: 55.2 -60.2); 51.4% (95% CI: 47.3-55. 5), in men; and 62.9% (60.964.9), in women. The standardized prevalence for light, medium and dark skin in men was 53.2% (95% CI: 48.7-57.7), 49.6% (44.5-54.7), and 49.4% (95% CI: 41.0-57.8) respectively; and in women was 62.5% (95% CI: 60.5-64, 5), 61.7% (95% CI: 57.865.6), and 69.9% (95% CI: 63.6-76.2) respectively. 98% of the population received treatment, and 93.9% were aware of HBP diagnosis. 42.5% of men and 55.5% of women with HBP were under control.

These analyses must be performed with special care because of the low DNA concentrations and contamination risk; therefore, it is necessary to establish protocols to guarantee the reproducibility and veracity of results. Objective: The present study aims to establish a protocol to obtain ancient DNA from 16 pre-Columbian bone samples found in an excavation performed in the area ""Candelaria La Nueva"" in Bogota, Colombia, dated in the period ""Muisca Tardio"". Methods: Four founder mitochondrial DNA Amerindian haplotypes were analyzed by high resolution restriction enzyme analyses, obtaining fragments between 121 and 186 base pairs (bp). Different analyses were performed following a strict control of authenticity criteria regarding laboratory conditions, including: positive and negative controls, reproducibility of results, and verification of particular characteristics present in ancient DNA. Results: Results obtained from the bone samples showed the exclusive presence of haplogroup A in the population studied.

They are also related to birth defects, pregnancy complications, cancer and toxicity to Methotrexate (MTX). Polymorphisms of MTHFR affect the activity of the enzyme. Genetic associations have been related to treatment efficacy. Objective: To establish the frequency of the polymorphism C> T at nucleotide 677 of the MTHFR gene in a group of Colombian individuals Methods: Data of pharmacogenetic microarrays which include MTX sensibility associated polymorphisms were collected retrospectively (Pathway Genomics®). The frequency of the polymorphism C> T MTHFR rs1801133 marker polymorphism was analyzed. Results: Microarrays from 68 men and 84 women were analyzed.

We performed a concordance study of five methodologies for the species identification of oral isolates of Candida in Colombia. Methods: Sixty-seven Candida isolates were tested by; API (R) 20C-AUX, Vitek (R) 2 Compact, Vitek (R) MS, Microflex (R) and a molecular test (panfungal PCR and sequencing). The commercial cost and processing time of the samples was done by graphical analysis. Results: Panfungal PCR differentiated 12 species of Candida, Vitek (R) MS and Microflex (R) methods identified 9 species, and API (R) 20C-AUX and Vitek (R) 2 Compact methods identified 8 species each. Weighted Kappa (wK) showed a high agreement between Panfungal PCR, Vitek (R) MS, Microflex (R) and API (R) 20C-AUX (wK 0.62-0.93).

Due to the lack of anti-COVID-19 therapies, decision-makers require timely and accurate data to estimate the incidence of disease and the availability of hospital resources to contain the pandemic. Methods: We adapted an existing model to the local context to forecast COVID-19 incidence and hospital resource use assuming different scenarios: (1) the implementation of quarantine from September 1st to October 15th (average daily growth rate of 2%); (2-3) partial restrictions (at 4% and 8% growth rates); and (4) no restrictions, assuming a 10% growth rate. Previous scenarios with predictions from June to August were also presented. We estimated the number of new cases, diagnostic tests required, and the number of available hospital and intensive care unit (ICU) beds (with and without ventilators) for each scenario. Results: We estimated 67,700 cases by October 15th when assuming the implementation of a quarantine, 80,400 and 101,500 cases when assuming partial restrictions at 4% and 8% infection rates, respectively, and 208,500 with no restrictions. According to different scenarios, the estimated demand for reverse transcription-polymerase chain reaction tests ranged from 202,000 to 1,610,600 between September 1st and October 15th. The model predicted depletion of hospital and ICU beds by September 20th if all restrictions were to be lifted and the infection growth rate increased to 10%. Conclusion: Slowly lifting social distancing restrictions and reopening the economy is not expected to result in full resource depletion by October if the daily growth rate is maintained below 8%. Increasing the number of available beds provides a safeguard against slightly higher infection rates.

The existing assessment measures are limited and deficient; hence, the development of new tools considering gender differences is important. Method: The study was instrumental (psychometric). The sample was composed of 121 women with HIV/aids attending 8 health-service facilities in the city of Cali and taking antiretroviral medication. The psychometric properties assessed were the content validity, the items discrimination ability, the factorial structure as an index to construct validity, and the reliability of the CAT-M VIH. Results: The questionnaire was finally composed of 17 items, which reflect adherence behavior to pharmacological treatment, to nonpharmacological and self-care aspects, to the prevention of sexually transmitted diseases advice, and to drug use restrictions. The preliminary psychometric properties are acceptable, having good reliability (a=0.634) and good internal structure. The items have adequate discrimination indexes and clinical relevance.

However, the difference in the sociocultural contexts between countries requires the specific adjustment of these estimates to each scenario. This article analyses the main elements used for the construction of models from epidemiological patterns, to describe the interaction, explain the dynamics of infection and recovery, and to predict possible scenarios that may arise with the introduction of public health measures such as social distancing and quarantines, specifically in the case of the pandemic unleashed by the new SARS-CoV-2/COVID-19 virus. Comment: Mathematical models are highly relevant for making objective and effective decisions to control and eradicate the disease.

Its genetic etiology can be either a duplication (or other gene dosage alterations) or a punctual mutation at the PLP1 locus. Clinically, it presents with developmental delay, nystagmus and, spasticity, supported by neuroimaging in which the defect of myelination is evident. We present a series of seven Colombian patients diagnosed with this leucodystrophy, describing their genotypic and phenotypic characteristics and heterogeneity. Clinical Findings: All patients included were male, 6 months to 16 years of age. Mean age at onset of symptoms was 8 months. Mean age at diagnosis was 5 years 5 months, being classic PMD most frequently diagnosed, as compared to the connatal phenotype. All cases had a primary diagnosis of developmental delay on 100%, and in 28.7% of cases, early onset nystagmus was described. 85.7% of patients had spasticity, 71.4% cerebellar signs, 57.0% hypotonia, and 28.5% had an abnormal movement disorder. Only three patients were able to achieve gait, though altered. In the two patients who had a diagnosis of connatal PMD maturational ages in danger zones according to the WHO Abbreviated Scale of Psychosocial Development were documented. All cases had abnormalities in neuroimages. Molecular Analysis and Results: Molecular studies were used in the majority of the cases to confirm the diagnosis (85.7%). For two cases molecular confirmation was not considered necessary given their affected male brothers had already been tested. PLP1 gene dosage alterations (duplications) were found in 28.5% of the patients (two siblings), whereas three different single nucleotide variants were detected. Clinical Relevance: According to these findings, as authors we propose the diagnostic algorithm in Colombian population to begin on a high clinical suspicion, followed by paraclinical extension, moving on to the molecular confirmation by using approaches to simultaneously sequence the PLP1 gene in order to detect point mutations and in/dels and performing a copy number variation analysis for the detection of gene dosage alterations.",Article,"Parra, H.M.V.; Anaya, S.J.M.; Guio, J.C.A.; Diaz, C.E.A.; Rivera, J.C.P.",Pelizaeus Merzbacher disease; child development; developmental disorders; myelin sheath; Myelin proteolipidic protein; PLP1,Pelizaeus Merzbacher disease;child development;developmental disorders;myelin sheath;Myelin proteolipidic protein;PLP1;PROTEOLIPID PROTEIN GENE;MYELIN;DISORDERS;LEUKODYSTROPHIES;IDENTIFICATION,Colombia,2-s2.0-85051434139

Due to the lack of anti-COVID-19 therapies, decision-makers require timely and accurate data to estimate the incidence of disease and the availability of hospital resources to contain the pandemic. Methods: We adapted an existing model to the local context to forecast COVID-19 incidence and hospital resource use assuming different scenarios: (1) the implementation of quarantine from September 1st to October 15th (average daily growth rate of 2%); (2-3) partial restrictions (at 4% and 8% growth rates); and (4) no restrictions, assuming a 10% growth rate. Previous scenarios with predictions from June to August were also presented. We estimated the number of new cases, diagnostic tests required, and the number of available hospital and intensive care unit (ICU) beds (with and without ventilators) for each scenario. Results: We estimated 67,700 cases by October 15th when assuming the implementation of a quarantine, 80,400 and 101,500 cases when assuming partial restrictions at 4% and 8% infection rates, respectively, and 208,500 with no restrictions.

Typical cytomorphological features of GBM were found in cells of the primary cultures: bipolar or unipolar cells, flat fibroblastoid cells, process-bearing cells with scant cytoplasm and 3 or more processes. It was found a differential expression of the four markers, which had a nuclear and cytoplasmatic staining pattern throughout studied subcultures. Cell line exhibited a high level of aneuploidy with modal chromosomal number between 43-45, with presence of poliploidy (55-102<4n>, XXYY) and endoreduplication (end 45, X, -Y). Conclusion: It was established a GBM derived cell line with a stable phenotype, maintaining morphological cell and cytogenetic characteristics. © 2007 Corporación Editora Médica del Valle.",Article,"Unknown.; Unknown.; Osorio, Gloria.; Unknown.; Unknown",Cell line;Human glioblastoma multiforme;Immunochemistry;Immunocytochemistry,Cell line;Human glioblastoma multiforme;Immunochemistry;Immunocytochemistry,Colombia;Colombia;Colombia,

Design: Historic cohort. Setting: A first level hospital in Cali, Colombia (1989 to 1997); Subjects came from a low socioeconomic stratum population. Study subjects: A total of 287 infants who completed the 1 year follow up program were included. Interventions: not applicable Main outcome measures: Incidence (cumulative and density) of neuromotor abnormalities (abnormal INFANIB test) at 1 year of age. Results: Compliance with program visits was 80%. Thirty nine (13.6%) infants presented low 5 minutes Apgar score. Thirty six (12.5%) infants presented neonatal seizures, associated mainly with neonatal asphyxia and hypoglicemia. Forty seven infants had an abnormal INFANIB test (cumulative incidence 16.4% and incidence density 1.3 new cases per 100 infants-year). A significant association between neonatal seizures and an abnormal INFANIB was found (RR crude 2.39 IC 95% 1.37-4.16). Low 5 minutes Apgar score is not an effect modifier neither a confounder of the association between neonatal seizures and an abnormal INFANIB. Exploring the presence or absence of effect modification only bacterial meningitis, demonstrated a role as confounder for the association between seizures and INFANIB results. Conclusions: Both neonatal seizures and bacterial meningitis were independently associated with abnormal INFANIB results. Neonatal seizures are not only an important risk factor (adjusted RR=2.51 IC 95% 1.10-5.72), but an easily identifiable one that can help the physician taking the medical history to identify patients at high risk for neuromotor abnormalities during the first year of life. © 2006 Corporación Editora Médica del Valle.",Article,"Unknown.; Ruiz-Pelaez, Juan G.",High-risk infant follow-up;INFANIB test;Neonatal seizures;Neurodevelopment,High-risk infant follow-up;INFANIB test;Neonatal seizures;Neurodevelopment,Colombia;Colombia,

Objectives: To evaluate in non-complicated falciparum malaria patients undergoing treatment with amodiaquine-sulfadoxine-pyrimethamine (AQ-SP), some relationships between treatment response, nutritional status and characteristics of the gen CYP2C8. Methodology: A randomly assigned, balanced, non blind, controlled clinical design. Treatment response was assessed according to WHO 1998 criteria. Analysis included anthropometry, plasma levels of retinol, ferritin and selenium, and assessment of 2C8*1 (wild), 2C8*2 (Il29F) and 2C8*3 variants of CYP2C8 (R139K y K399R). Results: 33 patients were studied, all of them evidenced adequate treatment response, 10% had retinol deficiency, 25% selenium deficiency and 40% low ferritine levels. One patient exhibited the variant Il29F of CYP2C8*2 in a heterozygous fashion, the remaining individuals were homozygous for the wild form of this gene. The mutant R139K of CYP2C8*3 was absent in all individuals. Amplification fragments obtained of K339R (CYP2C8*3 gen) were not suitable for digestion, regardless of the modifications performed. These results confirm previous findings made in 22% of 23 patients in whom some variation was observed ( 5 in CYP2C8*2 and 2 in CYP2C8*3). For CYP2C8*3 the mutant R139K, was observed in 2 individuals. Conclusion: only one of the 33 patients (3%) had CYP2C8*2 in a heterozygous fashion, the remaining were homozygous for the wild allele of this variant. None of the patients had the mutation R139K of the CYP2C8*3 variant.

Methods: Cross-sectional study based on a birth cohort. We used the birth certificate database from January 1 to December 31, 2016. Three multilevel logistic models were constructed. Pregnant women were set at the first level and department at the second level. We fitted a null multilevel model followed by two multiple models, including individual and individual and department variables, respectively. Results: The overall prevalence of C-section was 45.5% (95% CI (45.4-45.6), ranged from 5 to 76%. The variance partition coefficient was 15%. Individual factors did not explain the general contextual effect. However, the region to which these departments belong explained 71% of the variance. The Caribbean region was positively associated with C-section compared to the Andean region (OR:3.88 95% IC (2.65-5.67)). Conclusion: Multilevel analysis of individual heterogeneity and discriminatory accuracy showed that the department plays an important role in the variation of C-sections in Colombia.

This intolerance to exercise has traditionally been attributed to cardiac and respiratory dysfunction. However, as it happens in other chronic diseases, lower-limb and respiratory muscle alterations are also involved in patients with pulmonary hypertension. Increasing evidence suggests that physical exercise training is an efficient and safe strategy. The recommendation for light and moderate-intensity exercise is made within the framework of pulmonary rehabilitation, and its benefits have been previously described. In diseases such as COPD, lower-limb muscle function, exercise tolerance and quality of life improve following exercise training.

This paper addresses this problem, once described the different solutions that have been given throughout history and its drawbacks, it presents what is considered the most appropriate theory to determine causality in each case, to overcome the defects that were blamed on those that preceded them and its acceptance in the comparative field. It reveals how, from the differentiation between imputation and proximate causation, results are more consistent with the concept of justice underlying civic liability.

And we exceptionally deal with competition by imitation, particularly when it is the unique solution to participate in a technological market which requires an imitation on the bottom to allow competitors to be able to develop new and better products that consumers are theoretically willing to demand. In this respect, competition by imitation plays a roll closer to competition by substitution. In the last case, we recognize the importance of the standards in the market than can be used as a tool to achieve exclusionary objectives or that can contribute to the innovation process as a form of essential resources (a manner of essential facility build on intellectual property resource) that allows competition on technologic industries, where innovation and differentiation are the optimal path to achieve market share, stability and economic growth.",Article,"Piedrahita, Carlos Andres Uribe",Competence by imitation and competence by substitution;Competence Law;Cumulative innovation or subsequent innovation;Essential resources;Rejections in hiring,Competence by imitation and competence by substitution;Competence Law;Cumulative innovation or subsequent innovation;Essential resources;Rejections in hiring,Colombia,

While most of the academic discussions are still focused on the tension between ideological positions about the extent of private property rights, this paper will look into some of the policy and institutional challenges faced by the Administration that took office on August 2018.

Specifically, we will focus our study on the classic current, characterized by giving the legal right share a support nature, and by means of an inductive-deductive analysis we come to determine that this nature is not applicable to the legal right share. This is due to the impossibility to fit in the mandatory characteristics and assumptions of support obligations. Thus, legal right share has to be understood as an inheritance institution in nature, consisting of the inheritance, with or without a will, to the spouse or common law spouse, in all inheritance orders.

Although we recognize the importance and usefulness of this type of normative decisions, we must also admit that they can obviate particular aspects that are not incorporated in a general norm, or due to their characteristics, cannot be taken into account when creating the regulatory limit. In this sense, we propose the use of the law’s abuse figure as a relevant remedy for an antisocial exercise of intellectual property rights. For this purpose, we will use property’s social function as a criterion to define cases where abusive use (contrary to law’s purposes) may be identified, as long as property’s social function is understood as a limit to such rights.

In recent years, punitive agendas have won in the competition to affect legal reform. Criminal sanction and crime control measures have been offered in response to the subordination of women and to violence against women within the family. This article assesses some of the consequences of the enactment of crime control measures to face domestic violence. Providing quantitative and qualitative data, I conclude that the effectiveness of the punitive approach to this form of violence is debatable. Although imprisonment for domestic violence has increased, it remains quite low in relation to other offenses. The punitive approach may have also had the unintended result of alienating some victims from the criminal process and discouraging others from cooperating with prosecutors. These mixed results indicate that women's advocates should be cautious about promoting punitive strategies to deal with domestic violence.",Article,"Sanchez-Mejia, Astrid Liliana",Domestic violence;Punitivism;Restorative justice;Women's rights,Domestic violence;Punitivism;Restorative justice;Women's rights,Colombia;United States;United States,

Based on it, an attempt is made to stablish when the Special Jurisdiction for Peace (JEP) can judge businessmen, since the Peace Agreement signed by the Colombian Government and the guerrilla group FARC-EP refers, somehow vaguely, to the “determining participation” of civilians in the crimes, as a standard to decide this point. Taking into consideration some relevant decisions for the development of the international criminal law, this article argues that the concept of complicity offers an appropriate framework for imputation in those cases.

The paper concludes with the idea that the value of the separation of powers and of checks and balances is a Deus ex machine, because the importance of the figure does not come from an abstract design, but from the functional structuring of the elements integrating the state organisation in virtue of which an effective constitutional machinery is put together, reflected in an efficient organisation for the realisation of the State based on the rule of law.",Article,"Donado, Francisco Jose Chaux",Checks and balances;Effectiveness in rights;Political constitution;Separation of powers;State based on the rule of Law,Checks and balances;Effectiveness in rights;Political constitution;Separation of powers;State based on the rule of Law,Colombia,

Law, in modernity, tries to justify a project of violence to avoid divine wrath. Human rights, on the other hand, seem to settle with an interpretation of the message of compassion and charity written in the gospels. The first is an ideological interpretation of the biblical texts, while the second is an interpretation based in greater measure on the questions of the philosophical anthropology on being, the reason for being, and the search for the truth. This article proposes, in light of the questions proposed by Costas Douzinas and René Girard, among others, a reading that suggests an answer which may pose a risk to this contradiction. The risk is that seeing law as an expression of the modern Rule of Law enters into a crisis. The modern processes of expressing violence will notice this. The protagonist behind the curtain revealed in the stage of law is not law itself, but the victim of the sacrifice. This threatens the sustainability of law as a closed and coherent scientific system.",Review,"Gomez-Pinto, Luis Ricardo",Costas Douzinas;Desire;Gospel;Human rights;René Girard;Sacrifice;Secularization;Victim;Violence,Costas Douzinas;Desire;Gospel;Human rights;René Girard;Sacrifice;Secularization;Victim;Violence,Colombia,

Just as the unyielding defense of budgets of the classic private law has generated the problem in question, the uncompromising support of good faith under certain assumptions can forge the conservation of improbable and unjust situations within the contractual process.

Additionally, it is explained why the principle of solidarity should have a more important role because of the covid-19 pandemic/syndemic, and it is expressed the need of not having Insolvency Law as the main tool to be used by Colombian Government to face the new needs brought by the new reality after SARS-CoV-2.",Article,"Wilches Duran, Rafael E.",insolvency;insolvency law;pandemic;solidarity,insolvency;insolvency law;pandemic;solidarity,Colombia,
,,,0,2-s2.0-84961786687,2015,The scope of application of international humanitarian law to non-international armed conflicts,"Since the issuance of the Geneva Conventions in 1949 there has been a latent confusion in States undergoing internal violence situations related to whether or not non-international armed conflicts exist in their national territories, given that neither Article 3, common to the Conventions, nor the Additional Protocol II of 1977, define what a conflict is. Thus, this research document aims to clarify this matter by means of an analysis of the law, case law, and current legal principles, defining what the application margin is for the International Humanitarian Law to non-international armed conflicts. Afterwards, we aim to clarify another common question: Does International Humanitarian Law apply exclusively to Party States, or does it also apply directly to non-state agents? Finally, this document aims to briefly propose a plausible solution to the problem regarding the confusion created by the lack of a clear definition of armed conflict. Said issue clearly harms the protection that during conflicts must be given at all times to hors de combat or protected population.",Review,"Londono-Camargo, Tatiana",Additional protocol II to the Geneva Conventions;Application margin of the international humanitarian law;Application of the IHL to non-state actors;Common article 3;Compliance of the IHL in non-international armed conflicts;Definition of armed conflict;IHL;International humanitarian law;International law of armed conflicts;Law of war;Non-international armed conflict;Non-international conflict existence guidelines;Personal application of the IHL;Security council,Additional protocol II to the Geneva Conventions;Application margin of the international humanitarian law;Application of the IHL to non-state actors;Common article 3;Compliance of the IHL in non-international armed conflicts;Definition of armed conflict;IHL;International humanitarian law;International law of armed conflicts;Law of war;Non-international armed conflict;Non-international conflict existence guidelines;Personal application of the IHL;Security council,Colombia,

These reports are considered one expression of the right of victims' participation before the SJP. In this paper, we first present the regulatory framework about the participation of victims in the SJP and the importance of ensuring this right in the face of the challenges of this jurisdiction. Second, we present a qualitative approach of data gathered from semi-structured interviews conducted with representatives of organizations that have submitted reports to the SJP. These interviews aimed to explore the right of submitting reports to the SJP regarding three concepts: support, visibility and participation. Results showed that (1) victims receive support to submit their reports, (2) the submission of the reports increase victims' visibility, and (3) the submission of the reports are considered an actual victims' participation mechanism.",Article,"Duenas, Lorena Cecilia Vega",Participation;Reports;Special Jurisdiction for Peace;Victims,Participation;Reports;Special Jurisdiction for Peace;Victims,Colombia,

When international litigation and criminal defense are confused : Comments on the Case of Massacre of Santo Domingo v. Colombia","The Inter-American Human Rights system continues to be o ne full of surprises. On the one hand, there are State official agencies that see no distinction between the system itself and any defense in a typical criminal case, and on the other hand, there is an Inter-American Court that only exceptionally rescues the judicial internal system of the States. That was exactly what occurred in the Massacre of Santo Domingo v. Colombia case involving a tragic event where 17 civilians were killed and 27 were injured while a violent fight took place between the Colombian military and the FARC. The first part of this manuscript will feature the inconsistencies of the State -the only entity with standing before the Court- which resorted to a defense that assailed its own Judicial Branch by both denouncing an alleged fraud on the part of the Prosecutor's Office and by dismissing the decisions made by the criminal and administrative judicial instances. Ironically enough, this strategy could well be the total opposite of what an appropriate defense of the troops involved in this tragic event should look like. The second part of this manuscript will feature the form in which the Inter-American Court ended up saving the judicial branch when it labeled the grounds of the State agent (as to the defense presented before the IAHR Commission) as estoppel and when it described such behavior, without hesitation, as contrary to the principles of good faith, equity and legal stability.",Article,"Sanjuan, Rafael A.Prieto",Colombia;Due Process;Estoppel;Human Rights Inter-American Court of Human Rights;International Litigation;Judicial Protection;Redress,Colombia;Due Process;Estoppel;Human Rights Inter-American Court of Human Rights;International Litigation;Judicial Protection;Redress,Colombia,
