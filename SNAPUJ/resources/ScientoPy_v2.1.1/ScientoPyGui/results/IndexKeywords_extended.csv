In the Global Burden of Disease Study 2013 (GBD 2013), we estimated these quantities for acute and chronic diseases and injuries for 188 countries between 1990 and 2013. Methods Estimates were calculated for disease and injury incidence, prevalence, and YLDs using GBD 2010 methods with some important refinements. Results for incidence of acute disorders and prevalence of chronic disorders are new additions to the analysis. Key improvements include expansion to the cause and sequelae list, updated systematic reviews, use of detailed injury codes, improvements to the Bayesian meta-regression method (DisMod-MR), and use of severity splits for various causes. An index of data representativeness, showing data availability, was calculated for each cause and impairment during three periods globally and at the country level for 2013. In total, 35 620 distinct sources of data were used and documented to calculated estimates for 301 diseases and injuries and 2337 sequelae. The comorbidity simulation provides estimates for the number of sequelae, concurrently, by individuals by country, year, age, and sex. Disability weights were updated with the addition of new population-based survey data from four countries. Findings Disease and injury were highly prevalent; only a small fraction of individuals had no sequelae. Comorbidity rose substantially with age and in absolute terms from 1990 to 2013. Incidence of acute sequelae were predominantly infectious diseases and short-term injuries, with over 2 billion cases of upper respiratory infections and diarrhoeal disease episodes in 2013, with the notable exception of tooth pain due to permanent caries with more than 200 million incident cases in 2013. Conversely, leading chronic sequelae were largely attributable to non-communicable diseases, with prevalence estimates for asymptomatic permanent caries and tension-type headache of 2.4 billion and 1.6 billion, respectively. The distribution of the number of sequelae in populations varied widely across regions, with an expected relation between age and disease prevalence. YLDs for both sexes increased from 537.6 million in 1990 to 764.8 million in 2013 due to population growth and ageing, whereas the age-standardised rate decreased little from 114.87 per 1000 people to 110.31 per 1000 people between 1990 and 2013. Leading causes of YLDs included low back pain and major depressive disorder among the top ten causes of YLDs in every country. YLD rates per person, by major cause groups, indicated the main drivers of increases were due to musculoskeletal, mental, and substance use disorders, neurological disorders, and chronic respiratory diseases; however HIV/AIDS was a notable driver of increasing YLDs in sub-Saharan Africa. Also, the proportion of disability-adjusted life years due to YLDs increased globally from 21.1% in 1990 to 31.2% in 2013. Interpretation Ageing of the world's population is leading to a substantial increase in the numbers of individuals with sequelae of diseases and injuries. Rates of YLDs are declining much more slowly than mortality rates. The non-fatal dimensions of disease and injury will require more and more attention from health systems. The transition to non-fatal outcomes as the dominant source of burden of disease is occurring rapidly outside of sub-Saharan Africa. Our results can guide future health initiatives through examination of epidemiological trends and a better understanding of variation across countries.",Article,"Vos, T.; Barber, R.M.; Bell, B.; Bertozzi-Villa, A.;

To identify new susceptibility loci, we performed a meta-analysis of 11 GWAS, comprising 15,748 breast cancer cases and 18,084 controls together with 46,785 cases and 42,892 controls from 41 studies genotyped on a 211,155-marker custom array (iCOGS). Analyses were restricted to women of European ancestry. We generated genotypes for more than 11 million SNPs by imputation using the 1000 Genomes Project reference panel, and we identified 15 new loci associated with breast cancer at P < 5 x 10(-8). Combining association analysis with ChIP-seq chromatin binding data in mammary cell lines and ChIA-PET chromatin interaction data from ENCODE, we identified likely target genes in two regions: SETBP1 at 18q12.3 and RNF115 and PDZK1 at 1q21.1.

RESEARCH DESIGN AND METHODS - Logistic regression analysis was used to identify factors for achieving A1C <7% in 11,799 patients (1,898 type 1 diabetic and 9,901 type 2 diabetic) recruited by 937 physicians from 1.7 countries in Eastern Europe (n = 3,519), Asia (n = 5,888), Latin America (n = 2,116), and Africa (n = 276). RESULTS - Twenty-two percent of type 1 diabetic and 36% of type 2 diabetic patients never had A1C measurements. in those with values for A1C, blood pressure, and LDL cholesterol, 7.5% of type 1 diabetic (n = 696) and 3.6% of type 2 diabetic (n = 3,896) patients attained all three recommended targets (blood pressure <130/80 mmHg, LDL cholesterol <100 mg/dl, and A1C <7%). Self-monitoring of blood glucose was the only predictor for achieving the A1C goal in type 1 diabetes (odds ratios: Asia 2.24, Latin America 3.55, and Eastern Europe 2.42). In type 2 diabetes, short disease duration (Asia 0.97, Latin America 0.97, and Eastern Europe 0.82) and treatment With few oral glucose-lowering drugs (Asia 0,64, Latin America 0.76, and Eastern Europe 0,62) were predictors, Other region-specific factors included lack of microvascular complications and old age in Latin America and Asia; health insurance coverage and specialist care in Latin America; lack of obesity and self-adjustment of insulin dosages in Asia; and training by a diabetes educator, self-monitoring of blood glucose in Patients who self-adjusted insulin, and lack of macrovascular complications in Eastern Europe.

Preterm infants have low vitamin A status at birth and this has been associated with an increased risk of developing chronic lung disease. Objectives To evaluate supplementation with vitamin A on the incidence of death or neonatal chronic lung disease and long-term neurodevelopmental disability in very low birth weight (VLBW) infants compared with a control (placebo or no supplementation), and to consider the effect of the supplementation route, dose, and timing. Search methods For the original review and subsequent updates, we searched the Cochrane Central Register of Controlled Trials (CENTRAL, The Cochrane Library), MEDLINE, Science Citation Index, and the Oxford Database of Perinatal Trials. The reference lists of relevant trials, paediatric and nutrition journals, and conference abstracts and proceedings were handsearched up to 2010. For the 2016 update, we used the standard search strategy of the Cochrane Neonatal Review group to search the Cochrane Central Register of Controlled Trials (CENTRAL 2016, Issue 4), MEDLINE via PubMed (1 May 2016), EMBASE (1 May 2016), and CINAHL (1 May 2016). We also searched clinical trials' databases, conference proceedings, and the reference lists of retrieved articles for randomised controlled trials and quasi-randomised trials. Selection criteria Randomised controlled trials comparing vitamin A supplementation with a control (placebo or no supplementation) or other dosage regimens in VLBW infants (birth weight <= 1500 grams or less than 32 weeks' gestation). Data collection and analysis Two review authors screened the search results, extracted data, and assessed the trials for risk of bias. Results were reported as risk ratios (RR), risk differences (RD), and number needed to treat to benefit (NNTB), all with 95% confidence intervals (CI). Trialists were contacted for additional data. Main results Eleven trials met the inclusion criteria. Ten trials (1460 infants) compared vitamin A supplementation with a control and one (120 infants) compared different regimens of vitamin A supplementation. Compared to the control group, vitamin A appeared to have a small benefit in reducing the risk of death or oxygen requirement at onemonth of age (typical RR 0.93, 95% CI 0.88 to 0.99; typical RD -0.05, 95% CI -0.10 to -0.01; NNTB 20, 95% CI 10 to 100; 6 studies, 1165 infants) and the risk of chronic lung disease (oxygen requirement) at 36 weeks' postmenstrual age (typical RR 0.87, 95% CI 0.77 to 0.99; typical RD -0.07, 95% CI -0.13 to -0.01; NNTB 11, 95% CI 6 to 100; 5 studies, 986 infants) (moderate-quality evidence). There was a marginal reduction of the combined outcome of death or chronic lung disease (typical RR 0.92, 95% CI 0.84 to 1.01; typical RD -0.05, 95% CI -0.11 to 0.01; 4 studies, 1089 infants). Neurodevelopmental assessment of 88% of the surviving infants in the largest trial showed no difference between the groups at 18 to 22 months of age, corrected for prematurity (low-quality evidence). There is no evidence to support different vitamin A dosing regimens. No adverse effects of vitamin A supplementation were reported, but it was noted that intramuscular injections of vitamin A were painful. Authors' conclusions Whether clinicians decide to utilise repeat intramuscular doses of vitamin A to prevent chronic lung disease may depend upon the local incidence of this outcome and the value attached to achieving a modest reduction in the outcome balanced against the lack of other proven benefits and the acceptability of the treatment. Information on long-term neurodevelopmental status suggests no evidence of either benefit or harm from the intervention.",Review,"Darlow, B.A.; Graham, P.J.; Rojas-Reyes, M.X.","Infant, Very Low Birth Weight; Infant, Premature; Infant, Premature; Diseases [mortality; prevention & control];; Lung Diseases [mortality; prevention & control]; Randomized Controlled Trials as Topic; Vitamin A [therapeutic use]; Vitamins [therapeutic use]; Humans; Infant, Newborn","Infant, Very Low Birth Weight;Infant, Premature;Diseases [mortality;prevention & control];Lung Diseases [mortality;Randomized Controlled Trials as Topic;Vitamin A [therapeutic use];Vitamins [therapeutic use];Humans;Infant, Newborn;RANDOMIZED CONTROLLED-TRIAL;BRONCHOPULMONARY DYSPLASIA;PRETERM INFANTS;RISK",New Zealand;Colombia,2-s2.0-84983294318

Since nothing is known about the contribution of BRCA1 and BRCA2 germline mutations to hereditary breast/ovarian cancer in the Hispanic population from Colombia, we conducted the first study of 53 breast/ovarian cancer families from this country. Comprehensive BRCA mutation screening was performed using a range of techniques, including DHPLC, SSCP, and PTT, followed by DNA sequencing analysis. Thirteen deleterious germline mutations (24.5%) were identified in 53 families, comprising eight in BRCA1 and five in BRCA2. The two recurrent BRCA1 mutations, 3450 delCAAG and A1708E, accounted for 100% of all BRCA1 mutations identified in this cohort and the recurrent 3034 delACAA BRCA2 mutation for 40% of all BRCA2 mutations. Haplotype analyses suggested that each of these mutations has arisen from a common ancestor. The prevalence of BRCA1 or BRCA2 mutations was 50% in multiple case breast cancer families, and was 33% for the breast-ovarian cancer families. Our findings show that BRCA mutations account for a substantial proportion of hereditary breast/ovarian cancer in Colombia. The spectrum of mutations differed completely to that previously reported in Hispanic families of predominantly Mexican origin from Southern California [1] suggesting that specific genetic risk assessment strategies for the different Hispanic populations in South America and in the United States need to be developed.",Article,"Torres, D.; Rashid, M.U.; Gil, F.; Umana, A.; Ramelli, G.; Robledo, J.F.; Tawil, M.; Torregrosa, L.; Briceno, I.; Hamann, U.",BRCA1/2; germline mutations; hereditary breast; ovarian cancer; Hispanics; Colombia,BRCA1/2;germline mutations;hereditary breast;ovarian cancer;Hispanics;Colombia;BREAST-CANCER;OVARIAN-CANCER;GENETIC-HETEROGENEITY;PHENOTYPE ANALYSIS;RISK;FREQUENCY;PENETRANCE;PREVALENCE,Germany;Colombia;Pakistan,2-s2.0-34249040579

Breast cancer susceptibility variants frequently show heterogeneity in associations by tumor subtype(1-3). To identify novel loci, we performed a genome-wide association study including 133,384 breast cancer cases and 113,789 controls, plus 18,908 BRCA1 mutation carriers (9,414 with breast cancer) of European ancestry, using both standard and novel methodologies that account for underlying tumor heterogeneity by estrogen receptor, progesterone receptor and human epidermal growth factor receptor 2 status and tumor grade. We identified 32 novel susceptibility loci (P < 5.0 x 10(-8)), 15 of which showed evidence for associations with at least one tumor feature (false discovery rate < 0.05). Five loci showed associations (P < 0.05) in opposite directions between luminal and non-luminal subtypes. In silico analyses showed that these five loci contained cell-specific enhancers that differed between normal luminal and basal mammary cells. The genetic correlations between five intrinsic-like subtypes ranged from 0.35 to 0.80. The proportion of genome-wide chip heritability explained by all known susceptibility loci was 54.2% for luminal A-like disease and 37.6% for triple-negative disease. The odds ratios of polygenic risk scores, which included 330 variants, for the highest 1% of quantiles compared with middle quantiles were 5.63 and 3.02 for luminal A-like and triple-negative disease, respectively. These findings provide an improved understanding of genetic predisposition to breast cancer subtypes and will inform the development of subtype-specific polygenic risk scores.",Article,"Zhan, H.Y.; Ahearn, T.U.; Lecarpentier, J.; Barnes, D.; Beesley, J.; Qi, G.H.; Jiang, X.; O'Mara, T.A.; Zhao, N.; Bolla, M.K.; Dunning, A.M.; Dennis, J.; Wang, Q.; Abu Ful, Z.; Aittomaki, K.; Andrulis, I.L.; Anton-Culver, H.; Arndt, V.; Aronson, K.J.; Arun, B.K.; Auer, P.L.; Azzollini, J.; Barrowdale, D.; Becher, H.; Beckmann, M.W.; Behrens, S.; Benitez, J.; Bermisheva, M.; Bialkowska, K.; Blanco, A.; Blomqvist, C.; Bogdanova, N.V.; Bojesen, S.E.; Bonanni, B.; Bondavalli, D.; Borg, A.; Brauch, H.; Brenner, H.; Briceno, I.; Broeks, A.; Brucker, S.Y.; Bruning, T.; Burwinkel, B.; Buys, S.S.; Byers, H.; Caldes, T.; Caligo, M.A.; Calvello, M.; Campa, D.; Castelao, J.E.; Chang-Claude, J.; Chanock, S.J.; Christiaens, M.; Christiansen, H.; Chung, W.K.; Claes, K.B.M.; Clarke, C.L.; Cornelissen, S.; Couch, F.J.; Cox, A.; Cross, S.S.; Czene, K.; Daly, M.B.; Devilee, P.; Diez, O.; Domchek, S.M.; Dork, T.; Dwek, M.; Eccles, D.M.; Ekici, A.B.; Evans, D.G.; Fasching, P.A.; Figueroa, J.; Foretova, L.; Fostira, F.; Friedman, E.; Frost, D.; Gago-Dominguez, M.; Gapstur, S.M.; Garber, J.; Garcia-Saenz, J.A.; Gaudet, M.M.; Gayther, S.A.; Giles, G.G.; Godwin, A.K.; Goldberg, M.S.; Goldgar, D.E.; Gonzalez-Neira, A.; Greene, M.H.; Gronwald, J.; Guenel, P.; Haberle, L.; Hahnen, E.; Haiman, C.A.; Hake, C.R.; Hall, P.; Hamann, U.; Harkness, E.F.; Heemskerk-Gerritsen, B.A.M.; Hillemanns, P.; Hogervorst, F.B.L.; Holleczek, B.; Hollestelle, A.; Hooning, M.J.; Hoover, R.N.; Hopper, J.L.; Howell, A.; Huebner, H.; Hulick, P.J.; Imyanitov, E.N.; Isaacs, C.; Izatt, L.; Jager, A.; Jakimovska, M.; Jakubowska, A.; James, P.; Janavicius, R.; Janni, W.; John, E.M.; Jones, M.E.; Jung, A.; Kaaks, R.; Kapoor, P.M.; Karlan, B.Y.; Keeman, R.; Khan, S.; Khusnutdinova, E.; Kitahara, C.M.; Ko, Y.D.; Konstantopoulou, I.; Koppert, L.B.; Koutros, S.; Kristensen, V.N.; Laenkholm, A.V.; Lambrechts, D.; Larsson, S.C.; Laurent-Puig, P.; Lazaro, C.; Lazarova, E.; Lejbkowicz, F.; Leslie, G.; Lesueur, F.; Lindblom, A.; Lissowska, J.; Lo, W.Y.; Loud, J.T.; Lubinski, J.; Lukomska, A.; MacInnis, R.J.; Mannermaa, A.; Manoochehri, M.; Manoukian, S.; Margolin, S.; Martinez, M.E.; Matricardi, L.; McGuffog, L.; McLean, C.; Mebirouk, N.; Meindl, A.; Menon, U.; Miller, A.; Mingazheva, E.; Montagna, M.; Mulligan, A.M.; Mulot, C.; Muranen, T.A.; Nathanson, K.L.; Neuhausen, S.L.; Nevanlinna, H.; Neven, P.; Newman, W.G.; Nielsens, F.C.; Nikitina-Zake, L.; Nodora, J.; Offit, K.; Olah, E.; Olopade, O.I.; Olsson, H.; Orr, N.; Papi, L.; Papp, J.; Park-Simon, T.W.; Parsons, M.T.; Peissel, B.; Peixoto, A.; Peshkin, B.; Peterlongo, P.; Peto, J.; Phillips, K.A.; Piedmonte, M.; Plaseska-Karanfilska, D.; Prajzendanc, K.; Prentice, R.; Prokofyeva, D.; Rack, B.; Radice, P.; Ramus, S.J.; Rantala, J.; Rashid, M.U.; Rennert, G.; Rennert, H.S.; Risch, H.A.; Romero, A.; Rookus, M.A.; Rubner, M.; Rudiger, T.; Saloustros, E.; Sampson, S.; Sandler, D.P.; Sawyer, E.J.; Scheuner, M.T.; Schmutzler, R.K.; Schneeweiss, A.; Schoemaker, M.J.; Schottker, B.; Schurmann, P.; Senter, L.; Sharma, P.; Sherman, M.E.; Shu, X.O.; Singer, C.F.; Smichkoska, S.; Soucy, P.; Southey, M.C.; Spinelli, J.J.; Stone, J.; Stoppa-Lyonnet, D.; Swerdlow, A.J.; Szabo, C.I.; Tamimi, R.M.; Tapper, W.J.; Taylor, J.A.; Teixeira, M.R.; Terry, M.; Thomassen, M.; Thull, D.L.; Tischkowitz, M.; Toland, A.E.; Tollenaar, R.A.E.M.; Tomlinson, I.; Torres, D.; Troester, M.A.; Truong, T.; Tung, N.; Untch, M.; Vachon, C.M.; van den Ouweland, A.M.W.; van der Kolk, L.E.; van Veen, E.M.; vanRensburg, E.J.; Vega, A.; Wappenschmidt, B.; Weinberg, C.R.; Weitzel, J.N.; Wildiers, H.; Winqvist, R.; Wolk, A.; Yang, X.H.R.; Yannoukakos, D.; Zheng, W.; Zorn, K.K.; Milne, R.L.; Kraft, P.; Simard, J.; Pharoah, P.D.P.; Michailidou, K.; Antoniou, A.C.; Schmidt, M.K.; Chenevix-Trench, G.; Easton, D.F.; Chatterjee, N.; Garcia-Closas, M.",,MUTATION CARRIERS;RISK;HERITABILITY;METAANALYSIS;MODIFIERS;BRCA1,United States;United Kingdom;Australia;Israel;Finland;Canada;Germany;Italy;Spain;Russian Federation;Poland;Sweden;BELARUS;Denmark;Colombia;Netherlands;Belgium;Czech Republic;Greece;Malaysia;France;North Macedonia;Lithuania;Norway;Latvia;Hungary;North Ireland;Portugal;Pakistan;Austria;South Africa;Cyprus,

Histopathological features thus have utility for mutation prediction, including statistical modeling to assess pathogenicity of BRCA1 or BRCA2 variants of uncertain clinical significance. We analyzed large pathology datasets accrued by the Consortium of Investigators of Modifiers of BRCA1/2 (CIMBA) and the Breast Cancer Association Consortium (BCAC) to reassess histopathological predictors of BRCA1 and BRCA2 mutation status, and provide robust likelihood ratio (LR) estimates for statistical modeling. Methods: Selection criteria for study/center inclusion were estrogen receptor (ER) status or grade data available for invasive breast cancer diagnosed younger than 70 years. The dataset included 4,477 BRCA1 mutation carriers, 2,565 BRCA2 mutation carriers, and 47,565 BCAC breast cancer cases. Country-stratified estimates of the likelihood of mutation status by histopathological markers were derived using a Mantel-Haenszel approach. Results: ER-positive phenotype negatively predicted BRCA1 mutation status, irrespective of grade (LRs from 0.08 to 0.90). ER-negative grade 3 histopathology was more predictive of positive BRCA1 mutation status in women 50 years or older (LR = 4.13 (3.70 to 4.62)) versus younger than 50 years (LR = 3.16 (2.96 to 3.37)). For BRCA2, ER-positive grade 3 phenotype modestly predicted positive mutation status irrespective of age (LR = 1.7-fold), whereas ER-negative grade 3 features modestly predicted positive mutation status at 50 years or older (LR = 1.54 (1.27 to 1.88)). Triple-negative tumor status was highly predictive of BRCA1 mutation status for women younger than 50 years (LR = 3.73 (3.43 to 4.05)) and 50 years or older (LR = 4.41 (3.86 to 5.04)), and modestly predictive of positive BRCA2 mutation status in women 50 years or older (LR = 1.79 (1.42 to 2.24)). Conclusions: These results refine likelihood-ratio estimates for predicting BRCA1 and BRCA2 mutation status by using commonly measured histopathological features. Age at diagnosis is an important variable for most analyses, and grade is more informative than ER status for BRCA2 mutation carrier prediction. The estimates will improve BRCA1 and BRCA2 variant classification and inform patient mutation testing and clinical management.",Article,"Spurdle, A.B.; Couch, F.J.; Parsons, M.T.; McGuffog, L.; Barrowdale, D.; Bolla, M.K.; Wang, Q.; Healey, S.; Schmutzler, R.K.; Wappenschmidt, B.; Rhiem, K.; Hahnen, E.; Engel, C.; Meindl, A.; Ditsch, N.; Arnold, N.; Plendl, H.; Niederacher, D.; Sutter, C.; Wang-Gohrke, S.; Steinemann, D.; Preisler-Adams, S.; Kast, K.; Varon-Mateeva, R.; Ellis, S.; Frost, D.; Platte, R.; Perkins, J.; Evans, D.G.; Izatt, L.; Eeles, R.; Adlard, J.; Davidson, R.; Cole, T.; Scuvera, G.; Manoukian, S.; Bonanni, B.; Mariette, F.; Fortuzzi, S.; Viel, A.; Pasini, B.; Papi, L.; Varesco, L.; Balleine, R.; Nathanson, K.L.; Domchek, S.M.; Offitt, K.; Jakubowska, A.; Lindor, N.; Thomassen, M.; Jensen, U.B.; Rantala, J.; Borg, A.; Andrulis, I.L.; Miron, A.; Hansen, T.V.O.; Caldes, T.; Neuhausen, S.L.; Toland, A.E.; Nevanlinna, H.; Montagna, M.; Garber, J.; Godwin, A.K.; Osorio, A.; Factor, R.E.; Terry, M.B.; Rebbeck, T.R.; Karlan, B.Y.; Southey, M.; Rashid, M.U.; Tung, N.; Pharoah, P.D.P.; Blows, F.M.; Dunning, A.M.; Provenzano, E.; Hall, P.; Czene, K.; Schmidt, M.K.; Broeks, A.; Cornelissen, S.; Verhoef, S.; Fasching, P.A.; Beckmann, M.W.; Ekici, A.B.; Slamon, D.J.; Bojesen, S.E.; Nordestgaard, B.G.; Nielsen, S.F.; Flyger, H.; Chang-Claude, J.; Flesch-Janys, D.; Rudolph, A.; Seibold, P.; Aittomaki, K.; Muranen, T.A.; Heikkila, P.; Blomqvist, C.; Figueroa, J.; Chanock, S.J.; Brinton, L.; Lissowska, J.; Olson, J.E.; Pankratz, V.S.; John, E.M.; Whittemore, A.S.; West, D.W.; Hamann, U.; Torres, D.; Ulmer, H.U.; Rudiger, T.; Devilee, P.; Tollenaar, R.A.E.M.; Seynaeve, C.; Van Asperen, C.J.; Eccles, D.M.; Tapper, W.J.; Durcan, L.; Jones, L.; Peto, J.; dos-Santos-Silva, I.; Fletcher, O.; Johnson, N.; Dwek, M.; Swann, R.; Bane, A.L.; Glendon, G.; Mulligan, A.M.; Giles, G.G.; Milne, R.L.; Baglietto, L.; McLean, C.; Carpenter, J.; Clarke, C.; Scott, R.; Brauch, H.; Bruning, T.; Ko, Y.D.; Cox, A.; Cross, S.S.; Reed, M.W.R.; Lubinski, J.; Jaworska-Bieniek, K.; Durda, K.; Gronwald, J.; Dork, T.; Bogdanova, N.; Park-Simon, T.W.; Hillemanns, P.; Haiman, C.A.; Henderson, B.E.; Schumacher, F.; Le Marchand, L.; Burwinkel, B.; Marme, F.; Surovy, H.; Yang, R.; Anton-Culver, H.; Ziogas, A.; Hooning, M.J.; Collee, J.M.; Martens, J.W.M.; Tilanus-Linthorst, M.M.A.; Brenner, H.; Dieffenbach, A.K.; Arndt, V.; Stegmaier, C.; Winqvist, R.; Pylkas, K.; Jukkola-Vuorinen, A.; Grip, M.; Lindblom, A.; Margolin, S.; Joseph, V.; Robson, M.; Rau-Murthy, R.; Gonzalez-Neira, A.; Arias, J.I.; Zamora, P.; Benitez, J.; Mannermaa, A.; Kataja, V.; Kosma, V.M.; Hartikainen, J.M.; Peterlongo, P.; Zaffaroni, D.; Barile, M.; Capra, F.; Radice, P.; Teo, S.H.; Easton, D.F.; Antoniou, A.C.; Chenevix-Trench, G.; Goldgar, D.E.",,DNA-SEQUENCE VARIANTS;ESTROGEN-RECEPTOR;GERMLINE MUTATIONS;CLINICAL-SIGNIFICANCE;OVARIAN CANCERS;TUMOR PATHOLOGY;BASAL PHENOTYPE;FAMILY-HISTORY;RISK;FEATURES,Australia;United States;United Kingdom;Germany;Italy;Poland;Denmark;Sweden;Canada;Spain;Finland;Pakistan;Netherlands;Colombia;Malaysia,2-s2.0-84928752028

In this study, we evaluated the ability of the world's PAs to represent extant amphibian species. We also estimated the magnitude of the human footprint along the geographic distributions of gap species (i.e., those with distributions totally outside PAs). Twenty-four percent of species (n = 1535) are totally unrepresented, and another 18% (n = 1119) have less than 5% of their distribution inside PM. Nearly half of all species with ranges under 1000 km(2) do not occur inside any PA Furthermore, more than 65% of the distribution of gap species is in human-dominated landscapes. Although the Earth's PM have greatly increased during the last ten years, the number of unprotected amphibians has also grown. Tropical countries in particular should strongly consider (1) the importance of using amphibians to drive conservation policies that eventually lead to the implementation and management of PM, given amphibians' extinction risk and ability to act as bioindicators; (2) the effectiveness of national recovery plans for threatened amphibian species; and (3) the-need for increased funding for scientific research to expand our knowledge of amphibian species. Meanwhile, data-deficient amphibian species should receive a higher priority than they usually receive in conservation planning, as a precautionary measure. Throughout this paper, we point out several challenges in creating more comprehensive amphibian conservation strategies and opportunities in the next decade. (C) 2015 Elsevier Ltd.

Methods This cross-sectional observational study was conducted in 452 centres (August 2015-August 2016) in 18 countries in Eastern Europe, Asia, Africa, the Middle East and Latin America. Patients (n=9049) treated for 3 months with any LLT and in whom an LDL-C measurement on stable LLT was available within the previous 12 months were included. Results The meanSD age was 60.2 +/- 11.7 years, 55.0% of patients were men and the mean +/- SD LDL-C value on LLT was 2.6 +/- 1.3mmol/L (101.0 +/- 49.2mg/dL). At enrolment, 97.9% of patients were receiving a statin (25.3% on high intensity treatment). Only 32.1% of the very high risk patients versus 51.9% of the high risk and 55.7% of the moderate risk patients achieved their LDL-C goals. On multivariable analysis, factors independently associated with not achieving LDL-C goals were no (versus lower dose) statin therapy, a higher (versus lower) dose of statin, statin intolerance, overweight and obesity, female sex, neurocognitive disorders, level of cardiovascular risk, LDL-C value unknown at diagnosis, high blood pressure and current smoking. Diabetes was associated with a lower risk of not achieving LDL-C goals.

We evaluated if lung function is worse in patients with inadequate glucose control, and if inflammatory markers are simultaneously increased in these subjects. Methods: Subjects were selected at the Colombian Diabetes Association Center in Bogota. Pulmonary function tests were performed and mean residual values were obtained for forced expiratory volume (FEV1), forced vital capacity (FVC) and FEV1/FVC, with predicted values based on those derived by Hankinson et al. for Mexican-Americans. Multiple least-squares regression was used to adjust for differences in known determinants of lung function. We measured blood levels of glycosylated hemoglobin (HBA(1c)), interleukin 6 (IL-6), tumor necrosis factor (TNF-alpha), fibrinogen, ferritin, and C-reactive protein (C-RP). Results: 495 diabetic patients were studied, out of which 352 had inadequate control (HBA(1c) > 7%). After adjusting for known determinants of lung function, those with inadequate control had lower FEV1 (-75.4 mL, IC95%: -92, -59; P < 0.0001) and FVC (-121 mL, IC95%: -134, -108; P < 0,0001) mean residuals, and higher FEV1/FVC (0.013%, IC95%: 0.009, 0.018, P < 0.0001) residuals than those with adequate control, as well as increased levels of all inflammatory markers (P < 0.05), with the exception of IL-6.

Here, we describe clinical features of sleep disorders in AD and the relation between sleep disorders and both cognitive impairment and poor prognosis of the disease. There are difficulties of the diagnosis of sleep disorders based on sleep questionnaires, polysomnography or actigraphy in the AD patients. Typical disturbances of the neurophysiological sleep architecture in the course of the AD include deep sleep and paradoxical sleep deprivation. Among sleep disorders occurring in patients with AD, the most frequent disorders are sleep breathing disorders and restless legs syndrome. Sleep disorders may influence circadian fluctuations of the concentrations of amyloid-beta in the interstitial brain fluid and in the cerebrovascular fluid related to the glymphatic brain system and production of the amyloid-beta.

A before-after prospective surveillance study to assess the impact of a multidimensional infection control approach for the reduction of catheter-associated urinary tract infection (CAUTI) rates. SETTING. Pediatric intensive care units (PICUs) of hospital members of the International Nosocomial Infection Control Consortium (INICC) from 10 cities of the following 6 developing countries: Colombia, El Salvador, India, Mexico, Philippines, and Turkey. PATIENTS. PICU inpatients. METHODS. We performed a prospective active surveillance to determine rates of CAUTI among 3,877 patients hospitalized in 10 PICUs for a total of 27,345 bed-days. The study was divided into a baseline period (phase 1) and an intervention period (phase 2). In phase 1, surveillance was performed without the implementation of the multidimensional approach. In phase 2, we implemented a multidimensional infection control approach that included outcome surveillance, process surveillance, feedback on CAUTI rates, feedback on performance, education, and a bundle of preventive measures. The rates of CAUTI obtained in phase 1 were compared with the rates obtained in phase 2, after interventions were implemented. RESULTS. During the study period, we recorded 8,513 urinary catheter (UC) days, including 1,513 UC-days in phase 1 and 7,000 UCdays in phase 2. In phase 1, the CAUTI rate was 5.9 cases per 1,000 UC-days, and in phase 2, after implementing the multidimensional infection control approach for CAUTI prevention, the rate of CAUTI decreased to 2.6 cases per 1,000 UC-days (relative risk, 0.43 [95% confidence interval, 0.21-1.0]), indicating a rate reduction of 57%. CONCLUSIONS. Our findings demonstrated that implementing a multidimensional infection control approach is associated with a significant reduction in the CAUTI rate of PICUs in developing countries.

Setting: The largest social security hospital in Colombia with a neonatal intensive care unit. Subjects: At 12 months of corrected age, 194 families in the Kangaroo Mother Care group and 144 families in the Traditional Care group were available for analysis. Interventions: Infants were kept 24 h/day in an upright position, in skin-to-skin contact until it was no longer tolerated by the infants. Babies in the Traditional Care were kept in incubators on the Minimal Care Unit until they satisfied the usual discharge criteria. Outcome measures: The Home Observation for Measurement of the Environment (HOME), Father Involvement and Developmental Quotient (Griffiths) scores. Results: 1) Kangaroo mothers created a more stimulating context and a better caregiving environment than mothers in the Traditional Care group; 2) this environment was positively correlated to father involvement and 3) the family environment of male infants was most improved by Kangaroo Mother Care. Conclusion: Kangaroo Mother Care has a positive impact on home environment. The results also suggest, first, that both parents should be involved as direct caregivers in the Kangaroo Mother Care procedure and secondly, that this intervention should be directed more specifically at infants who are more at risk at birth.

This systematic review examined the current literature on therapeutic interventions targeting nutrition, physical activity and wellness in BD and collecting health-related measures such as mood and course of illness. Methods: Scopus (all databases), Pubmed and Ovid Medline were systematically searched with no language or year restrictions, up to June 2015, for studies focusing on lifestyle interventions in BD. Search terms were related to bipolar disorder, nutrition, physical activity, wellbeing, psychosocial interventions and course of illness. We hand searched content pages of Bipolar Disorders and Journal of Affective Disorders and checked references of relevant reviews and dissertations to identify additional papers. Results: After applying inclusion and exclusion criteria to identified hits, this literature search retrieved six papers. Overall findings point towards a beneficial role of lifestyle interventions on mood, weight, blood pressure, lipid profile, physical activity and overall wellbeing. Methodological limitations include small sample size, gender ratio imbalance, inconsistencies in terms of laboratory measures, and lack of randomized controlled trials and absence of follow-up and longitudinal studies to determine the benefits of these factors on clinical and functional outcomes over time Conclusions: Lifestyle interventions in BD targeting nutrition, exercise, wellbeing alongside beliefs, coping strategies and attitudes towards health show promise in reducing the risk of comorbid ailments in BD. There is still a strong need for studies a) developing interventions which are informed by the patient's input and b) examining the effectiveness of such interventions targeting general wellness using well-controlled trials.

It also documents sociopolitical barriers and facilitators involved in urban interventions linked with active living in the ten most populated urban settings of Latin America. The synthesis of evidence indicates that several attributes of urban environments are associated with physical activity, including land-use mix and cycling infrastructure. The documentary analysis indicated that despite the benefits and opportunities provided by the programs and existing infrastructure in the examined cities, an overall concern is the rising inequality in the coverage and distribution of the initiatives in the region. If these programs and initiatives are to achieve a real population level effect that helps to reduce health disparities, they need to examine their social and spatial distribution within the cities so they can reach underserved populations and develop to their full potential.

In light of the advances in the reprocessing of goods to improve financial performance, the analysis of a closed-loop supply chain becomes crucial for the competitiveness of companies. We propose a multi-period model to solve the supply chain design problem in which several items must be produced through different levels after the production process, considering the flow of reverse of some products, which can be reprocessed or discarded. In this paper, we studied the design of a supply chain that includes several plants, distribution centers, collection centers, demand zones, and products; it consists of both products forward and reverses in the supply chain. Indeed, the perturbation parameters, robustness requirements, and the performance characteristics were identified qualitatively and quantitatively by determining their impact on the formulation and methodology. A variety of configurations are produced in the closed-loop supply chain, considering the variations of the uncertainty of the demand as a perturbation parameter. The objective is to maximize the economic value-added (EVA (TM)); therefore, the most robust configuration is identified through robustness- EVA (TM) characterization and used to design the closed-loop chain. Finally, we present a numerical example using real information of the electronics industry in Bogota to test the applied methodology and show that it is suitable for this type of problems.

Differences in telomere length (TL) have been reported as possible risk factors for several neuropsychiatric disorders, including PD. Results from published studies for TL in PD are inconsistent, highlighting the need for a meta-analysis. In the current work, a meta-analysis of published studies for TL in PD was carried out. PubMed, Web of Science and Google Scholar databases were used to identify relevant articles that reported TL in groups of PD patients and controls. A random-effects model was used for meta-analytical procedures. The meta-analysis included eight primary studies, derived from populations of European and Asian descent, and did not show a significant difference in TL between 956 PD patients and 1284 controls (p value: 0.246). Our results show that there is no consistent evidence of shorter telomeres in PD patients and suggest the importance of future studies on TL and PD that analyze other populations and also include assessment of TL from different brain regions.

At least three randomized clinical trials (Diabetes Control and Complications Trial in type 1 diabetes, United Kingdom Prospective Diabetes Study and Steno-2 in type 2 diabetes) have demonstrated that patients treated intensively for a period of time have a lower risk of micro- and macrovascular complications that persists during subsequent follow-up, even after their tight control has relented and the levels of glycated hemoglobin in the conventionally treated group improve. The mechanisms are not fully understood but most probably relate to the physiopathology of vascular complications of diabetes, and in recent years a unifying theory has been emerging to understand them. The excess superoxide anion produced by the mitochondria in response to hyperglycemia leads through disturbances at the nuclear level to the accumulation of potentially harmful substances such as advanced glycated end-products, protein kinase C, and nuclear factor kappa B, which are directly implicated in the development of vascular complications in diabetes. These adverse effects are not reversed when the high blood glucose is corrected, and some may be permanent because of epigenetic changes. Some antidiabetes drugs and antioxidant substances have produced partial reversibility of the mechanisms involved in the metabolic memory at the experimental level, but probably the best strategy is to optimize the metabolic control as early as possible, even before diabetes is diagnosed.",Article,"Aschner, P.J.; Ruiz, A.J.",,FOLLOW-UP;MULTIFACTORIAL INTERVENTION;OXIDATIVE STRESS;BLOOD-PRESSURE;COMPLICATIONS;PROGRESSION;RETINOPATHY;GLUCOSE;RISK;RATS,Colombia,2-s2.0-84861913103;2-s2.0-84861913103

However, little is known about how effective the TPB is when the behavior under study is embarrassing. To this end, this paper extends the TPB to create a conceptual model to examine the role of anticipated negative emotions on channel intention. An empirical study was conducted whereby the model was tested using survey data on the purchase of Regaine (a hair loss product that is embarrassing to buy) in Boots (a well-known UK multichannel drugstore). The embarrassing nature of Regaine created differences in the importance that emotions played when consumers intend to purchase using face-to-face channels (such as the physical drugstore) as against multichannel options or the internet. The results were analyzed using partial least squares structural equation modelling (PLS-SEM). The effectiveness of the TPB was improved.

Method: Data come from the SABE Bogota study (Health, Well-Being, and Aging), a cross-sectional survey conducted in Bogota, Colombia, in 2012 in community-dwelling adults aged 60 years and older. Using the Mini Nutritional Assessment (MNA), we evaluated the nutritional status and factors associated to malnutrition in this population with regression models. Results: From the 1,573 older adults interviewed, 4.58% were malnourished and 34.27% were at risk of malnourishment. Factors associated to malnourishment were older age (odds ratio [OR] =1.02, 95% confidence interval [CI] = [1.00, 1.04]), perceived poor health (OR = 1.46, 95% CI = [1.13, 1.88]), comorbidities (OR = 1.16, 95% CI = [1.04, 1.30]), and low calf circumference (OR = 2.63, 95% CI = [1.86, 3.72]). Having dentures, perception of being well-nourished, and higher functionality decreased the odds for malnourishment (p < .05).

METHODS: Meta-analyses included summary estimates based on Cox models of twelve datasets using similar to 10.4 million variants for 96,661 women with breast cancer and 7697 events (breast cancer-specific deaths). Oestrogen receptor (ER)-specific analyses were based on 64,171 ER-positive (4116) and 16,172 ER-negative (2125) patients. We evaluated the probability of a signal to be a true positive using the Bayesian false discovery probability (BFDP). RESULTS: We did not find any variant associated with breast cancer-specific mortality at P<5 x 10(-8). For ER-positive disease, the most significantly associated variant was chr7:rs4717568 (BFDP = 7%, P = 1.28 x 10(-7), hazard ratio [HR] = 0.88, 95% confidence interval [ CI] = 0.84-0.92); the closest gene is AUTS2.

CONCLUSIONS: We uncovered germline variants on chromosome 7 at BFDP <15% close to genes for which there is biological evidence related to breast cancer outcome.

Motorcyclists represent more than 380,000 annual deaths worldwide. 28% of the global fatalities in the roads in 2016. With the increase of the accident rate, studies have been developed within the scientific literature. Bibliometric analysis is applied in the field of motorcycle safety in order to identify relevant publications on risk factors of road crashes and their implications. The information in this research was extracted from Web of Science and Scopus databases between 1947 and May 31, 2018. The study identified the key bibliometric indicators such as publications, authors, journals, countries, institutions, citation and co-citation analysis, subject categories, and co-occurrence of terms. EndNote, Microsoft Excel, Statgraphics Centurion and VOS-viewer software were used for the analysis. In total, 1813 articles were considered. The publications from 2000 to 2017 exhibits an average growth of 9%. The journal ""Accident Analysis and Prevention"" was the key issue in the publication and citation. The top institutions were the University of California, Universiti Putra Malaysia, and Monash University. The average citation of the top 10 articles was 134. A network visualization map showed that 'vehicle', 'model', 'system', 'road', 'safety', and 'behavior' were the most commons key terms.

In this regard, it is fundamental to design appropriate models to minimize the social costs of response operations to distribute essential supplies to populations in need. In addition to merely cover logistics cost, social costs include deprivations costs, which are an increasing function of deprivation time, derived from the human suffering caused by the lack of access to a good or a service. This research uses the theory of discrete choices to assess deprivation costs due to the time spent waiting for the delivery of a basket of basic supplies, defined as the changes in the welfare of people affected by disasters. To this end, we designed a stated choice survey, applied to people living in areas affected by floods and earthquakes in Colombia. The estimated models consider the influence of individual's socioeconomic characteristics and random effects on the deprivation cost functions. The functions have a nonlinear structure, strictly increasing, and convex on the deprivation time. The results are useful for estimating the social costs of humanitarian relief operations.

,,,27,WOS:000319523000010,2013,Nocturnal phenotypical features of obstructive sleep apnea (OSA) in asthmatic children,"Background Asthma and obstructive sleep apnea (OSA) often coexists during childhood. To delineate this clinical association, we investigated the phenotypical features of OSA in asthmatic children. Specifically, we hypothesized that asthmatic children have a distinct OSA phenotype that involves a higher prevalence of Rapid-Eye-Movement (REM)-related breathing abnormalities relative to children with OSA alone. Methods We conducted a retrospective cross-sectional analysis of 141 children aged 2-12 years with OSA diagnosed by polysomnography (PSG) in our sleep center. Outcomes included PSG parameters, maximal %SaO2 REM desaturations and prevalence of REM-related OSA. Multivariate linear regression model or logistic regression model was built to study the joint effect of asthma and OSA parameters with control for potential confounders (significance level P<0.05). Results Baseline respiratory parameters, obstructive apnea-hypopnea index (OAHI) severity, and oxygenation during NREM sleep were unaffected by the presence of asthma in children with OSA. In contrast, maximal %SaO2 REM desaturation, REM-OAHI and prevalence of REM-related OSA in children with moderate-severe OSA were significantly increased in asthmatic children with OSA compared to subjects with OSA alone. Multivariate analysis revealed that the association between asthma and REM-related OSA parameters is independent of asthma control, BMI, age, and gender. The presence of REM-related OSA in asthmatics was unaffected by rhinitis or atopic status. Conclusion These results demonstrate that asthma is associated with REM-related breathing abnormalities in children with moderate-severe OSA. The link between asthma and REM-related OSA is independent of asthma control and obesity. Further research is needed to delineate the REM-sleep biological mechanisms that modulate the phenotypical expression of OSA in asthmatic children. Pediatr Pulmonol. 2013; 48:592-600.

Primary care physicians in 12 countries were randomly chosen to measure WC and body mass index and record the presence of diabetes and CVD in all consecutive adult patients, consulting them on 2 prespecified half-days. Overall, 70% of 9719 men, and 76% of 18,526 women had AO. Diabetes was reported in 10% of men and 9% of women and CVD in 9% of men and 7% of women. AO was significantly related with diabetes (age-adjusted odds ratio, 1.63 for men and 2.86 for women) and with CVD (odds ratio, 1.41 for men and 1.62 for women). Obesity was also significantly related with diabetes and CVD. Strikingly, abdominal adiposity was very frequent in women with normal body mass index, suggesting that an evidence-based definition of abdominal adiposity in Latin America is needed.",Article,"Aschner, P.; Ruiz, A.; Balkau, B.; Massien, C.; Haffner, S.M.",,WAIST CIRCUMFERENCE;INTERNATIONAL DAY;PRIMARY-CARE;OBESITY;RISK;MELLITUS;MORTALITY;MEN,Colombia;France;United States,2-s2.0-70949089556

Traditionally faecal and total coliforms are use to accomplish such control, and in countries with there is a high incidence of gastrointestinal diseases of parasitic origin, helminth eggs count is done, With improvement in diagnostic methods and the application of epidemiological and microbiological tools, the scenery of sanitary risk has changed introducing new elements for analysis and discussion. Some of these changes are related with the type of microorganisms to be control, the concentration limits to be allowed, the crop type, population exposed and environmental and health circumstances of each country.

Low reliability and validity of the questionnaires has limited the capacity to examine associations between PA and health. The purpose of this study was to compare self-reported and accelerometer-measured PA and SB and their associations with body composition in Latin American countries. Methods Data were obtained from the Latin American Study of Nutrition and Health (aged 15-65 years), collected from September 2014 to February 2015. PA and SB were assessed using the International Physical Activity Questionnaire (long version) and the Actigraph GT3X+ accelerometer. Outcomes of interest included: body mass index (BMI), waist (WC) and neck circumference (NC). We used the Pearson and intraclass correlation coefficient, Bland-Altman plots, and multilevel linear regression models. Results Mean moderate-to-vigorous physical activity (MVPA) by accelerometer and IPAQ were 34.4 min/day (95% CI: 33.4 to 35.4) and 45.6 min/day (95% CI: 43.2 to 48.1), respectively. For SB (accelerometer and IPAQ) the means were 573.1 (95% CI: 568.2 to 577.9) and 231.9 min/day (95% CI: 225.5 to 238.3). MVPA, measured by the accelerometer was negatively associated with BMI (beta = -1.95; 95% CI: -2.83 to -1.08), WC (beta = -5.04; 95% CI: -7.18 to -2.89) and NC (beta = -1.21; 95% CI: -1.79 to -0.63). The MVPA estimated through IPAQ was not significantly associated with any of the three outcome variables. SB, measured by the accelerometer, was positively associated with BMI (beta = 0.26; 95% CI: 0.08 to 0.44) and WC (beta = 0.48; 95% CI: 0.13 to 0.91). SB estimated through IPAQ was positively associated with NC only. Conclusions Low correlation coefficients were observed for accelerometer-derived and IPAQ-reported estimates of PA and SB. Caution is advised when making comparisons between accelerometer-measured and self-reported PA and SB.

,,,25,WOS:000389166900009,2016,Regular sun exposure benefits health,"Since it was discovered that UV radiation was the main environmental cause of skin cancer, primary prevention programs have been started. These programs advise to avoid exposure to sunlight. However, the question arises whether sun-shunning behaviour might have an effect on general health. During the last decades new favourable associations between sunlight and disease have been discovered. There is growing observational and experimental evidence that regular exposure to sunlight contributes to the prevention of colon-, breast-, prostate cancer, non-Hodgkin lymphoma, multiple sclerosis, hypertension and diabetes. Initially, these beneficial effects were ascribed to vitamin D. Recently it became evident that immunomodulation, the formation of nitric oxide, melatonin, serotonin, and the effect of (sun)light on circadian clocks, are involved as well. In Europe (above 50 degrees north latitude), the risk of skin cancer (particularly melanoma) is mainly caused by an intermittent pattern of exposure, while regular exposure confers a relatively low risk. The available data on the negative and positive effects of sun exposure are discussed. Considering these data we hypothesize that regular sun exposure benefits health. (C) 2016 Elsevier Ltd.

This brain region is affected early in individuals with manifest and pre-manifest Huntington's disease (HD). However, the experience of schadenfreude has not yet been investigated in HD. In this study, 21 manifest HD patients, 19 first-degree asymptomatic relatives, and 23 healthy controls performed an experimental task designed to trigger schadenfreude, envy (another social emotion acting as an affective control condition), and control situations.. Both HD patients and first-degree relatives experienced lower schadenfreude in response to others' misfortunes, with no group differences in ratings of envy and control conditions. These results offer unprecedented evidence of a highly specific impairment in reward processing, extending previous reports in manifest and pre-manifest HD individuals. Moreover, these findings suggest that early striatal impairments may be related to reduced feelings of schadenfreude. In sum, our work contributes to the understanding of emotional impairments in early stages of HD, while shedding light on their neural correlates. (C) 2016 Elsevier Ltd.

To evaluate the effectiveness of alcohol-based handrubs (ABH) in reducing acute diarrheal diseases (ADD) and acute respiratory infections (ARI) among children 1-5 years of age in childcare centers with limited tap water. Methods. This was the first cluster-randomized controlled trial in a developing country. The study took place at 42 childcare centers with sporadic and limited water availability in six towns in Colombia. Participants were randomly assigned to use ABH as a complement to handwashing (intervention arm: 21 centers/794 children); or to continue existing handwashing practices (control arm: 21 centers/933 children). ADD and ARI cases were identified through teacher-reported signs and symptoms of illness. Adverse events were monitored. Hazard ratios (HR) were obtained using Cox proportional hazards multivariate regression shared frailty models. Results. Child-days of surveillance totaled 336 038. Loss to follow up was 14.5%. For both ADD and ARI, there were no differences in hazard ratios during the first trimester of the study. In the second and third trimesters, significant reductions in the risk of ADD were found in the intervention compared to control arm (HR = 0.55, P < 0.001 and HR = 0.44, P < 0.001, respectively). There were also significant risk reductions for ARI in the second trimester (HR = 0.80, P < 0.05) and in the third trimester (HR = 0.69, P < 0.001). No adverse events occurred. Conclusions.

These studies are consistently conducted and provide a database for assessment of potential biological risk of carcinogenicity in humans. This report is a systematic review of that database for psychotropic drugs. Method: US Food and Drug Administration-approved registration data ('package inserts') were examined, where available, for all psychotropic drugs in the following classes: antidepressants, antipsychotics, benzodiazepines/sedative-hypnotics, amphetamines and anticonvulsants. Results: Overall, new generation (atypical) antipsychotics (90%, 9/10 agents) and anticonvulsants (85.7%, 6/7 agents) showed the highest evidence of carcinogenicity among psychotropic drugs classes assessed. Antidepressants (63.6%, 7/11) and benzodiazepines/sedative-hypnotics (70%, 7/10) were next, and stimulants (with the exception of methylphenidate) were last (25%, 1/4 agents). Overall, 71.4% of all drugs examined (30/42) showed evidence of carcinogenicity in 43.2% (38/88) of specific experimental studies. Conclusions: US Food and Drug Administration-based analyses demonstrate that almost all atypical antipsychotics and anticonvulsants are carcinogenic in animals, as are the majority of antidepressants and benzodiazepines and methylphenidate.

Methods One hundred fifty eight workers from eight flower manufacturers were assessed. Assessments included Borg self-reported exertion and working practices, medical examinations, video-based observations and kinematic and surface muscular activity assessments of upper-limb. Results Point prevalence of signs and symptoms of CTS, epicondylitis, and De Quervain's disease was 32.9%, 15.2%, and 13.3%, respectively. All tasks are executed on average in wrist extension, ulnar deviation, and high elbow flexion. Average median muscle activity across tasks ranged between 3.6% and 27.3%. Forearm muscles were mainly active. Conclusions The occurrence of signs and symptoms of upper-extremity musculoskeletal disorders was high among the sample. The classification and cutting task showed the highest mechanical demands. Interventions in this working population are required and should be directed to allow for muscular rest on regular basis.

The study area was the Colombian Andean region, comprising 715 rural and urban municipalities. We used 10 years of CL surveillance: 2000-2009. We used spatial-temporal analysis - conditional autoregressive Poisson random effects modelling - in a Bayesian framework to model the dependence of municipality-level incidence on land use, climate, elevation and population density. Bivariable spatial analysis identified rainforests, forests and secondary vegetation, temperature, and annual precipitation as positively associated with CL incidence. By contrast, livestock agroecosystems and temperature seasonality were negatively associated. Multivariable analysis identified land use - rainforests and agro-livestock - and climate - temperature, rainfall and temperature seasonality - as best predictors of CL.

We examined the association between falls and subsequent cognitive decline, and tested the hypothesis that depression would mediate any falls-cognition association among cognitively intact Hispanic Elders. Methods: We used data from the Hispanic Established Population for the Epidemiological Study of the Elderly to examine change in Mini Mental State Examination (MMSE) scores over the 6-year period according to number of falls. All participants (N=1,119) had MMSE scores >= 21 and complete data on Center for Epidemiologic Studies of Depression Scale, social and demographic factors, medical conditions (diabetes, heart attack, stroke, and hypertension), and hand grip muscle strength. Results: At baseline, participants' mean age was 80.8 years (range, 74-109), mean education was 6.3 years (range, 0-17), and mean MMSE was 25.2 (range, 21-30). Of the 1,119 participants, 15.8% experienced one fall and 14.4% had two or more falls. In mixed model analyses, having two or more falls was associated with greater decline in MMSE score (estimate =-0.81, standard error =0.19, P<0.0001) compared to having no fall, after adjusting for age, sex, marital status, and education. The magnitude of the association decreased (estimate =-0.65, standard error=0.19, P=0.0007) when adjustment was made for high depressive symptoms, suggesting a possible mediating effect of depression on the falls-cognition association.

The aim of this study was to investigate the role of RAD51B variants in breast cancer predisposition, particularly in the context of familial breast cancer in Finland. We sequenced the coding region of RAD51B in 168 Finnish breast cancer patients from the Helsinki region for identification of possible recurrent founder mutations. In addition, we studied the known rs999737, rs2588809, and rs1314913 SNPs and RAD51B haplotypes in 44,791 breast cancer cases and 43,583 controls from 40 studies participating in the Breast Cancer Association Consortium (BCAC) that were genotyped on a custom chip (iCOGS). We identified one putatively pathogenic missense mutation c.541C>T among the Finnish cancer patients and subsequently genotyped the mutation in additional breast cancer cases (n = 5259) and population controls (n = 3586) from Finland and Belarus. No significant association with breast cancer risk was seen in the meta-analysis of the Finnish datasets or in the large BCAC dataset. The association with previously identified risk variants rs999737, rs2588809, and rs1314913 was replicated among all breast cancer cases and also among familial cases in the BCAC dataset.

Univariate analysis and odds ratio were calculated within the 95 % confidence intervals and chi(2) test compared the groups. Variables were compared among the clinical periodontal groups and MetS by Wilcoxon and multivariate analysis, and logistic regression was performed for MetS and periodontitis. MetS had higher prevalence in periodontitis group (6.3 %) versus controls (3.2 %). In multivariate analysis, periodontitis was associated with MetS (adjusted OR = 2.72, 95 % CI 1.09-6.79), glucose intolerance with another component of MetS (adjusted OR = 1.78, 1.16 to 2.72), glucose resistance (adjusted OR = 11.46, 95 % CI 1.41-92.88), smoking (OR = 1.72, 95 % CI 1.09-2.71), and city of origin (2.69, 95 % CI 1.79-4.04).

This study examined associations between time spent traveling in motor vehicles per week (TSTMV) and BMI and abdominal obesity (AO) among Colombian adults residing in urban areas who do not own car. Method. Secondary data analysis of the 2005 National Nutrition Survey of Colombia was conducted. TSTMV was assessed using the long International Physical Activity Questionnaire. Body composition was measured in 7900 adults. Polytomous and binary logistic regressions were conducted, stratified by gender and adjusted for confounders, including physical activity (PA). Results. Forty-two percent of participants were either overweight or obese according to their BM!, and 22.4% had AO. Males in the middle (10 to 149 min) and highest (>150 min) TSTMV tertiles were more likely to be overweight (POR = 1.58, 95% CI = 1.13-2.21 and POR = 1.55, 95% CI = 1.12-2.15 respectively, p-trend = 0.012), obese (POR = 2.39, 95% CI = 1.43-3.99 and POR = 1.93, 95% CI = 1.22-3.08 respectively, p trend = 0.019) and to have AO (POR = 1.81, 95% CI = 1.18-2.78 and POR = 1.73, 95% CI = 1.18-2.54 respectively, p-trend = 0.009). Associations were not significant in females. Conclusions. TSTMV was positively associated with overweight and AO in adult Colombian males even after adjusting for PA. These findings highlight the potential deleterious health effects of sedentary behaviors such as prolonged traveling time, independently of having met PA recommendations. (C) 2012 Elsevier Inc.

AbstractPurposeHigh blood pressure is a relevant risk factor for vascular damage, leading to the development of depressive symptoms and dementia in older adults. Moreover, subjective memory complaints are recognized as an early marker of cognitive impairment. However, it has been established that subjective memory complaints could also be a reflection of depressive symptoms. The objective of this paper is to assess the impact of depressive symptoms and subjective memory complaints on the incidence of cognitive impairment in older adults with high blood pressure.MethodsThis is a secondary analysis of the Mexican Health and Aging Study, a representative cohort composed by individuals aged 50years. Participants with cognitive impairment in 2012 were excluded since the outcome was incident cognitive impairment in 2015. Four groups were created according to depressive symptomatology and subjective memory complaints status; analyses were stratified according to blood pressure status. The odds incident cognitive impairment was estimated through logistic regression models.ResultsA total of 6327 participants were included, from which 6.44% developed cognitive impairment. No differences were seen regarding the development of cognitive impairment in participants without high blood pressure. However, increased risk was evident in those with both high blood pressure and depressive symptoms (OR=2.1, 95% CI 1.09-4.09, p=0.026) as with high blood pressure, depressive symptoms and subjective memory complaints (OR=1.91, 9% CI 1.4-3.2, p=0.001).ConclusionIndividuals with depressive symptoms and/or subjective memory complaints have a higher risk of developing incident cognitive impairment when high blood pressure is present.

,,,16,WOS:000373388700001,2016,High expression of ID family and IGJ genes signature as predictor of low induction treatment response and worst survival in adult Hispanic patients with B-acute lymphoblastic leukemia,"Background: B-Acute lymphoblastic leukemia (B-ALL) represents a hematologic malignancy with poor clinical outcome and low survival rates in adult patients. Remission rates in Hispanic population are almost 30 % lower and Overall Survival (OS) nearly two years inferior than those reported in other ethnic groups. Only 61 % of Colombian adult patients with ALL achieve complete remission (CR), median overall survival is 11.3 months and event -free survival (EFS) is 7.34 months. Identification of prognostic factors is crucial for the application of proper treatment strategies and subsequently for successful outcome. Our goal was to identify a gene expression signature that might correlate with response to therapy and evaluate the utility of these as prognostic tool in hispanic patients. Methods: We included 43 adult patients newly diagnosed with B-ALL. We used microarray analysis in order to identify genes that distinguish poor from good response to treatment using differential gene expression analysis. The expression profile was validated by real-time PCR (RT-PCT). Results: We identified 442 differentially expressed genes between responders and non -responders to induction treatment. Hierarchical analysis according to the expression of a 7-gene signature revealed 2 subsets of patients that differed in their clinical characteristics and outcome. Conclusions: Our study suggests that response to induction treatment and clinical outcome of Hispanic patients can be predicted from the onset of the disease and that gene expression profiles can be used to stratify patient risk adequately and accurately.

It has been suggested that self-report should be accompanied by cotinine test. This report evaluates the usefulness of serum cotinine test to assess the association between smoking and periodontal status in a study with a large sample population to be used in studies with other serum markers in epidemiologic and periodontal medicine researches. Material and Methods: 578 patients who were part of a multicenter study on blood biomarkers were evaluated about smoking and its relation to periodontal disease. Severity of periodontal disease was determinate using clinical attachment loss (CAL). Smoking was assessed by a questionnaire and a blood sample drawn for serum cotinine determination. Results: The optimal cut-off point for serum cotinine was 10 ng/ml. Serum cotinine showed greater association with severity of CAL than self-report for mild-moderate CAL [OR 2.03 (CI95% 1.16-3.53) vs. OR 1.08 (CI95% 0.62-1.87)] advanced periodontitis [OR 2.36 (CI95% 1.30-4.31) vs. OR 2.06 (CI95% 0.97-4.38)] and extension of CAL > 3 mm [OR 1.78 (CI95% 1.16-1.71) vs. 1.37 (CI95% 0.89-2.11)]. When the two tests were evaluated together were not shown to be better than serum cotinine test. Conclusions: Self-reported smoking and serum cotinine test >= 10ng/ml are accurate, complementary and more reliable methods to assess the patient's smoking status and could be used in studies evaluating serum samples in large population and multicenter studies. Clinical Relevance: The serum cotinine level is more reliable to make associations with the patient's periodontal status than self-report questionnaire and could be used in multicenter and periodontal medicine studies.",Article,"Duque, A.; Martinez, P.J.; Giraldo, A.; Gualtero, D.F.; Ardila, C.M.; Contreras, A.; Duarte, S.; Lafaurie, G.I.",Biological markers; serum; cotinine; periodontitis; smoking,Biological markers;serum;cotinine;periodontitis;smoking;SELF-REPORTED SMOKING;ENVIRONMENTAL TOBACCO-SMOKE;PASSIVE SMOKING;EXPOSURE;CHROMATOGRAPHY;PREGNANCY;BIOMARKER;MARKERS;LEVEL;RISK,Colombia,2-s2.0-85023609277;2-s2.0-85023609277

Study design: We included all neonates born between January 2004 and August 2007 registered in the ECLAMC database. Maternal prenatal multivitamin use was assessed for 122 newborns with congenital genitourinary tract anomalies and then compared to 271 non-malformed controls. Results: 46,850 births were registered and 122 (26/10,000) of them were identified to have a genitourinary tract anomaly. Prenatal multivitamin supplementation during the first, second, and third trimesters of pregnancy was associated with a reduction in the risk of these anomalies: OR 0.16 (0.08-0.31), OR 0.31 (0.19-0.52), and OR 0.38 (0.23-0.63) respectively. Conclusions: Maternal prenatal multivitamins may reduce the risk of congenital genitourinary tract anomalies, not only during the first 8 weeks of gestation but also later in pregnancy, in developing countries.

Women of childbearing age (WCA) are particularly vulnerable to micronutrient inadequacy. The Minimum Dietary Diversity for Women (MDD-W) has been used widely as a proxy measurement of micronutrient adequacy. This study aimed to assess the association between MDD-W and nutrients adequacy among WCA of eight Latin American countries. Nutrient intakes from 3704 WCA were analyzed with two 24-hour dietary recalls. Dietary diversity was calculated based on ten food groups with a cut-off point of intake >= 5 groups. The mean dietary diversity score was 4.72 points, and 57.7% of WCA achieved MDD-W. Vitamin D and E showed a mean Nutrient Adequacy Ratio (NAR) of 0.03 and 0.38, respectively. WCA with a diverse diet (MDD-W > 5) reported a significantly higher intake of most micronutrients and healthy food groups with less consumption of red and processed meats and sugar-sweetened beverages. MDD-W was significantly associated with the mean adequacy ratio (MAR) of 18 micronutrients evaluated. Nevertheless, even those women with a diverse diet fell short of meeting the Estimated Average Requirements (EAR) for vitamins D and E.

A cross-sectional study was carried out in 2009 among 1,263 women ages 18-59 years living in neighborhoods with low and middle-low socioeconomic status in the urban area of Cali. HR-QOL was assessed using the Short Form 8 (SF-8). LTPA and WT were measured using the long version of the International Physical Activity Questionnaire (IPAQ). Associations were assessed using linear regression models adjusting for potential confounders. Low (10-149 min) and medium-high (at least 150 min) levels of WT were negatively associated with the mental and physical dimensions of HR-QOL. Low (10-149 min of moderate intensity PA, or 10-74 min of vigorous intensity PA) and medium-high (at least 150 or 75 min of moderate or vigorous intensity PA, respectively) levels of LTPA were positively associated with both dimensions. Significant interactions were observed between education level and perceived safety from traffic.

METHODS: An ECLAMC routine for cluster evaluation (RUMOR) was followed that included: calculations of observed /expected ratios, site visits, comparison with comprehensively collected local, South American, and worldwide data, cluster analysis, and search for risk factors. RESULTS: All four Cali sirenomelia cases were born to mothers living in a 2 km(2) area, in neighboring communes, within the municipality of Cali. Considering the total births of the city of Cali as the denominator, and based on ECLAMC baseline birth prevalence rates (per 100,000) for sirenomelia (2.25, 95% CI: 2.66, 3.80), the cluster for this congenital abnormality was unlikely to have occurred by chance (observed/ expected ratio = 5.77; 95% CI: 1.57-14.78; p =.002). No consistent common factor was identified, but vicinity to an open landfill as the cause could not be rejected. Another ECLAMC hospital in San Justo, Buenos Aires, Argentina, reported three further cases but these did not seem to constitute a nonrandom cluster. CONCLUSIONS: The methodology used to evaluate the two possible clusters of sirenomelia determined that the Cali sirenomelia cluster was unlikely to have occurred by chance whereas the sirenomelia cluster from San Justo seemed to be random.

The World Health Organization (WHO) affirms that injuries related to burns are a global public health problem mainly in low-and middle-income countries. The first step towards reducing any preventable injury is based on accurate information. In Colombia, the basic epidemiological characteristics of burn injuries are unknown. The objectives were establishing the causes, high-risk populations, mortality rate, and tendencies of burn deaths. Methods: Observational, analytical, population-based study based on official death certificate occurred between 2000 and 2009. All codes of the International Classification of Diseases-10th Revision (ICD-10) related to burns were included. The mortality rates were standardized using the WHO world average age weights 2000-2025. To determine the tendency, an average annual percent change (AACP) was calculated. Results: A total of 5448 deaths due to burns were identified; 78.4 % were men. The crude and adjusted burn mortality rate was 1.270 and 1.302 per 100,000, respectively. The AACP was -5.25 %. Electrical injury caused the greatest number of deaths (49.5 %), followed by fire and lightning injuries. A total of 1197 (22.1 %) children were under 15 years old. The causes of deaths were different among age groups. 59.4 % deaths occurred outside health institutions. Conclusions: This study is a first step in identifying the main causes of death and groups with higher mortality rates. Electricity is the main cause of deaths due to burn injury.

As genetic heritability for IS is estimated at about 35%-40%, the identification of genetic variants associated with IS risk is of great importance. The main objective of this study was to carry out a meta-analysis for polymorphisms in CRP, EPHX2, FGA, and NOTCH3 genes and the risk for IS. Methods: Literature search for 6 candidate polymorphisms and IS was conducted using HuGE Navigator, PubMed, and Google Scholar databases. Meta-Analyst program was used to calculate pooled odds ratios (ORs) with a random effects model. Results: Twenty-five published studies for 6 candidate polymorphisms were included: CRP-rs1800947 (5 studies), CRP-rs1205 (3 studies), EPHX2-rs751141 (5 studies), FGA-rs6050 (6 studies), NOTCH3-rs3815188 (3 studies), and NOTCH3-rs1043994 (3 studies), for a total number of 7,825 IS cases and 56,532 control subjects. We did not find significant pooled ORs (P values > .05) for any of the genetic variants evaluated in this work. Conclusions: Our meta-analysis results did not show significant associations between these 6 polymorphisms in 4 candidate genes and IS, despite the functional role of some of these single nucleotide polymorphisms (e.g., rs6050 in FGA gene).

,,,13,WOS:000438481700013,2018,A tax on sugar sweetened beverages in Colombia: Estimating the impact on overweight and obesity prevalence across socio economic levels,"Colombia has a high prevalence of overweight (56%) and obesity (19%) among adults and is experiencing a growing trend in the prevalence of associated chronic conditions. Evidence suggests that sugar sweetened beverages (SSB) are associated to overweight/obesity, and that taxes on these beverages could reduce their associated health consequences. This paper assesses the potential effect of different levels of a SSB tax in Colombia on overweight and obesity prevalence. Using peer-reviewed local data on own-price elasticity of SSB, we applied a comparative risk assessment strategy to simulate the effect of the SSB tax on a nationally representative nutritional survey with 7140 adults in 2010 (ENSIN, 2010). Our results varied depending on the tax scenario, pass-through assumption and household socio economic strata (SES). We found that among individuals belonging to lower SES households, the SSB tax would reduce overweight and obesity between 1.5-4.9 and 1.1-2.4 percentage points (p < 0.05), respectively. Among individuals belonging to higher SES households, we found no statistically significant effects on obesity, and a reduction on overweight prevalence between 2.9 and 3.9 percentage points (p < 0.05). In the most conservative scenario (40% pass-through), a tax rate of at least 75 cents of Colombian peso (0.75 COP) per milliliter (24% of the average price) is needed to have statistically significant effects on both overweight and obesity prevalence among lower SES households. The results of this study suggest that a SSB tax could reduce the overweight and obesity prevalence in Colombia, especially among lower SES households. This study shows that SSB taxes have a particularly beneficial effect in the most vulnerable population. Additional social and individual benefits, or individual costs arising from the tax are not assessed in this research, implying that even larger health gains could be observed.",Article,"Vecino-Ortiz, A.I.; Arroyo-Ariza, D.",Colombia; Taxes; Sugar sweetened beverages; Overweight; Obesity,Colombia;Taxes;Sugar sweetened beverages;Overweight;Obesity;PASS-THROUGH;PRICES;HEALTH;METAANALYSIS;CONSUMPTION;BEHAVIOR;WELFARE;POLICY;RISK;FOOD,Colombia;United States,2-s2.0-85047630567;2-s2.0-85047630567

This skin type evaluation is easy to use in clinical practice but is not always applied as initially described, nor practiced in a standardised way. This can have implications on the results of relevant dermato-epidemiological studies. Objectives: To demonstrate, in a large multinational setting, that the phrasing of questions on sun sensitivity can have a strong impact on the perception and reporting of skin phototype, as well as the importance of a standardised procedure for phototype assessment. Materials & methods: Using data collected from 48,258 screenees of the Euromelanoma campaign in six European countries from 2009 to 2011, we analysed the impact of change in the question phrasing on phototype classification in each country. Results: Changing the wording of a question to assess the phototype of a person also significantly influenced the classification of phototypes in different countries (p < 0.001 for each country). The difference essentially corresponded to a shift towards a less sun-sensitive skin type when a shorter question that did not include skin colour description was used. The only exception was Portugal where phototype was not patient-assessed and classification shifted towards a more sun-sensitive phototype. Results were statistically significant and highly consistent, irrespective of gender. Conclusions : The phrasing of questions on skin type is important and substantially influences reporting.

Objective: To identify the presence of mutations in the Colombian population and evaluate two testing strategies. Methods: From a total universe of 853 individual blood samples referred for BRCA1 and BRCA2 typing, 256 cases were analyzed by complete direct sequencing of both genes in Myriad Genetics, and the remaining 597 cases were studied by partial sequencing based on founder mutations in a PCR test designed by ourselves (""Profile Colombia""). Results: We found 107 patients carrying deleterious mutations in this group of patients, 69 (64.5%) located in BRCA1, and 38 (35.5%) in BRCA2. Overall, we detected 39 previously unreported mutations in Colombia (22 in BRCA1 and 17 in BRCA2) and only 4 out of the 6 previously reported founder mutations. Sixty four out of 597 patients (10.7%) studied by ""Profile Colombia"" showed mutations in BRCA1 or BRCA2, and 41/256 patients (16%) showed mutations by complete BRCA1-BRCA2 sequencing.

The aim of this study was to analyze if the biological aggressiveness, underlined in ER+ BC tumors with higher AR/ER ratio, could be due to higher expression of genes related to cell proliferation. On a cohort of 47 ER+ BC patients, the AR/ER ratio was assessed by immunohistochemistry and by mRNA analysis. The expression level of five gene proliferation markers was defined through TaqMan((R))-qPCR assays. Results were validated using 979 BC cases obtained from gene expression public databases. ER+ BC tumors with ratios of AR/ER >= 2 have higher expression levels of cellular proliferation genes than tumors with ratios of AR/ER < 2, in both the 47 ER+ BC patients (P < 0.001) and in the validation cohort (P = 0.005). Moreover, BC cases with ratios of AR/ER >= 2 of the validation cohort were mainly assigned to luminal B and HER2-enriched molecular subtypes, typically characterized by higher proliferation and poorer prognosis. These data suggest that joint routine evaluation of AR and ER expression may identify a unique subset of tumors, which show higher levels of cellular proliferation and therefore a more aggressive behavior.",Article,"Rangel, N.; Rondon-Lagos, M.; Annaratone, L.; Aristizabal-Pachon, A.F.; Cassoni, P.; Sapino, A.; Castellano, I.",breast cancer; androgen receptor; estrogen receptor; crosstalk of nuclear receptors; proliferation genes,breast cancer;androgen receptor;estrogen receptor;crosstalk of nuclear receptors;proliferation genes;ANDROGEN RECEPTOR EXPRESSION;ER MESSENGER-RNA;GENE-EXPRESSION;CANCER CELLS;IN-SITU;ESTROGEN;CLASSIFICATION;CONTRIBUTE;RISK,Colombia;Italy,2-s2.0-85084169236

This study estimates its incidence, compares it with historical data and describes associated factors. Materials and methods: We carried out a prospective analytical cohort of preterm newborns <= 34 weeks of gestational age without major malformations from 12 health facilities from Bogota in 2004. The main outcomes were incidence and severity of bronchopulmonary dysplasia, which were compared with an historical cohort (1994-1999). Results: Neonatal mortality was 80/496, and the bronchopulmonary dysplasia incidence was 54.3% (95% CI, 49.4-59.1). When controlling for type of institution (low and high mortality) it appeared that being born in an institution with low mortality decreased the risk for death (OR=0.308; 95% CI, 0.129-0.736) but increased the odds for moderate-severe bronchopulmonary dysplasia (OR=1.797; 95% CI, 1.046-3.088). The risk for bronchopulmonary dysplasia was higher than for the historical control cohort (RR=1.924; 95% CI, 1.686-2.196). Weight and gestational age at birth, mechanical ventilation, intrauterine growth restriction and type of institution (low vs. intermediate-high mortality) were independently associated with bronchopulmonary dysplasia of increasing severity or even death. Conclusions: The frequency of bronchopulmonary dysplasia in Bogota has increased markedly, and this cannot be explained solely by better survival of more fragile infants. Survivors-irrespective from gestational age-have more frequent and more severe respiratory sequels. Probably suboptimal aggressive respiratory care practices associated with a recent transition from restricted to almost universal access to mechanical ventilation in neonatal intensive care units in Bogota might be compromising the quality of neonatal respiratory care.",Article,"Ruiz-Pelaez, J.G.; Charpak, N.",Infant; premature; bronchopulmonary dysplasia; kangaroo-mother care method; nurseries; hospitals; cohort studies; developing country,Infant;premature;bronchopulmonary dysplasia;kangaroo-mother care method;nurseries;hospitals;cohort studies;developing country;CHRONIC LUNG-DISEASE;RISK,Colombia,
,,,11,WOS:000382258100011,2016,Fine-Mapping of the 1p11.2 Breast Cancer Susceptibility Locus,"The Cancer Genetic Markers of Susceptibility genome-wide association study (GWAS) originally identified a single nucleotide polymorphism (SNP) rs11249433 at 1p11.2 associated with breast cancer risk. To fine-map this locus, we genotyped 92 SNPs in a 900kb region (120,505,799-121,481,132) flanking rs11249433 in 45,276 breast cancer cases and 48,998 controls of European, Asian and African ancestry from 50 studies in the Breast Cancer Association Consortium. Genotyping was done using iCOGS, a custom-built array. Due to the complicated nature of the region on chr1p11.2: 120,300,000-120,505,798, that lies near the centromere and contains seven duplicated genomic segments, we restricted analyses to 429 SNPs excluding the duplicated regions (42 genotyped and 387 imputed). Perallelic associations with breast cancer risk were estimated using logistic regression models adjusting for study and ancestry-specific principal components. The strongest association observed was with the original identified index SNP rs11249433 (minor allele frequency (MAF) 0.402; per-allele odds ratio (OR) = 1.10, 95% confidence interval (CI) 1.08-1.13, P = 1.49 x 10(-21)). The association for rs11249433 was limited to ER-positive breast cancers (test for heterogeneity P <= 8.41 x 10(-5)). Additional analyses by other tumor characteristics showed stronger associations with moderately/well differentiated tumors and tumors of lobular histology. Although no significant eQTL associations were observed, in silico analyses showed that rs11249433 was located in a region that is likely a weak enhancer/promoter. Fine-mapping analysis of the 1p11.2 breast cancer susceptibility locus confirms this region to be limited to risk to cancers that are ER-positive.",Article,"Horne, H.N.; Chung, C.C.; Zhang, H.; Yu, K.; Prokunina-Olsson, L.; Michailidou, K.; Bolla, M.K.; Wang, Q.; Dennis, J.; Hopper, J.L.; Southey, M.C.; Schmidt, M.K.; Broeks, A.; Muir, K.; Lophatananon, A.; Fasching, P.A.; Beckmann, M.W.; Fletcher, O.; Johnson, N.; Sawyer, E.J.; Tomlinson, I.; Burwinkel, B.; Marme, F.; Guenel, P.; Truong, T.; Bojesen, S.E.; Flyger, H.; Benitez, J.; Gonzalez-Neira, A.; Anton-Culver, H.; Neuhausen, S.L.; Brenner, H.; Arndt, V.; Meindl, A.; Schmutzler, R.K.; Brauch, H.; Hamann, U.; Nevanlinna, H.; Khan, S.; Matsuo, K.; Iwata, H.; Dork, T.; Bogdanova, N.V.; Lindblom, A.; Margolin, S.; Mannermaa, A.; Kosma, V.M.; Chenevix-Trench, G.; Wu, A.H.; den Berg, D.V.; Smeets, A.; Zhao, H.; Chang-Claude, J.; Rudolph, A.; Radice, P.; Barile, M.; Couch, F.J.; Vachon, C.; Giles, G.G.; Milne, R.L.; Haiman, C.A.; Le Marchand, L.; Goldberg, M.S.; Teo, S.H.; Taib, N.A.M.; Kristensen, V.; Borresen-Dale, A.L.; Zheng, W.; Shrubsole, M.; Winqvist, R.; Jukkola-Vuorinen, A.; Andrulis, I.L.; Knight, J.A.; Devilee, P.; Seynaeve, C.; Garcia-Closas, M.; Czene, K.; Darabi, H.; Hollestelle, A.; Martens, J.W.M.; Li, J.M.; Lu, W.; Shu, X.O.; Cox, A.; Cross, S.S.; Blot, W.; Cai, Q.Y.; Shah, M.; Luccarini, C.; Baynes, C.; Harrington, P.; Kang, D.; Choi, J.Y.; Hartman, M.; Chia, K.S.; Kabisch, M.; Torres, D.; Jakubowska, A.; Lubinski, J.; Sangrajrang, S.; Brennan, P.; Slager, S.; Yannoukakos, D.; Shen, C.Y.; Hou, M.F.; Swerdlow, A.; Orr, N.; Simard, J.; Hall, P.; Pharoah, P.D.P.; Easton, D.F.; Chanock, S.J.; Dunning, A.M.; Figueroa, J.D.",,GENOME-WIDE ASSOCIATION;COMMON VARIANTS;CONFER SUSCEPTIBILITY;GENETIC-VARIATION;14Q24.1 RAD51L1;RISK;HETEROGENEITY;ALLELES;DISEASE,United States;United Kingdom;Australia;Netherlands;Germany;France;Denmark;Spain;Finland;Japan;Sweden;Belgium;Italy;Canada;Malaysia;Norway;China;South Korea;Singapore;Colombia;Poland;Thailand;Greece;Taiwan,2-s2.0-84991088801

Monitoring of metal levels could serve as a biomarker of presence, or future development, of this disease. To this end, we evaluated the ability of flame atomic absorption spectrometry (FAAS) to assess the concentrations of Ca, Fe and Zn in hair of PD patients and to investigate if there was an association with age and disease duration. Hair samples were collected from 26 clinically-diagnosed PD patients, and 33 healthy individuals. Concentrations of Ca and Fe were lower in PD patients when compared to control, whereas, a higher concentration of Zn was detected in PD patients. Levels of Ca and Fe did not vary with age nor with the duration of PD. While Zn did not present variation with duration of the disease, there was a correlation with age as PD patients older than 65 years exhibited a higher concentration of Zn than controls. We conclude that FAAS is useful for detecting differences in Fe, Ca and Zn in hair samples of patients with PD. Hair samples required for this method are easy to collect, and the technique relies on a simple method of digestion of the organic matrix. The ease of use of FAAS should allow for more frequent monitoring of metallic levels in patients in a variety of small clinical situations, thereby offering the hope of allowing systematic tracking of metal levels as the disease progresses, or prior to the defining motor symptoms.",Article,"dos Santos, A.B.; Kohlmeier, K.A.; Rocha, M.E.; Barreto, G.E.; Barreto, J.A.; de Souza, A.C.A.; Bezerra, M.A.",Neurochemistry; Neurotoxicity; Metals unbalance; Neurodegenerative disease; Analytical methods,Neurochemistry;Neurotoxicity;Metals unbalance;Neurodegenerative disease;Analytical methods;OCCUPATIONAL-EXPOSURE;METALS;COPPER;ALZHEIMERS;BLOOD;TRACE;SERUM;RISK,Brazil;Denmark;Colombia;Chile,2-s2.0-85042183683
,,,11,WOS:000599817400069,2021,Low dose lead exposure induces alterations on heterochromatin hallmarks persisting through SH-SY5Y cell differentiation,"Lead (Pb) is a commonly found heavy metal due to its historical applications. Recent studies have associated early-life Pb exposure with the onset of various neurodegenerative disease. The molecular mechanisms of Pb conferring long-term neurotoxicity, however, is yet to be elucidated. In this study, we explored the persistency of alteration in epigenetic marks that arise from exposure to low dose of Pb using a combination of image-based and gene expression analysis. Using SH-SY5Y as a model cell line, we observed significant alterations in global 5-methycytosine (5 mC) and histone 3 lysine 27 tri-methylation (H3K27me3) and histone 3 lysine 9 tri-methylation (H3K9me3) levels in a dose-dependent manner immediately after Pb exposure. The changes are partially associated with alterations in epigenetic enzyme expression levels. Long term culturing (14 days) after cease of exposure revealed persistent changes in 5 mC, partial recovery in H3K9me3 and overcompensation in H3K27me3 levels. The observed alterations in H3K9me3 and H3K27me3 are reversed after neuronal differentiation, while reduction in 5 mC levels are amplified with significant changes in patterns as identified via texture clustering analysis. Moreover, correlation analysis demonstrates a strong positive correlation between trends of 5 mC alteration after differentiation and neuronal morphology. Collectively, our results suggest that exposure to low dose of Pb prior to differentiation can result in persistent epigenome alterations that can potentially be responsible for the observed phenotypic changes. Our work reveals that Pb induced changes in epigenetic repressive marks can persist through neuron differentiation, which provides a plausible mechanism underlying long-term neurotoxicity associated with developmental Pb-exposure.

Clinical genetic testing is commercially available for rs61764370, an inherited variant residing in a KRAS 3' UTR microRNA binding site, based on suggested associations with increased ovarian and breast cancer risk as well as with survival time. However, prior studies, emphasizing particular subgroups, were relatively small. Therefore, we comprehensively evaluated ovarian and breast cancer risks as well as clinical outcome associated with rs61764370. Methods. Centralized genotyping and analysis were performed for 140,012 women enrolled in the Ovarian Cancer Association Consortium (15,357 ovarian cancer patients; 30,816 controls), the Breast Cancer Association Consortium (33,530 breast cancer patients; 37,640 controls), and the Consortium of Modifiers of BRCA1 and BRCA2 (14,765 BRCA1 and 7904 BRCA2 mutation carriers). Results. We found no association with risk of ovarian cancer (OR = 0.99, 95% CI 0.94-1.04, p = 0.74) or breast cancer (OR = 0.98, 95% CI 0.94-1.01, p = 0.19) and results were consistent among mutation carriers (BRCA1, ovarian cancer HR = 1.09, 95% CI 0.97-1.23, p = 0.14, breast cancer HR = 1.04, 95% CI 0.97-1.12, p = 0.27; BRCA2, ovarian cancer HR = 0.89, 95% CI 0.71-1.13, p = 034, breast cancer HR = 1.06, 95% CI 0.94-1.19, p = 0.35). Null results were also obtained for associations with overall survival following ovarian cancer (HR = 0.94, 95% CI 0.83-1.07, p = 0.38), breast cancer (HR = 0.96, 95% CI 0.87-1.06, p = 0.38), and all other previously-reported associations. Conclusions. rs61764370 is not associated with risk of ovarian or breast cancer nor with clinical outcome for patients with these cancers. Therefore, genotyping this variant has no clinical utility related to the prediction or management of these cancers. (C) 2015 Elsevier Inc.

The effect of IDeg has not been specifically assessed in patients with unstable diabetes, defined as increased glycemic variability (GV). Methods: A prospective before-after pilot study was conducted, including patients managed at Hospital Universitario San Ignacio in Bogota, Colombia. The impact of the switch from a Glargine or Detemir insulin to a basal insulin regimen with IDeg for 12 weeks on GV measured by continuous glucose monitoring, on A1c levels, and on the incidence of episodes of global and nocturnal hypoglycemia was assessed in a group of patients with (coefficient of variation > 34%) or without increased basal GV using a Generalised Estimating Equation (GEE) analysis. Results: 60 patients with basal bolus therapy and history of hypoglycemia were included. 18 patients had High GV (HGV). In this group a significant reduction of 11.1% of CV (95% CI: 6.3, 15.9, p=0.01) was found. GEE analysis confirmed a higher impact over time on patients with HGV (p < 0.001). The percentage of patients with at least 1 episode of hypoglycemia decreased from 66.6% to 22.2% (p=0.02) and from 37.14% to 5.71% (p < 0.01) for global and nocturnal hypoglycemia, respectively. Changes were not significant in patients with low GV. A reduction of A1c was observed in both groups (p < 0.001).

ANPD has the ability to bind DNA, thus produce genotoxic damage. In this way, XRCC1 and XRCC3 proteins are necessary for efficient DNA repair and polymorphisms in this genes can be associated with an individual response to ANPD exposure. Therefore, the aim of this study was to evaluate genetic damage of occupational exposure to antineoplastic drugs and the possible effect of XRCC1 and XRCC3 polymorphisms in oncology employees from Bogota, Colombia. Peripheral blood samples were obtained from 80 individuals, among exposed workers and healthy controls. The comet assay and Cytokinesis-block micronucleus cytome assay was performed to determinate genetic damage. From every sample DNA was isolated and genotyping for XRCC1 (Arg194Trp, Arg280His and Arg399Gln) and XRCC3 (Thr241Met) SNPs by PCR-RFLP. The exposed group showed a significant increase of comet assay results and micronucleus frequency, compared with unexposed group. It was observed a gender, exposure time and workplace effect on comet assay results. Our results showed no significant associations of comet assay results and micronucleus frequency with either genotype, allele, nor haplotype of XRCC1 and XRCC3 SNPs.

Purpose: We examined associations of perceived school cohesion and student-school connectedness with physical victimization, verbal victimization, and social exclusion in the past six months in adolescents in grades 6-11 (N = 774) attending 11 public and private urban schools in Colombia. Methods: Cross-sectional data were collected via a self-administered questionnaire and analyzed using mixed-effects linear regression models. Results: Higher perceived school cohesion was inversely related with exposure to three bullying types examined (p < 0.05); student-school connectedness was negatively related to verbal victimization among girls only (p < 0.01). In full models, school cohesion maintained inverse associations with three bullying types after controlling for student-school connectedness (p = 0.05).

This study aimed to investigate the impact of SES on diet quality and body mass index in Latin America. Data from the ""Latin American Health and Nutrition Study (ELANS)"", a multi-country, population-based study of 9218 participants, were used. Dietary intake was collected through two 24 h recalls from participants of Argentina, Brazil, Chile, Colombia, Costa Rica, Ecuador, Peru and Venezuela. Diet quality was assessed using the dietary quality score (DQS), the dietary diversity score (DDS) and the nutrients adequacy ratio (NAR). Chi-squared and multivariate-variance analyses were used to estimate possible associations. We found that participants from the low SES consumed less fruits, vegetables, whole grains, fiber and fish and seafood and more legumes than those in the high SES. Also, the diet quality level, assessed by DQS, DDS and NAR mean, increased with SES. Women in the low SES also showed a larger prevalence of abdominal obesity and excess weight than those in the middle and high SES.

Its limited specificity demands using a second (triage) test to better identify women at high-risk of cervical disease. Cytology represents the immediate triage but its low sensitivity might hamper HPV testing sensitivity, particularly in low-income and middle-income countries (LMICs), where cytology performance has been suboptimal. The ESTAMPA (EStudio multicentrico de TAMizaje y triaje de cancer de cuello uterino con pruebas del virus del PApiloma humano; Spanish acronym) study will: (1) evaluate the performance of different triage techniques to detect cervical precancer and (2) inform on how to implement HPV-based screening programmes in LMIC. Methods and analysis Women aged 30-64 years are screened with HPV testing and Pap across 12 study centres in Latin America. Screened positives have colposcopy with biopsy and treatment of lesions. Women with no evident disease are recalled 18 months later for another HPV test; those HPV-positive undergo colposcopy with biopsy and treatment as needed. Biological specimens are collected in different visits for triage testing, which is not used for clinical management. The study outcome is histological high-grade squamous intraepithelial or worse lesions (HSIL+) under the lower anogenital squamous terminology. About 50000 women will be screened and 500 HSIL+ cases detected (at initial and 18 months screening). Performance measures (sensitivity, specificity and predictive values) of triage techniques to detect HSIL+ will be estimated and compared with adjustment by age and study centre. Ethics and dissemination The study protocol has been approved by the Ethics Committee of the International Agency for Research on Cancer (IARC), of the Pan American Health Organisation (PAHO) and by those in each participating centre. A Data and Safety Monitoring Board (DSMB) has been established to monitor progress of the study, assure participant safety, advice on scientific conduct and analysis and suggest protocol improvements.

Hypertensive disorders of pregnancy (HDP) are major contributors to maternal and neonatal morbidity and mortality worldwide; likewise, umbilical cord anatomical abnormalities (UCAA) are linked to poor neonatal outcomes. Based on the relationship described between PE and UCAA and the role of the VEGF family in PE, this study explored VEGF expression in placental and UC tissued from patients with PE and with UCAA. Methods: We performed an observational, analytical study on placentas, comparing protein and mRNA expression in four groups: patients with PE, patients with UC abnormalities, patients with both, and patients with none of them. Using immunohistochemistty, we studied VEGF A, VEGF R1 (FLT1), MMP1, and PLGF. With quantitative reverse transcription polymerase chain reaction we described mRNA expression of PLGF, VEGF and sFLT1, and sFLT1/PLGF ratio. Results: Forty newborns were included. Sixty-seven percent of mothers and 45% of newborns developed no complications. Immunohistochemistry was performed on UC and placental disc paraffin-embedded tissue; in the latter, the mRNA of the VEGF family was also measured. Statistically significant differences were observed among different expressions in both HDP and UCAA groups. Interestingly, the UCAA group exhibited lower levels of sFLT1 and VEGF-A in comparison with other groups, with significant P-value for sFLT1 (P=0000.1).

Associations between genotyped SNPs and overall breast cancer risk, and secondarily according to estrogen receptor (ER) status, were assessed using multiple logistic regression models. Gene-level associations were assessed based on principal component analysis. Gene expression analyses were conducted using RNA sequencing level 3 data from The Cancer Genome Atlas for 989 breast tumor samples and 113 matched normal tissue samples.

The aim of the present study was to determine the impact, in terms of efficacy and safety, of previous maintenance treatment on severe asthma exacerbations. Patients and Methods: We retrospectively evaluated the clinical characteristics of exacerbations experienced by 1543 patients with moderate persistent and severe persistent asthma. Drug therapy was as follows: a combination of inhaled LABAs and corticosteroids (493 patients), an inhaled corticosteroid only (456 patients), and no maintenance treatment (594 patients). Results: Asthmatic patients taking LABAs did not show higher mortality, longer stay in the intensive care unit, longer hospital stay, lower pH, or worse airflow obstruction than the other 2 groups. On the contrary, they had a higher mean (SD) forced expiratory volume in 1 second at discharge (54% [16%]) than patients taking inhaled corticosteroids (48% [19%]) and patients taking no maintenance treatment (48% [20%]) (P=.009). Patients taking no maintenance treatment also had lower mean (SD) pH values (7.37 [0.11]) than patients taking LABAs (7.39 [0.09]) and patients taking inhaled corticosteroids (7.39 [0.08]) (P=.002), and more admissions to the intensive care unit (11.1% vs 6.5% and 7.7%: P=.002 and P=.018, respectively). Conclusions: This study did not reveal higher morbidity or mortality in severe asthma exacerbations in patients with moderate persistent or severe persistent asthma who had received inhaled LABAs combined with inhaled corticosteroids.

Objectives We propose that healthy behaviors could lower the incidence of frailty. The aim is to describe the association between healthy behaviors (physical activity, vaccination, tobacco use, and cancer screening) and the incidence of frailty. Design This is a secondary longitudinal analysis of the Mexican Health and Aging Study (MHAS) cohort. Setting MHAS is a population-based cohort, of community-dwelling Mexican older adults. With five assessments currently available, for purposes of this work, 2012 and 2015 waves were used. Participants A total of 6,087 individuals 50-year or older were included. Measurements: Frailty was defined using a 39-item frailty index. Healthy behaviors were assessed with questions available in MHAS. Individuals without frailty in 2012 were followed-up three years in order to determine their frailty incidence, and its association with healthy behaviors. Multivariate logistic regression models were used to assess the odds of frailty occurring according to the four health-related behaviors mentioned above. Results At baseline (2012), 55.2% of the subjects were male, the mean age was 62.2 (SD +/- 8.5) years old. The overall incidence (2015) of frailty was 37.8%. Older adults physically active had a lower incidence of frailty (48.9% vs. 42.2%, p< 0.0001). Of the activities assessed in the adjusted multivariate models, physical activity was the only variable that was independently associated with a lower risk of frailty (odds ratio: 0.79, 95% confidence interval 0.71-0.88, p< 0.001). Conclusions Physically active older adults had a lower 3-year incidence of frailty even after adjusting for confounding variables. Increasing physical activity could therefore represent a strategy for reducing the incidence of frailty. Other so-called healthy behaviors were not associated with incident frailty, however there is still uncertainty on the interpretation of those results.",Article,"Borda, M.G.; Perez-Zepeda, M.U.; Samper-Ternent, R.; Gomez, R.C.; Avila-Funes, J.A.; Cano-Gutierrez, C.A.",Frailty; age; healthy lifestyle; epidemiology of aging; healthy aging,Frailty;age;healthy lifestyle;epidemiology of aging;healthy aging;PHYSICAL-ACTIVITY;OLDER-ADULTS;HEALTH;EXERCISE;RISK,Norway;Colombia;Mexico;Canada;United States;France,2-s2.0-85087138311
,,,6,WOS:000366545900034,2015,A polymorphism in the base excision repair gene PARP2 is associated with differential prognosis by chemotherapy among postmenopausal breast cancer patients,"Background: Personalized therapy considering clinical and genetic patient characteristics will further improve breast cancer survival. Two widely used treatments, chemotherapy and radiotherapy, can induce oxidative DNA damage and, if not repaired, cell death. Since base excision repair (BER) activity is specific for oxidative DNA damage, we hypothesized that germline genetic variation in this pathway will affect breast cancer-specific survival depending on treatment. Methods: We assessed in 1,408 postmenopausal breast cancer patients from the German MARIE study whether cancer specific survival after adjuvant chemotherapy, anthracycline chemotherapy, and radiotherapy is modulated by 127 Single Nucleotide Polymorphisms (SNPs) in 21 BER genes. For SNPs with interaction terms showing p < 0.1 (likelihood ratio test) using multivariable Cox proportional hazard analyses, replication in 6,392 patients from nine studies of the Breast Cancer Association Consortium (BCAC) was performed. Results: rs878156 in PARP2 showed a differential effect by chemotherapy (p = 0.093) and was replicated in BCAC studies (p = 0.009; combined analysis p = 0.002). Compared to non-carriers, carriers of the variant G allele (minor allele frequency = 0.07) showed better survival after chemotherapy (combined allelic hazard ratio (HR) = 0.75, 95 % 0.53-1.07) and poorer survival when not treated with chemotherapy (HR = 1.42, 95 % 1.08-1.85). A similar effect modification by rs878156 was observed for anthracycline-based chemotherapy in both MARIE and BCAC, with improved survival in carriers (combined allelic HR = 0.73, 95 % CI 0.40-1.32). None of the SNPs showed significant differential effects by radiotherapy. Conclusions: Our data suggest for the first time that a SNP in PARP2, rs878156, may together with other genetic variants modulate cancer specific survival in breast cancer patients depending on chemotherapy. These germline SNPs could contribute towards the design of predictive tests for breast cancer patients.",Article,"Seibold, P.; Schmezer, P.; Behrens, S.; Michailidou, K.; Bolla, M.K.; Wang, Q.; Flesch-Janys, D.; Nevanlinna, H.; Fagerholm, R.; Aittomaki, K.; Blomqvist, C.; Margolin, S.; Mannermaa, A.; Kataja, V.; Kosma, V.M.; Hartikainen, J.M.; Lambrechts, D.; Wildiers, H.; Kristensen, V.; Alnaes, G.G.; Nord, S.; Borresen-Dale, A.L.; Hooning, M.J.; Hollestelle, A.; Jager, A.; Seynaeve, C.; Li, J.M.; Liu, J.J.; Humphreys, K.; Dunning, A.M.; Rhenius, V.; Shah, M.; Kabisch, M.; Torres, D.; Ulmer, H.U.; Hamann, U.; Schildkraut, J.M.; Purrington, K.S.; Couch, F.J.; Hall, P.; Pharoah, P.; Easton, D.F.; Schmidt, M.K.; Chang-Claude, J.; Popanda, O.",Survival; Genetic variation; Chemotherapy; Radiotherapy; Anthracyclines,Survival;Genetic variation;Chemotherapy;Radiotherapy;Anthracyclines;STRESS-RELATED GENES;POLY(ADP-RIBOSE) POLYMERASES;DOXORUBICIN;EXPRESSION;RISK;IMPACT;DAMAGE;XRCC1,Germany;United Kingdom;Finland;Sweden;Belgium;Norway;Netherlands;Singapore;Colombia;United States,2-s2.0-84959139071

We have studied the socioeconomic inequalities in current smoking, ever smoking, and smoking cessation in Colombia by age-group and gender. Methods: Sixty thousand, three hundred and forty-nine Colombian men and women aged 12-69 years were selected at random from the results of a national survey. We used Pearson's chi-square and Robust Poisson regression analyses to estimate adjusted prevalence ratios between smoking behaviors and 2 indicators of socioeconomic position; individuals' educational level and household socioeconomic stratum. Results: In men aged 45-69 years, higher socioeconomic stratum and higher education were associated with a lower rate of current smoking (PR = 0.49 [95% CI, 0.32-0.73] and PR = 0.64 [95% CI, 0.47-0.86], respectively), a history of smoking (PR = 0.67 [95% CI, 0.53-0.85] and PR = 0.75 [95% CI, 0.63-0.90], respectively), or a higher rate of smoking cessation (PR = 1.37 [95% CI, 1.09-1.72] and PR = 0.18 [95% CI, 0.99-1.72], respectively). In men aged 18-44 years, higher education was associated with lower odds of current and history of smoking (PR = 0.75 [95% CI, 0.61-0.92 and PR = 0.81 [95% CI, 0.67-0.98], respectively). Results in women and adolescents were mixed. Conclusions: In Colombia, the overall declining prevalence of smoking in men seems to be accompanied by a narrowing of smoking inequalities in successive birth cohorts, suggesting a favorable evolution of the tobacco epidemic.

We evaluated the prevalence and risk factors for depressive symptoms in patients with diabetes using data from the International Diabetes Management Practices Study (IDMPS). RESEARCH DESIGN AND METHODS IDMPS is an ongoing multinational, cross-sectional study investigating quality of care in patients with diabetes in real-world settings. Data from wave 5 (2011), including 21 countries, were analyzed using the 9-item Patient Health Questionnaire (PHQ-9) to evaluate depressive symptoms. Logistic regression analyses were conducted to identify risk factors of depressive symptoms. RESULTS Of 9,865 patients eligible for analysis, 2,280 had type 1 and 7,585 had type 2 diabetes (treatment: oral glucose-lowering drugs [OGLD] only, n = 4,729; OGLDs plus insulin, n = 1,892; insulin only, n = 964). Depressive symptoms (PHQ-9 score >= 5) were reported in 30.7% of those with type 1 diabetes. In patients with type 2 diabetes, the respective figures were 29.0% for OGLDs-only, 36.6% for OGLDs-plus-insulin, and 46.7% for insulin-only subgroups. Moderate depressive symptoms (PHQ-9 score 10-19) were observed in 8-16% of patients with type 1 or type 2 diabetes. Female sex, complications, and low socioeconomic status were independently associated with depressive symptoms. In type 1 diabetes and in the type 2 diabetes OGLDs-only group, depression was associated with poor glycemic control.

Objective: To estimate the prevalence of HBP, knowledge, treatment and control in population aged >= 60 years, resident in Colombia, according to their ethnic condition. Methods: Population sample selected by multistage sampling. Ethnicity was defined based on skin color. HBP was defined as systolic blood pressure >= 140, and/or diastolic blood pressure >= 90 mm Hg, and/or the participants' self-report. Controlled HBP at a blood pressure value < 140/90, knowledge and treatment were identified by self-report. Results: 23,694 adults aged >= 60 years were included, of which 54.5%, 34.5% and 10.9% were respectively identified as having light, medium or dark skin color; 54.5% were women, and 78.1% resided in urban areas. The standardized prevalence of HBP, by age, was 57.7% (95% CI: 55.2 -60.2); 51.4% (95% CI: 47.3-55. 5), in men; and 62.9% (60.964.9), in women. The standardized prevalence for light, medium and dark skin in men was 53.2% (95% CI: 48.7-57.7), 49.6% (44.5-54.7), and 49.4% (95% CI: 41.0-57.8) respectively; and in women was 62.5% (95% CI: 60.5-64, 5), 61.7% (95% CI: 57.865.6), and 69.9% (95% CI: 63.6-76.2) respectively. 98% of the population received treatment, and 93.9% were aware of HBP diagnosis. 42.5% of men and 55.5% of women with HBP were under control.

Methods Exposures (based on the weighted daily root mean square acceleration, A(8); the daily vibration dose value, VDV(8); and the daily equivalent static compression dose, S-ed(8)) of 2302 workers during 4 years were estimated using each worker's monthly vehicle operation records and WBV measurements from 11 different types of heavy equipment vehicles in a large coal mine. Company payroll data provided work absence during the concurrent 4 years of exposure. Cox regression models estimated the associations between the different WBV metrics and time to first work absence related to back pain. An adjusted R-2 statistic provided a measure of model fit. Results All estimated metrics of WBV exposures were positively and significantly associated with back pain-related absence. HRs varied from 2.03 to 12.39 for every 0.21 m/s(2) increase in the A(8)-based exposures; from 1.03 to 1.18 for every 1.72 m/s(1.75) increase in VDV(8)-based exposures; and from 1.04 to 1.07 for every 0.06 MPa increase in S-ed(8)-based exposures. Models using the estimated VDV(8) metric for the z axis fit the data best as measured by the R-2 statistic.

To characterize the intake of folic acid (FA) and other micronutrients in medicinal form in a group of pregnant women in Colombia. Methods. Descriptive observational study. Information was obtained from interviews of pregnant women and from the clinical records of their prenatal check-ups and/or delivery in four cities in Colombia. The sample consisted of 1 637 women seen in 15 institutions. Results. A total of 1 315 pregnant women (80.3%) were advised to take FA, and 84% received a prescription, 90.3% of whom adhered to the treatment. FA was provided to 85.6% of them by their health insurance company and 10.7% purchased it themselves.

Treatment aims to avoid relapses and disability progression. The purpose of this study was to evaluate the cost-effectiveness of natalizumab compared with fingolimod for treating highly active relapsing-remitting MS (RRMS) patients from the Colombian third-party payer perspective. Methods: We used a Markov economic model from the perspective of the Colombian healthcare system to estimate the cost-effectiveness of natalizumab compared with fingolimod for RRMS with high disease activity or failure of interferons as first-line therapy. This model was centered on disability progression and relapses. We considered a 5-year time horizon with a 5% discount rate. We included only direct medical costs. Local experts were consulted to obtain resource utilization estimates, and local standardized costing methodologies and sources were used. Outcome was considered in terms of quality-adjusted life-years (QALYs). Utilities were extracted or calculated from the literature. Transition probabilities were calculated from available efficacy and safety information (1 USD = 3050.98 COP). Results: Natalizumab showed lower total costs (USD 80 024 vs USD 98 137) and higher QALY yield (3.01 vs 2.94) than fingolimod, dominating it (incremental cost-effectiveness ratio = -$1861). Univariate sensitivity analysis showcased the relevance of the measures of effect on disability progression for natalizumab on model results.

Objectives To understand physician beliefs and behaviour and identify uncertainties in dyslipidaemia management across four world regions. Methods Web-based survey of 1758 physicians in Japan, Germany, Colombia and the Philippines who were selected randomly from existing databases. Key inclusion criteria were 1) for cardiologists and diabetes/endocrinology specialists: >= 50 dyslipidaemia patients examined in the last month; 2) for specialists in neurology/neurosurgery/stroke medicine: >= 50 dyslipidaemia patients and >= 20 patients with a history of ischaemic stroke examined in the last month; and 3) for specialists in nephrology and general medicine: based at centres with >= 20 beds and >= 50 dyslipidaemia patients examined in the last month. The self-report survey covered dyslipidaemia management, target low-density lipoprotein cholesterol (LDL-C) levels in different patient groups, and statin safety. All physicians gave voluntary consent and all data were anonymised. Analysis was solely descriptive. Results The survey highlighted key areas of uncertainty in dyslipidaemia management in the four countries. These related to LDL-C targets in different patient groups, the safety of low LDL-C levels, the safety of statins, especially for effects on cognitive, renal and hepatic function and for haemorrhagic stroke risk, and lipid management strategies in patients with chronic kidney disease, including those with concomitant hypertriglyceridaemia. Conclusions This survey of physicians in Japan, Germany, Colombia and the Philippines has identified key gaps in knowledge about dyslipidaemia management.

Additionally, hyperglycemia, independent of associated comorbidities, is related to the loss of muscle mass and strength, and contributes to functional impairment in older adults. We studied the mediation effect of glucose levels, in the relationship between abdominal obesity and relative handgrip strength (HGS). A total of 1571 participants (60.0% women, mean age 69.1 +/- 7.0 years) from 86 municipalities were selected following a multistage area probability sampling design. Measurements included demographic and anthropometric/adiposity markers (weight, height, body mass index, and waist circumference). HGS was measured using a digital dynamometer for three sets and the mean value was recorded. The values were normalized to body weight (relative HGS). Fasting glucose was analyzed by enzymatic colorimetric methods. Mediation analyses were performed to identify associations between the independent variable (abdominal obesity) and outcomes (relative HGS), as well as to determine whether fasting glucose levels mediated the relationship between excess adiposity and relative HGS. A total of 1239 (78.8%) had abdominal obesity. Abdominal obesity had a negative effect on fasting glucose (beta = 9.04, 95%CI = 5.87 to 12.21); while fasting glucose to relative HGS was inversely related (beta = -0.003, 95%CI = -0.005 to -0.001),p< 0.001. The direct effect of abdominal obesity on relative HGS was statistically significant (beta = -0.069, 95%CI = -0.082 to -0.057),p< 0.001. Lastly, fasting glucose levels mediates the detrimental effect of abdominal obesity on relative HGS (indirect effect beta = -0.002, 95%CI = -0.004 to -0.001),p< 0.001. Our results suggest that the glucose level could worsen the association between abdominal obesity status and lower HGS.

The sustainable diets approach has emerged to address the multidimensional challenge of reaching a context-based diet that minimizes negative environmental impacts, provides health and nutrition to all segments of the population, and is affordable and coherent with the local culture and traditions. The aim of this study was to explore the prospects for meat consumption reduction and challenges encompassing the environmental, and health spheres. In order to do so, we analyzed: (1) The current carbon and water per capita footprints for two animal-based options and two plant-based options; and (2) the contribution of each food alternative to the local dietary reference intakes based on average per capita daily consumption and significant differences among the nutrient values for each food alternative through a two proportion Z-test. Our results show that the annual per capita carbon and water footprints for beef were higher compared to other alternatives, despite a higher per capita consumption of chicken. Also, our findings reveal that the average consumption of beef and chicken contributes 39% of the maximum recommended daily intake for cholesterol and 61% of the Recommended Dietary Allowance for protein in the country. Finally, relevant promoting forces and barriers related to meat consumption reduction were identified based on the two dimensions evaluated. This study calls for a joint effort to make changes in public policy, food systems, and consumer education.",Article,"Blanco-Murcia, L.; Ramos-Mejia, M.",sustainable diets; sustainable food consumption; environmental impacts of meat; health impacts of meat; meat consumption reduction,sustainable diets;sustainable food consumption;environmental impacts of meat;health impacts of meat;meat consumption reduction;FOOD-CONSUMPTION;HEART-DISEASE;HEALTH;RED;IMPACTS;CHOICES;RISK;LIFE,Colombia,2-s2.0-85076453948;2-s2.0-85076453948;2-s2.0-85076453948

OBJECTIVE: To conduct an ergonomic intervention to reduce mechanical exposures on workers during manual flower cutting, while emphasizing postural education and reduction of force requirements. PARTICIPANTS: Seventy seven workers (20 to 55 years old; 80% women) from six companies that cultivate roses participated in this study. METHODS: Participants from three companies were randomly assigned to control and intervention groups. A postural education program and a maintenance program was designed and implemented in the intervention group aiming to achieve more neutral postures of the wrist and forearm and to reduce force requirements during rose cutting. Changes in self-reported effort and upper extremity postures, kinematics and muscular activity between baseline and follow-up assessments were evaluated. RESULTS: Most of the observed changes in the evaluated mechanical exposures were moderate for both groups. The intervention group showed differential improvements compared to the control group for 95th percentile forearm pronation (intervention group went from 50.6 to 35.6 degrees; control group went from 18.4 to 34.7 degrees); and to some degree for the maximum wrist radial deviation (the intervention group went from 17 degrees to 7.6 degrees; control group went from 10.1 degrees to 7.8 degrees). Also, the mean elbow flexion for the control group was reduced from 62.3 to 48.4 degrees, whereas it increased from 52.2 to 57.3 degrees in the intervention group. No differential changes between the intervention and control groups were observed for the kinematic variables, except for an unexpected reduction in the 95th percentile velocity of wrist flexion-extension in the control group, which was not observed in the intervention group. Lastly, although observed changes in muscular activity were not statistically significant, improvements were observed for the intervention group for the flexor and extensor carpi radialis and the flexor carpi ulnaris; although the opposite was true for the extensor carpi ulnaris. CONCLUSIONS: Important although sometimes mixed results were achieved with this field intervention, focusing on postural and force requirement demands.

It is a protective factor against mental health problems. This process can be influenced by environmental and genetic factors. Several genes have been associated with interindividual differences in resilience levels, but the results are inconclusive. Therefore, the aim of this meta-analysis was to evaluate the effect of a functional polymorphism (5-HTTLPR) in the SLC6A4 gene on resilience levels. A search in PubMed, HugeNavigator and Google Scholar databases was carried out and 16 studies about the association of 5-HTTLPR polymorphism and resilience in humans were identified. The Open-Meta[Analyst] program was employed to perform statistical analysis using a random-effects model. The final analysis included 9 studies, for a total of 4,080 subjects. Significant results were found when the standardized mean differences (SMD) of LL and SL carriers were compared, (SMD: -0.087 (confidence interval: -0.166 to -0.008; I-2 : 0 %); P value: 0.031).

No study has focused on simultaneous evaluation of associations between iron stores and the above cardiometabolic diseases (CMD) in the same population. We aim to evaluate the association between serum ferritin and risk of T2D, CHD and CEVD in Scottish population over a wide range of ferritin levels. Methods Longitudinal study in 6,497 participants of the 1995 and 1998 Scottish health surveys, who were followed-up until 2011. Cox regression models were conducted adjusting for age, sex/menopausal status, fibrinogen, GGT levels, smoking, alcohol consumption, total cholesterol, HDL-cholesterol, blood pressure, and BMI. Ferritin was used as continuous (sex/menopausal status-specific Z score) and categorical variable (sex/menopausal status-specific quartiles, quintiles and sextiles). Results During follow-up, 4.9% of the participants developed T2D, 5.3% CHD, and 2.3% CEVD. By using ferritin quartiles, serum ferritin was positively associated with T2D, CHD and CEVD but only the association with T2D remained after adjustment for covariates [Quartile 4 v. 1: adjusted HR 95% CI 1.59 (1.10-2.34); P = 0.006].

There is ample epidemiological literature that relates economic growth to the reduction of infectious and childhood diseases. Less evidence exists to document if economic growth alone is enough to reverse the increasing trends of injury mortality and morbidity among seniors in a middle-income country. Aim To investigate the association between economic growth and injury deaths among older people in Colombia. Method Using data from Colombia, 1979-2006 (n=28), time-series models were used to ascertain if the variation over time in injury mortality among seniors is related to short-term oscillations in economic performance. Four empirical specifications usually used in the analysis of such data were implemented. Models were run by type of injury and gender. Results A negative but moderate effect of economic growth was found on injury deaths among older people. The reported elasticity was between -0.98 and -1.26. Men benefit from economic growth more than women. Economic growth seems to reduce traffic injuries, suicides and homicides. A positive association was also found between falls and growth in gross domestic product. Conclusions The results indicate a non-homogeneous association between economic growth and injury deaths among seniors in Colombia. This association is usually stronger in a negative direction among children and younger adults. Although more research is needed to understand the causal relationship between economic growth and injury, the association found may suggest that economic growth may not be sufficient to reverse injury deaths among older people; therefore, additional health policies need to be in place to reduce mortality due to preventable injuries in seniors.",Article,"Trujillo, A.J.; Hyder, A.A.; Ruiz, F.",,OLDER-ADULTS;CHANGING RELATION;FALLS;PREVENTION;FRACTURES;EXERCISE;PROGRAM;PEOPLE;LEVEL;RISK,United States;Colombia,2-s2.0-78649792130

Design Cross-classified study. Setting 68 Swedish hospitals. Participants 43 247 patients admitted between 2007 and 2009, with a first-ever AMI. Primary and secondary outcome measures We evaluate hospital performance by analysing differences in 30-day mortality after a first-ever AMI using a cross-classified multilevel analysis. We classified the patients into 10 categories according to a risk score (RS) for 30-day mortality and created 680 strata defined by combining hospital and RS categories. Results In the cross-classified multilevel analysis the overall RS adjusted hospital 30-day mortality in Sweden was 4.78% and the between-hospital variation was very small (variance partition coefficient (VPC)=0.70%, area under the curve (AUC)=0.54). The benchmark value was therefore achieved by all hospitals. However, as expected, there were large differences between the RS categories (VPC=34.13%, AUC=0.77) Conclusions MAIHDA is a useful tool to evaluate hospital performance. The benefit of this novel approach to adjusting for patient RS is that it allowed one to estimate separate VPCs and AUC statistics to simultaneously evaluate the influence of RS categories and hospital differences on mortality. At the time of our analysis, all hospitals in Sweden were performing homogeneously well. That is, the benchmark target for 30-day mortality was fully achieved and there were not relevant hospital differences.

The first one thousand days are a window of opportunity to program health and disease. Exclusive breastfeeding may protect against obesity; however, it is not consistently practiced. Obesity rates have been increasing worldwide. Overweight or obese women have lower rates of breastfeeding and face mechanical, psychological and biological difficulties. Breastfeeding counselling is a successful strategy to support breastfeeding in normal weight women; but there is a lack of evidence on its effectiveness in overweight women. Our purpose is to evaluate a new approach to exclusive breastfeeding counselling based on Carl Rogers' Centred-Client Theory in overweight women, and to examine effects on breastfeeding prevalence, infant growth velocity and maternal postpartum weight loss. Methods A two-arm simple randomized controlled trial will be conducted in overweight and obese women recruited in a Baby Friendly Hospital in Bogota, Colombia. The intervention is exclusive breastfeeding counselling based on Rogers' theory but adapted for overweight women; it will be performed during the last month of pregnancy, 24 h after delivery and during early infancy (1 and 3 months postpartum). The primary outcomes will be exclusive breastfeeding prevalence, infant growth velocity and maternal weight loss from birth up to 4 months after delivery; and the secondary outcomes will be prolactin and macronutrient levels in breast milk and serum prolactin levels. Intention to treat analysis will be performed to estimate the effect of the new counselling approach compared to standard management on the prevalence of exclusive breastfeeding, infant growth velocity and maternal weight loss.

Accordingly, gait speed could be a factor that improves or worsens the relationship between obesity and dependence in activities of daily living (ADL). However, to date this potential role has not been examined and the minimum gait speed threshold in the relationship between obesity and ADL is not known. The aim of this study was to determine whether speed moderates the association between obesity and dependence in ADL, and also define the gait speed threshold of this relationship. Methods: A total of 20,507 community-dwelling older adults from a cross-sectional analysis of national survey data - the Colombian Health, Well-being and Aging study (SABE, 2015) - were surveyed. The research data were collected using structured questionnaires, including basic information, ADL measured using the Barthel Index, body mass index, and gait speed (3 m). The Johnson-Neyman technique was applied to determine the gait speed threshold adjusted for age, sex and comorbidities. Results: Regression analysis showed a significant detrimental effect of obesity on dependence in ADL, which was moderated by gait speed (beta = 0.081; 95%CI: 0.045 to 0.117; p < 0.001). Adjusted for major covariates, the Johnson-Neyman technique defined two gait speed thresholds: < 0.77 m/s, indicating an aggravated adverse effect; and > 1.06 m/s, indicating a positive effect. Conclusions: The adverse effect of obesity on dependence in ADL is moderated by gait speed. Considering these thresholds, the distribution of older adults in each of the proposed areas of significance were: below 0.77 (m/s) = 14,324 (70.0%), above 1.06 (m/s) = 1553 older adults (7.5%) and between areas = 4630 older adults (22.5%).",Article,"Ramirez-Velez, R.; Perez-Sousa, M.A.; Venegas-Sanabria, L.C.; Chavarro-Carvajal, D.A.; Cano-Gutierrez, C.A.; Correa-Bautista, J.E.; Gonzalez-Ruiz, K.; Izquierdo, M.",Gait speed; Obesity; Dependence; Latin-American; Elderly,Gait speed;Obesity;Dependence;Latin-American;Elderly;INCIDENT DISABILITY;WALKING SPEED;MORTALITY;STRENGTH;DECLINE;PERFORMANCE;WEIGHT;PEOPLE;HEALTH;RISK,Spain;Colombia,

In low- and median-income countries, national information on the clinical and economic outcomes associated with this surgery does not exist. This study aimed to identify and describe the clinical and economic outcomes for children undergoing appendectomy in Colombia's contributory system and to determine the prognostic factors associated with these outcomes. Methods A retrospective cohort study was conducted using administrative data from patients under 18 years of age who underwent an appendectomy between July 1, 2013, and September 30, 2015, in Colombia's contributory health system. Thirty-day mortality rates, intensive care unit (ICU) admission rates, length of stay (LOS), readmission rates and median costs were estimated for the entire country by geographic region and insurer. The prognostic factors associated with these outcomes were identified using generalized multilevel mixed models. Results A total of 21,674 children were included. The 30-day postoperative mortality rate was 0.06% [95% CI 0.02-0.9], the ICU admission rate was 8.00% [95% CI 7.63-8.36], the mean LOS was 2.48 days (SD 5.24), the readmission rate was 1.5% [95% CI 1.33-1.66] and the median cost for Colombia was 394 USD [p25-p75: 256-555]. The prognostic factors that were associated with the 30-day ICU admission rate, LOS and readmission rate were the insurer, geographic region, age, occurrence of an appendectomy with peritoneal drainage, and certain comorbidities, such as cancer and neurological, respiratory and gastrointestinal illnesses. The prognostic factors associated with costs were those previously mentioned as well as the occurrence of a laparoscopic appendectomy.

For example, by ECG, it is possible to obtain information about cardiac disease, emotions, personal identification, and the sex of a person, among others. This paper proposes the study of the heartbeat from a soft-biometric perspective to be applied to smartphone unlocking services. We employ the user heartbeat to classify the individual by sex (male, female) with the use of Deep Learning, reaching an accuracy of 94.4% +/- 2.0%. This result was obtained with the RGB representation of the union of the time-frequency transformation from the pseudo-orthogonal X, Y, and Z bipolar signals. Evaluating each bipolar contribution, we found that the XYZ combination provides the best category distinction using GoogLeNet. The 24-h Holter database of the study contains 202 subjects with a female size of 49.5%. We propose an architecture for managing this signal that allows the use of a few samples to train the network.

Due to the considerable height of the central nave, the church can experience vertical temperature gradients. In order to investigate this issue, temperatures were recorded between August 2017 and February 2018 from a wireless monitoring system composed of 21 sensor nodes, which were located at different heights in the church from 2 to 13 m from the floor level. For characterizing the temperature at high, medium and low altitude heights, a novel methodology is proposed based on sparse Partial Least Squares regression (sPLS), Linear Discriminant Analysis (LDA), and the Holt-Winters method, among others, which were applied to a time series of temperature. This approach is helpful to discriminate temperature profiles according to sensor height. Once the vertical thermal gradients for each month were characterized, it was found that temperature reached the maximum correlation with sensor height in the period between August 10th and September 9th. Furthermore, the most important features from the time series that explain this correlation are the mean temperature and the mean of moving range. In the period mentioned, the vertical thermal gradient was estimated to be about 0.043 degrees C/m, which implies a difference of 0.47 degrees C on average between sensor nodes at 2 m from the floor with respect to the upper ones located at 13 m from the floor level. The gradient was estimated as the slope from a linear regression model using height and hourly mean temperature as the predictor and response, respectively. This gradient is consistent with similar reported studies. The fact that such gradient was only found in one month suggests that the mechanisms of dust deposition on walls involved in vertical thermal gradients are not important in this case regarding the preventive conservation of artworks. Furthermore, the methodology proposed here was useful to discriminate the time series at high, medium and low altitude levels. This approach can be useful when a set of sensors is installed for microclimate monitoring in churches, cathedrals, and other historical buildings, at different levels and positions.",Article,"Ramirez, S.; Zarzo, M.; Perles, A.; Garcia-Diego, F.J.",autocorrelation; Holt-Winters; LDA; temperature gradient; sPLS; wireless sensors,autocorrelation;Holt-Winters;LDA;temperature gradient;sPLS;wireless sensors;LEAST-SQUARES REGRESSION;SANTA-MARIA;PREVENTIVE CONSERVATION;ARCHAEOLOGICAL SITE;PRINCIPAL COMPONENT;INDOOR MICROCLIMATE;RISK;METHODOLOGY;PARAMETERS;ALTARPIECE,Spain;Colombia,2-s2.0-85117209307;2-s2.0-85117209307;2-s2.0-85117209307;2-s2.0-85117209307;2-s2.0-85117209307

An agent-based model of a pure market economy is designed so that a population of firms interact with one another and with a bank. The model determines the interfirm payment network arising from supplier-customer relationships on the basis of a random graph with uniform attachment mechanisms. The interfirm payment network shapes both the liquidity available to each firm and the debts firms incur to finance these payments. Eventually, firms might not have sufficient liquidity to meet their debt requirements, hence their financial distress. Firms that target higher FCFs must reduce their payments to suppliers for the same amount of payments they expect to receive from customers. This influences the interfirm payment network and, therefore, firms' financial distress. On this basis, computational experiments introduce variations in FCF targets. The lowest FCF targets lead to the lowest levels of financial distress in the business sector.

,,,1,WOS:000562995500001,2021,Firms in financial distress: evidence from inter-firm payment networks with volatility driven by 'animal spirits',"This paper elaborates an agent-based model of a pure market economy to provide theoretical evidence on how volatility-induced changes in inter-firm payment networks affect the financial distress of firms. This volatility is driven by 'animal spirits' in that it arises from the feelings of optimism/pessimism independently of rational decision-making, and influences the liquidity available to each firm through the inter-firm payment network; consequently, some firms may enter financial distress. The model first determines the inter-firm payment network. Then, a mean-reverting square-root process introduces volatility into the inter-firm payment network through firms' propensity to pay suppliers according to the payments that firms expect to receive from customers. The model is calibrated for compatibility with relevant macro- and microeconomic stylized facts. According to computational experiments, financial distress in the business sector is minimized when feelings of optimism/pessimism generate the lowest volatility in firms' propensity to pay suppliers. In addition, this volatility must materialize around an intermediate value of firms' propensity to pay suppliers, and firms must keep this intermediate value over time.",Article,"Stellian, R.; Penagos, G.I.; Danna-Buitrago, J.P.",Financial distress; Inter-firm payment network; Animal spirits; Volatility; Agent-based model; Mean-reverting square-root process,Financial distress;Inter-firm payment network;Animal spirits;Volatility;Agent-based model;Mean-reverting square-root process;MODEL;RISK;MACROECONOMICS;DETERMINANTS;PREDICTION;ECONOMICS;ENSEMBLE;DYNAMICS;MARKET,Colombia,2-s2.0-85081549196;2-s2.0-85081549196

In Colombia, congenital malformations are the second leading cause of infant mortality. Objective: To determine the geographical distribution of extended perinatal mortality due to congenital malformations in Colombia between 1999 and 2008. Materials and methods: We conducted a cross-sectional study. We revised all death certificates issued between 1999 and 2008. We defined perinatal mortality as fetal or non-fetal deaths within the first 28 days after delivery in children with body weight >= 500 grams, and congenital malformations according to ICD-10 diagnostic codes Q000 - Q999. The annual birth projection was used as the denominator. We defined high mortality areas due to congenital malformations as those in the 90th percentile. Results: We recorded 22,361 perinatal deaths due to congenital malformations. The following provinces exceeded the 90th perinatal mortality percentile: Antioquia, Caldas, Risaralda, Huila, Quindio, Bogota, Valle del Cauca and Guainla. Among the municipalities, the highest perinatal mortality rates were found in Giraldo, Ciudad Bolivar, Riosucio, Liborina, Supia, Alejandria, Sopetran, San Jeronimo, Santa Fe de Antioquia and Marmato (205.81 and 74.18 per 10.000 live births). The perinatal mortality rate due to malformations of the circulatory system was 28.1 per 10.000 live births, whereas the rates for central nervous system defects and chromosomal abnormalities were 13.7 and 7.0, respectively. Conclusions: The Andean region showed high perinatal mortality rates due to congenital malformations.

METHODS: An analytical observational study with retrospective data collection was conducted. We reviewed the medical records of all the patients who underwent radical prostatectomy between the years 2012-2014. The analysis of the data included a bivariate model to study the associations between BMI and the surgical procedure, its complications, oncologic outcomes and cancer follow-up. Then, we used multivariate logistic regression analysis to determine if there was an independent association between oncologic outcomes and BMI; the model was adjusted by age, hypertension and diabetes mellitus. RESULTS: 272 patients underwent radical prostatectomy: 98 (36.0%) had normal BMI, 142 (52.2%) were overweight and 32 (11.8%) were obese. The median age was 61 interquartile range (IQR=56-66) years old. There were no statistically significant differences in the preoperative and postoperative outcomes according to BMI. The obese patients had longer operative time (176 minutes, GR=165.0-195.5); nonetheless, the difference was not statistically significant (p=0.18). There were no complications during the procedure (rectal, vascular or obturator nerve injury). The multivariate analysis showed that age, hypertension and diabetes mellitus were not effect modifiers.

Methods Based on age-specific and sex-specific data on colorectal cancer incidence, data from population-based surveys for the exposure data and population projections, the macrosimulation model Prevent V.3.01 was used to model expected colorectal cancer incidence for the period 2016-2050. Baseline models were those where exposure levels were not subject to change because of interventions. Two intervention scenarios were specified: one with elimination of exposure to the risk factor as of 2017 and a second one where over a 10-year period the current prevalence data gradually declined until they reach 90% of the 2016 levels. Results Under the reference scenarios, a total number of 274 637 colorectal cancers would be expected to occur in the period 2016-2050. Under the scenario of 10% gradual decline in the prevalence of alcohol and tobacco consumption, physical inactivity and high body mass index, a total of 618, 488, 2954 and 2086 new cases, respectively, would be avoided. Under scenarios of elimination, these numbers of avoided cases would be 6908 (elimination alcohol), 6104 (elimination tobacco), 16 637 (optimizing physical inactivity) and 25 089 (all on ideal weight).

In Latin America, young people living in deprived urban areas face various risk factors for mental distress. However, most either do not develop mental distress in the form of depression and anxiety, or recover within a year without treatment from mental health services. This research programme seeks to identify the personal and social resources that help young people to prevent and recover from mental distress. Methods and analysis A cross-sectional study will compare personal and social resources used by 1020 young people (aged 15-16 and 20-24 years) with symptoms of depression and/or anxiety and 1020 without. A longitudinal cohort study will follow-up young people with mental distress after 6 months and 1 year and compare resource use in those who do and do not recover. An experience sampling method study will intensively assess activities, experiences and mental distress in subgroups over short time periods. Finally, we will develop case studies highlighting existing initiatives that effectively support young people to prevent and recover from mental distress. The analysis will assess differences between young people with and without distress at baseline using t-tests and chi(2) tests. Within the groups with mental distress, multivariate logistic regression analyses using a random effects model will assess the relationship between predictor variables and recovery.

They play a role in various diseases, including development and progression of breast cancer; the objective of this study was to evaluate the association of common variants in the ductal-epithelium-associated RING chromosome 1 (DEAR1) gene with breast cancer risk in a sample of Colombian population. METHODS: We carried out a case-control study to investigate associations of variants in DEAR1 with breast cancer in women from Colombia. Single nucleotide polymorphisms (SNPs) rs584298, rs2927970, rs59983645, and rs599167 were genotyped in 1022 breast cancer cases and 1023 healthy controls using the iPLEX (R) and Kompetitive Allele Specific PCR ( polymerase chain reaction) (KASP) method. The associations between SNPs and breast cancer were examined by conditional logistic regression. The associations between SNPs and epidemiological/histopathological variables were examined by multinomial logistic regression. RESULTS : Associations were found between tag SNPs and breast cancer adjusted for the epidemiological risk factors rs584298 genotypes AG and GG (P =.048 and P =.004, respectively). The analysis of the disease characteristics showed that SNP rs584298 (genotype AG) (P =.015) shows association with progesterone receptor (PR) status and (genotype AA) (P =.048) shows association with human epidermal growth factor receptor 2 (HER2) status. CONCLUSIONS : The SNP rs584298 in DEAR1 showed associations with breast cancer and the expression of HER2 receptor; when this receptor is amplified, the result is aggressive tumoral subtype and expression of PR receptor that is associated with high-proliferative tumor grade.

BMI or nutritional status trajectories from diagnosis have not yet been well described in dementia, especially in people with Lewy body dementia (LBD); a group that has a poorer prognosis. With this study, we aimed to evaluate the BMI trajectory in people diagnosed with mild LBD and Alzheimer's disease (AD). Methods The Dementia Study of Western Norway is a cohort study with annual assessments. Five-year measurements of BMI from 196 patients (LBD = 85 and AD = 111) diagnosed with mild dementia were analyzed using adjusted linear mixed-effects models. Results There were no differences between LBD and AD in baseline BMI, age, or mini-mental status examination (MMSE). During the follow-up, we observed a significant decrease in BMI in the LBD group across the study period (estimation [Est.]: -0.63, SE: 0.14; p < 0.001). By contrast, there was no significant change in BMI trajectory associated with AD diagnosis (Est.: 0.05, SE: 0.15; p = 0.730). Further, the introduction of an interaction term between diagnosis and time in the study showed that this difference (BMI trajectories) was significant (Est.: -0.63, SE: 0.14; p < 0.001). In addition, there was a significant interaction between MMSE total score and the follow-up time; the lower the MMSE, the lower the BMI (Est.: 0.01, SE: 0.01; p = 0.044). Conclusion In LBD, BMI significantly decreased with disease progression. In addition, low cognitive performance was associated with a reduction in BMI.

The aim of this study was to characterize the anteroposterior center of pressure (COP-AP) in the time and the frequency domains in the T2DM/PDN group in relation to the control group. To that end we: (1) evaluated the efficacy of using both linear and non-linear discrete wavelet transform (DWT) analyses to evaluate oscillation patterns in the anteroposterior center of pressure (COP-AP) in the bipedal position in terms of time and frequency and (2) established input parameters for a model for predicting the risk of falling. This study included an experimental sample of 30 people with T2DM/PDN matched by gender, age, weight and height with a control sample of 30 healthy individuals. Unreported techniques for analyzing the COP-AP literature were assessed for their capacity to model patient bodily stability in the proprioceptive, visual and vestibular systems. To measure COP-AP, five tests were performed under different conditions as outlined in the Romberg Test using the ""PEDAR System"" for measuring plantar pressure. DWTs were used to calculate excursion parameters, average speeds, range, RMS values, the average maximum and minimum amplitude, power spectral densities and energy percentages in 11 frequency bands (D1 to D10 and A10). There were significant differences between the two study groups in terms of the calculated linear parameters (p < 0.05). Using linear and non-linear DWT analyses, a preliminary characterization of COP-AP patterns was achieved. DWT could be used alongside linear analysis to determine the effect changes in these systems have on postural oscillation in people with T2DM.

The utility of multiparametric magnetic resonance imaging (mpMRI) in detecting prostate cancer (PCa) shows promise to be used as triage test for systematic prostate biopsy. Our aim is to Study clinical parameters and oncological outcomes in men with negative mpMRI (nMRI; PI-RADS v2 scores of <= 2) who underwent robot-assisted radical prostatectomy (RARP) to evaluate nMRI's practicality as a biopsy triage test. Methods Retrospective analysis of 331 men with nMRI who underwent RARP between 2014 and 2020 compared with men with positive mpMRI (pMRI; PI-RADS v2 scores >= 3, N = 1770). csPCa was defined as Gleason score >= 3 + 4 and biochemical recurrence (BCR) was defined as PSA > 0.2 ng/ml on two occasions. Biopsies were graded with the International Society of Urologic Pathology [ISUP] grade. Descriptive statistics for nMRI and pMRI were performed. Mann-Whitney U test was used for continuous variables and chi(2) for categorical variables. Univariable and multivariable regression analyses were performed. Results Univariable analysis shows statistically significant difference (p < .05) between median age (nMRI-61 years vs. pMRI 63 years), race (higher incidence of nMRI in African American men), use of 5-alpha reductase inhibitors (higher rate in nMRI). While incidence rates of family history of PCa, suspicious digital rectal examination (DRE) findings, median PSA levels and 4Kscore, were lower in nMRI versus pMRI. Rates of positive surgical margins and BCR were comparable in nMRI versus pMRI. Biopsy ISUP Grades I and II upgraded by 51% and 12%, respectively in final pathology. African American race and no history of the prior negative biopsy were significant predictors for upgrading.

Design and setting: We designed a retrospective, observational cohort study, which included all patients aged between a month and 17 years and 364 days, admitted to the pediatric intensive care unit of a high complexity university hospital between April 1, 2016 and December 31, 2018. We analyzed the standardized mortality ratio, discrimination, calibration, and net reclassification index (NRI) for each model. Results: A total of 722 patients were included, the mortality rate was 3.74%, and for PIM-3, the ratio between expected and observed mortality was 0.66 [confidence interval (CI) 0.40-1.05] for PIM-2 and 1.00 (CI 0.59-1.68) for PIM-3. The Hosmer-Lemeshow (HL) test suggests inadequate calibration for PIM-2 (HL = 13.18, p = 0.11) and adequate calibration for PIM-3 (HL = 28.08, p < 0.01). The area under the diagnostic performance curves for PIM-2 and PIM-3 were 0.87 (95% CI 0.80-0.94) and 0.89 (95% CI 0.82-0.95), respectively. The NRI was -27.1%. PIM-3 classified survivors better than PIM-2, but inadequately classified nonsurvivors.

Since then they have become a device broadly used worldwide with an important commercial activity. Unfortunately, they have an equivalent or even greater risk for multiple harmful health outcomes when compared with conventional cigarettes. Nevertheless, these devices are perceived less harmful or addictive, and are more socially accepted. Additionally, most users belong to the teenage population, which is characterized by greater vulnerability due to the ongoing neurodevelopment process. Objective: Conduct a thematic review of the electronic cigarettes, their regulatory policies, consumption patterns and described associations with mental health. Methodology: A search for secondary studies was conducted in PubMed and SciELO databases using MeSH, DeCS and free terms. Review results were performed according to the aimed topics for evaluation. Finally, 54 articles were obtained after the screening process. Discussion: The influence of nicotine on adolescent brain development is well described, just as their consumption trend and the regulatory measures that have been implemented.

Over the past decade, the treatment of type 2 diabetes mellitus (T2DM) has entirely changed. One of the paradigm changes has been the arrival of new drugs that reduce cardiovascular risk beyond the reduction of A1C. Objective: Sodium-glucose cotransporter 2 (SGLT2i) and glucagon-like peptide-1 receptor agonist (GLP-1RA) are two groups of antidiabetics drugs, which have demonstrated superiority compared to placebo for major cardiovascular events (MACE). Methods: We update and discuss their impact on MACE expressed as relative risk (HR hazard ratio) and as the number needed to treat (NNT) to avoid one cardiovascular event in 5 years. We include the publications of the last 10 years. Results: Empagliflozin, Canagliflozin and Dapagliflozin present an HR for MACE of 0.86, 0.86, 0.86 and an NNT of 38, 44, and 33, respectively (Dapagliflozin in secondary prevention).

Index insurance offers structural advantages compared with conventional insurance, including moral hazard, adverse selection, and systemic risk. It also represents a promising financial tool because of its potential to provide timely economic relief after an unusual weather event by indemnifying policyholders based on the observed value of a particular index directly related to weather parameters. Because of these advantages, this type of insurance can potentially be extended to more crop-productive regions. This study examines the possible spread of weather index insurance programs for Arabica Coffee in Colombia in the short and medium terms in aggregated regions, according to the wet and dry crop seasons. Using a short historical precipitation data from 2010 to 2019 for 163 productive zones in 11 departments located at altitudes of 990-1,890 m, we use an unsupervised technique to first cluster the observations through mixture modeling. Then, we extract through singular spectrum analysis, the signal components of precipitation of each cluster and seasons to propose a simple index insurance model which determines the immediate payoff disbursals. We particularly identify the behavior of the tendency and seasonal payoffs. Finally, we forecast the tendency components in each cluster and season to derive a ratio of future payoffs in exceedance. This ratio serves as a measure of financial risk as it represents future additional payments that are expected to be disbursed due to the tendency component. The results have important implications for designing agricultural hedging instruments for coffee producers at an individual scale or as reinsurance instruments.",Article,"Abrego-Perez, L.A.; Penagos-Londono, G.I.",Index insurance; Singular spectrum analysis (SSA); Payoffs in exceedance; Financial risk measure,Index insurance;Singular spectrum analysis (SSA);Payoffs in exceedance;Financial risk measure;RAINFALL;NUMBER;RISK;CLUSTERS;TREND,Colombia,2-s2.0-85126082217;2-s2.0-85126082217;2-s2.0-85126082217

However, to the best of our knowledge, few studies have evaluated to what extent the presence of chronic and early NPS impacts cognition and functionality in patients with minor or major stages of NCD. Objective: We aimed to assess the interplay between early and chronic NPS and cognitive and functional presentation of patients with mild and major forms of NCD. Methods: We used two NPS tools tracking early and late NPS and assessed to what extent they determine cognitive and functional outcomes in patients with mild and major forms of NCD. Results: We found an inverse relationship between the presence of NPS, as measured by the Neuropsychiatric Inventory and Mild Behavioral Impairment Checklist (MBI-C), and cognitive and functional variables in major forms of NCD. In contrast, the minor stage of NCD was associated with increased MBI-C scores. Conclusion: Our results revealed that NPS are associated with cognitive and functional outcomes in mild and chronic forms of NCD. Crucially our results suggest that NPS could be considered as a pathological marker of the clinical course of dementia.

Drinking frequency, and level (moderate or heavy drinking) were used to assess alcohol use and depressive symptoms explored with the 15 items-GDS., using bivariate and multivariate adjusted regression models.Results: Lower weekly drinking frequency and a higher number of drinks per serving were associated with total GDS score. For individual symptoms, higher drinking frequency was associated with dropping activities and a preference to stay at home. Lower drinking frequency was associated with low mood, unhappiness, feelings of emptiness, worthlessness, hopelessness, and a lack of vigour. Lower number of drinks per serving was associated with withdrawal/apathy related symptoms; these also related to higher frequency of weekly alcohol consumption. Higher number of drinks per serving was associated with feelings of emptiness, worthlessness, boredom, help-lessness, worthlessness. not wanting to be alive, thinking that other people are better off in their mood, being afraid that something bad will happen and subjective memory problems.

Moreover, patient suicidal ideation at hospitalization is predictive of reported caregiver suicidal ideation at later time points. Clinicians and rehabilitation specialists may wish to expanding practices of assessing suicide risk in patients to include caregivers, particularly caregivers of patients who endorsed suicidal ideation. Given that these findings demonstrate significant interdependence of suicidality between patients and caregivers, interventions for patients with TBI should include their respective caregivers or even incorporate family systems theories and approaches. Purpose/Objective: Traumatic brain injury (TBI) is associated with depression, anxiety, and even suicidality in individuals with TBI and in caregivers. Moreover, emotional functioning in individuals with TBI is linked with caregiver functioning. However, no known studies to date have examined linkages in suicidal ideation in individuals with TBI and family caregivers. This is especially important in Latin America, where TBI rates are high, and where cultural norms influence family caregiving. This study examined associations among self-reported suicidal ideation in individuals with TBI and their primary caregivers over time in Mexico and Colombia. Research Method/Design: A total of 109 individuals and their primary caregivers completed measures during hospitalization for TBI and at 2- and 4-months posthospitalization. The primary outcome was Item 9 from the Spanish version of the Patient Health Questionnaire-9, assessing for thoughts of death or suicide in the previous 2 weeks. Results: Patients and caregivers reported high levels of suicidal ideation (18.3%-22.4% and 12.4%-15.7%, respectively) at each time point, and suicidal ideation at one time point strongly predicted ideation at the next. When patients endorsed suicidal ideation in the hospital, their caregivers tended to endorse suicidal ideation 2 months later. Although unaccounted for variables could be driving these relationships, they may also provide possible evidence of causal preponderance between patient and caregiver suicidal ideation post-TBI. Conclusions/Implications: Clinicians and rehabilitation specialists can use these findings to inform suicide risk assessment by expanding these practices to caregivers of patients who endorsed suicidal ideation. Interventions after TBI should incorporate caregivers given this study showed significant interdependence of suicidality between patients and caregivers.",Article,"McKee, G.B.; Perrin, P.B.; Rodriguez-Agudelo, Y.; Plaza, S.L.O.; Quijano-Martinez, M.C.; Kuzu, D.; Ohayagha, C.; Pugh, M.; Arango-Lasprilla, J.C.",TBI; suicidal ideation; family caregivers; Latin America,TBI;suicidal ideation;family caregivers;Latin America;FAMILY CARERS;HEAD-INJURY;DEPRESSION;PEOPLE;BURDEN;RISK;DISORDERS;PREDICTORS;DEMENTIA;CONTEXT,United States;Mexico;Colombia;Turkey;Spain,2-s2.0-85119270540;2-s2.0-85119270540;2-s2.0-85119270540

Many clinical trials in the last 20 years have taken into account the percentage of stenosis as a parameter to stage the degree of risk of the patient. With the advances that have been made in imaging techniques such as ultrasound, CT Angiography and Carotid MR for vascular assessment, it is now possible to stage patients, not only based on the percentage of stenosis, but also for vulnerability or instability to be able to undergo a rupture of the plaque and that produces a cerebral vascular event of ischemic type. These imaging techniques are ushering in a change in the way of evaluating the carotid plaque that allows risk staging based on the characteristics of the image such as Intraplaque Hemorrhage (IPH), plaque ulceration, thickness of the fibrous layer, neovascularization of the plaque and the presence of Lipid Rich Necrotic Center in Lipids (LRNC).

,,,313,WOS:000423460900001,2016,Measuring the health-related Sustainable Development Goals in 188 countries: a baseline analysis from the Global Burden of Disease Study 2015,"Background In September, 2015, the UN General Assembly established the Sustainable Development Goals (SDGs). The SDGs specify 17 universal goals, 169 targets, and 230 indicators leading up to 2030. We provide an analysis of 33 health-related SDG indicators based on the Global Burden of Diseases, Injuries, and Risk Factors Study 2015 (GBD 2015). Methods We applied statistical methods to systematically compiled data to estimate the performance of 33 health-related SDG indicators for 188 countries from 1990 to 2015. We rescaled each indicator on a scale from 0 (worst observed value between 1990 and 2015) to 100 (best observed). Indices representing all 33 health-related SDG indicators (health-related SDG index), health-related SDG indicators included in the Millennium Development Goals (MDG index), and health-related indicators not included in the MDGs (non-MDG index) were computed as the geometric mean of the rescaled indicators by SDG target. We used spline regressions to examine the relations between the Socio-demographic Index (SDI, a summary measure based on average income per person, educational attainment, and total fertility rate) and each of the health-related SDG indicators and indices. Findings In 2015, the median health-related SDG index was 59.3 (95% uncertainty interval 56.8-61.8) and varied widely by country, ranging from 85.5 (84.2-86.5) in Iceland to 20.4 (15.4-24.9) in Central African Republic. SDI was a good predictor of the health-related SDG index (r(2) = 0.88) and the MDG index (r(2) = 0.92), whereas the non-MDG index had a weaker relation with SDI (r(2) = 0.79). Between 2000 and 2015, the health-related SDG index improved by a median of 7.9 (IQR 5.0-10.4), and gains on the MDG index (a median change of 10.0 [6.7-13.1]) exceeded that of the nonMDG index (a median change of 5.5 [2.1-8.9]). Since 2000, pronounced progress occurred for indicators such as met need with modern contraception, under-5 mortality, and neonatal mortality, as well as the indicator for universal health coverage tracer interventions. Moderate improvements were found for indicators such as HIV and tuberculosis incidence, minimal changes for hepatitis B incidence took place, and childhood overweight considerably worsened. Interpretation GBD provides an independent, comparable avenue for monitoring progress towards the health-related SDGs. Our analysis not only highlights the importance of income, education, and fertility as drivers of health improvement but also emphasises that investments in these areas alone will not be sufficient. Although considerable progress on the health-related MDG indicators has been made, these gains will need to be sustained and, in many cases, accelerated to achieve the ambitious SDG targets. The minimal improvement in or worsening of health-related indicators beyond the MDGs highlight the need for additional resources to effectively address the expanded scope of the health-related SDGs.",Article,"Lim, S.S.;

,,,301,WOS:000695130500023,2021,Worldwide trends in hypertension prevalence and progress in treatment and control from 1990 to 2019: a pooled analysis of 1201 population-representative studies with 104 million participants,"Background Hypertension can be detected at the primary health-care level and low-cost treatments can effectively control hypertension. We aimed to measure the prevalence of hypertension and progress in its detection, treatment, and control from 1990 to 2019 for 200 countries and territories. Methods We used data from 1990 to 2019 on people aged 30-79 years from population-representative studies with measurement of blood pressure and data on blood pressure treatment. We defined hypertension as having systolic blood pressure 140 mm Hg or greater, diastolic blood pressure 90 mm Hg or greater, or taking medication for hypertension. We applied a Bayesian hierarchical model to estimate the prevalence of hypertension and the proportion of people with hypertension who had a previous diagnosis (detection), who were taking medication for hypertension (treatment), and whose hypertension was controlled to below 140/90 mm Hg (control). The model allowed for trends over time to be non-linear and to vary by age. Findings The number of people aged 30-79 years with hypertension doubled from 1990 to 2019, from 331 (95% credible interval 306-359) million women and 317 (292-344) million men in 1990 to 626 (584-668) million women and 652 (604-698) million men in 2019, despite stable global age-standardised prevalence. In 2019, age-standardised hypertension prevalence was lowest in Canada and Peru for both men and women; in Taiwan, South Korea, Japan, and some countries in western Europe including Switzerland, Spain, and the UK for women; and in several low-income and middle-income countries such as Eritrea, Bangladesh, Ethiopia, and Solomon Islands for men. Hypertension prevalence surpassed 50% for women in two countries and men in nine countries, in central and eastern Europe, central Asia, Oceania, and Latin America. Globally, 59% (55-62) of women and 49% (46-52) of men with hypertension reported a previous diagnosis of hypertension in 2019, and 47% (43-51) of women and 38% (35-41) of men were treated. Control rates among people with hypertension in 2019 were 23% (20-27) for women and 18% (16-21) for men. In 2019, treatment and control rates were highest in South Korea, Canada, and Iceland (treatment >70%; control >50%), followed by the USA, Costa Rica, Germany, Portugal, and Taiwan. Treatment rates were less than 25% for women and less than 20% for men in Nepal, Indonesia, and some countries in sub-Saharan Africa and Oceania. Control rates were below 10% for women and men in these countries and for men in some countries in north Africa, central and south Asia, and eastern Europe. Treatment and control rates have improved in most countries since 1990, but we found little change in most countries in sub-Saharan Africa and Oceania. Improvements were largest in high-income countries, central Europe, and some upper-middle-income and recently high-income countries including Costa Rica, Taiwan, Kazakhstan, South Africa, Brazil, Chile, Turkey, and Iran. Interpretation Improvements in the detection, treatment, and control of hypertension have varied substantially across countries, with some middle-income countries now outperforming most high-income nations. The dual approach of reducing hypertension prevalence through primary prevention and enhancing its treatment and control is achievable not only in high-income countries but also in low-income and middle-income settings.

It is motivated by the need to identify application areas, trends, architectures and open challenges in these two fields. The underlying survey was developed following a systematic literature review using academic documents written in English and published in peer-reviewed venues from 2006 to 2016. Selected references were clustered into four application domains corresponding to: monitoring, control, logistics, and prediction. Implementation-specific details from each selected reference were compiled to create usage distributions of sensors, actuators, power sources, edge computing modules, communication technologies, storage solutions, and visualization strategies. Finally, the results from the review were compiled into an IoT architecture that represents a wide range of current solutions in agro-industrial and environmental fields. (C) 2017 Elsevier B.V.

Lack of rigorous scrutiny can lead to undesirable outcomes in ecosystem management, environmental law, and policy. Contrary to the contentions of its proponents, no explicit, irreversible ecological thresholds allow distinctions between 'novel ecosystems' and 'hybrid' or 'historic' ones. Further, there is no clear message as to what practitioners should do with a 'novel ecosystem'. In addition, ecosystems of many types are being conserved, or restored to trajectories within historical ranges of variation, despite severe degradation that could have led to their being pronounced 'novel'.",Article,"Murcia, C.; Aronson, J.; Kattan, G.H.; Moreno-Mateos, D.; Dixon, K.; Simberloff, D.",ecological restoration; novel ecosystems; ecological thresholds; global change,ecological restoration;novel ecosystems;ecological thresholds;global change;CONSERVATION;BIODIVERSITY;RESTORATION;MANAGEMENT;FUTURE;MODEL,United States;France;Colombia;Australia,2-s2.0-84908030971

Analyzing and reconstructing those historical patterns helps to advance the understanding of the dynamics and persistence of present-day ecosystems. This article explores this reconstruction by identifying and analyzing historic drivers of landscape change for seven periods between 1500 and 2000, and presents historical land use maps showing major trends and impacts on natural ecosystems. Historic land use maps were built using an ecosystem map of 1998 and a ""preclearing"" ecosystem map, by constraining the spatial change of transformed areas using data on accessibility to rivers and roads, elevation, slope, moisture availability, and settlement areas. We estimate the transformed area rose from approximately 15 Mha in 1500 to 42 Mha in 2000, and land use changed from cropping in 1500 to predominantly grazing in 2000. Demographic impacts of colonization and the introduction of cattle were major drivers of change, but rates and trends of land cover change varied between regions and from period to period. The most impacted ecosystems have been the Andean and tropical dry forests, with the most recent trends toward clearing of humid lowland forests, especially in the Amazon and Pacific. Some landscapes have been subject to strong human influence continuously for more than 500 years, whereas others have been transformed for less than thirty years. We discuss the relevance of a historical approach for guiding conservation goals, ecological restoration efforts, and research hypotheses.

Tramadol is increasingly used for the treatment of osteoarthritis (OA) because it does not produce gastrointestinal bleeding or renal problems and does not affect articular cartilage. We sought to determine the analgesic effectiveness, the effect on physical function, the duration of benefit, and the safety of oral tramadol in people with OA. Methods. We searched the Cochrane Central Register of Controlled Trials (Central), Medline, Embase, and Lilacs databases up to August 2005. We included randomized controlled trials (RCT) that evaluated the effect of tramadol or tramadol plus paracetamol on pain levels and/or physical function. No language restriction was applied. Results. We included 11 RCT with a total of 1019 participants who received tramadol or tramadol/paracetamol and 920 participants who received placebo or active control. Participants who received tramadol reported (1) less pain [-8.5 units on a 0-100 scale; (95% CI -12.0 to -5.0)], a 12% relative decrease in pain intensity; (2) higher degree of global improvement: one of every 6 individuals taking tramadol or tramadol/paracetamol exhibited at least moderate global improvement (95% CI 4 to 9): and (3) improvement in stiffness and function, an 8.5% relative improvement in Western Ontario and McMaster University Osteoarthritis Index score, than patients who received placebo. In terms of adverse events, one of every 5 participants who received tramadol or tramadol/paracetamol experienced minor adverse events and one of every eight stopped taking the medication because of adverse events (95% CI 7 to 12) compared to participants who received placebo.

Familial hypercholesterolemia affects 1 in 200 to 250 people around the world of every race and ethnicity. The lack of general awareness of FH among the public and medical community has resulted in only 10% of the FH population being diagnosed and adequately treated. The World Health Organization recognized FH as a public health priority in 1998 during a consultation meeting in Geneva, Switzerland. The World Health Organization report highlighted 11 recommendations to address FH worldwide, from diagnosis and treatment to family screening and education. Research since the 1998 report has increased understanding and awareness of FH, particularly in specialty areas, such as cardiology and lipidology. However, in the past 20 years, there has been little progress in implementing the 11 recommendations to prevent premature atherosclerotic cardiovascular disease in an entire generation of families with FH. ObservationsIn 2018, the Familial Hypercholesterolemia Foundation and the World Heart Federation convened the international FH community to update the 11 recommendations. Two meetings were held: one at the 2018 FH Foundation Global Summit and the other during the 2018 World Congress of Cardiology and Cardiovascular Health. Each meeting served as a platform for the FH community to examine the original recommendations, assess the gaps, and provide commentary on the revised recommendations. The Global Call to Action on Familial Hypercholesterolemia thus represents individuals with FH, advocacy leaders, scientific experts, policy makers, and the original authors of the 1998 World Health Organization report. Attendees from 40 countries brought perspectives on FH from low-, middle-, and high-income regions. Tables listing country-specific government support for FH care, existing country-specific and international FH scientific statements and guidelines, country-specific and international FH registries, and known FH advocacy organizations around the world were created. Conclusions and RelevanceBy adopting the 9 updated public policy recommendations created for this document, covering awareness; advocacy; screening, testing, and diagnosis; treatment; family-based care; registries; research; and cost and value, individual countries have the opportunity to prevent atherosclerotic heart disease in their citizens carrying a gene associated with FH and, likely, all those with severe hypercholesterolemia as well. This guideline presents updated recommendations for management of familial hypercholesterolemia. (c) 2020 American Medical Association.

The rapid urbanization and motorization in megacities have a direct impact on sustainable development. Hence, it is very frequently to find the multiple actors from both private and public sectors involved in the design and operation of urban passenger transportation systems to make decisions that seek at optimizing their own particular objectives. However, urban passenger transport system is a very complex task involving multiple criteria related to economic, environmental and socio-political issues. Multi-criteria decision-making (MCDM) techniques actually aid the decision making process by assessing such problems. This paper presents a review of research papers published between 1982 and 2014 (up to May) concerning MCDM for the design and operation of urban passenger transport systems.

We aimed to compare the efficacy, tolerability, and safety of insulin glargine and sitagliptin, a DPP-4 inhibitor, in patients whose disease was uncontrolled with metformin. Methods In this comparative, parallel, randomised, open-label trial, metformin-treated people aged 35-70 years with glycated haemoglobin A(1c) (HbA(1c)) of 7-11%, diagnosis of type 2 diabetes for at least 6 months, and body-mass index of 25-45 kg/m(2) were recruited from 17 countries. Participants were randomly assigned (1:1) to 24-week treatment with insulin glargine (titrated from an initial subcutaneous dose of 0.2 units per kg bodyweight to attain fasting plasma glucose of 4.0-5.5 mmol/L) or sitagliptin (oral dose of 100 mg daily). Randomisation (via a central interactive voice response system) was by random sequence generation and was stratified by centre. Patients and investigators were not masked to treatment assignment. The primary outcome was change in HbA(1c) from baseline to study end. Efficacy analysis included all randomly assigned participants who had received at least one dose of study drug and had at least one on-treatment assessment of any primary or secondary efficacy variable. This trial is registered at ClinicalTrials.gov, NCT00751114. Findings 732 people were screened and 515 were randomly assigned to insulin glargine (n=250) or sitagliptin (n=265). At study end, adjusted mean reduction in HbA(1c) was greater for patients on insulin glargine (n=227; -1.72%, SE 0.06) than for those on sitagliptin (n=253; -1.13%, SE 0.06) with a mean difference of -0.59% (95% CI -0.77 to -0.42, p<0.0001). The estimated rate of all symptomatic hypoglycaemic episodes was greater with insulin glargine than with sitagliptin (4.21 [SE 0.54] vs 0.50 [SE 0.09] events per patient-year; p<0.0001). Severe hypoglycaemia occurred in only three (1%) patients on insulin glargine and one (<1%) on sitagliptin. 15 (6%) of patients on insulin glargine versus eight (3%) on sitagliptin had at least one serious treatment-emergent adverse event.

Maintaining agricultural growth while minimizing climate shocks is crucial to building a resilient food production system and meeting developmental goals in vulnerable countries. Experts have proposed several technological, institutional, and policy interventions to help farmers adapt to current and future weather variability and to mitigate greenhouse gas (GHG) emissions. This paper presents the climate-smart village (CSV) approach as a means of performing agricultural research for development that robustly tests technological and institutional options for dealing with climatic variability and climate change in agriculture using participatory methods. It aims to scale up and scale out the appropriate options and draw out lessons for policy makers from local to global levels. The approach incorporates evaluation of climate-smart technologies, practices, services, and processes relevant to local climatic risk management and identifies opportunities for maximizing adaptation gains from synergies across different interventions and recognizing potential maladaptation and trade-offs. It ensures that these are aligned with local knowledge and link into development plans. This paper describes early results in Asia, Africa, and Latin America to illustrate different examples of the CSV approach in diverse agroecological settings. Results from initial studies indicate that the CSV approach has a high potential for scaling out promising climate-smart agricultural technologies, practices, and services. Climate analog studies indicate that the lessons learned at the CSV sites would be relevant to adaptation planning in a large part of global agricultural land even under scenarios of climate change.

We sought to explore attitudes and practices among healthcare professionals that may contribute to suboptimal glycaemic control through a review of recent relevant publications in the scientific literature. Methods: An electronic search of the PubMed database was performed to identify relevant publications from January 2011 to July 2015. The electronic search was complemented by a manual search of abstracts from key diabetes conferences in 2014/2015 available online. Results: Recently published data indicate that glycaemic control is suboptimal in a substantial proportion (typically 40%-60%) of people with diabetes. This is the case across geographic regions and in both low- and higher-income countries. Therapeutic inertia appears to be an important contributor to poor glycaemic control in up to half of people with type 2 diabetes. In particular, prescribers are often willing to tolerate extended periods of mild' hyperglycaemia as well as having low expectations for their patients. There are often delays of 3years or longer in initiating or intensifying glucose-lowering therapy when needed. Conclusion: Many people with type 2 diabetes are failed by current management, with approximately half not achieving or maintaining appropriate target blood glucose levels, leaving these patients at increased and avoidable risk of serious complications.

This article aims to provide an overview of a process for systematically incorporating values and preferences in guideline development. Methods: In 2013 and 2014, we followed the Grading of Recommendations Assessment, Development and Evaluation (GRADE) approach to adopt, adapt and develop 226 recommendations in 22 guidelines for the Ministry of Health of the Kingdom of Saudi Arabia. To collect context-specific values and preferences for each recommendation, we performed systematic reviews, asked clinical experts to provide feedback according to their clinical experience, and consulted patient representatives. Results: We found several types of studies addressing the importance of outcomes, including those reporting utilities, non-utility measures of health states based on structured questionnaires or scales, and qualitative studies. Guideline panels used the relative importance of outcomes based on values and preferences to weigh the balance of desirable and undesirable consequences of alternative intervention options. However, we found few studies addressing local values and preferences. Conclusions: Currently there are different but no firmly established processes for integrating patient values and preferences in healthcare decision-making of practice guideline development. With GRADE Evidence-to-Decision (EtD) frameworks, we provide an empirical strategy to find and incorporate values and preferences in guidelines by performing systematic reviews and eliciting information from guideline panel members and patient representatives.

Methods We conducted inductive analysis of semi-structured interviews with key informants from a purposive sample of 23 national and international funding agencies that fund health research in Brazil, Colombia, India, the Philippines, South Africa and Thailand. We also surveyed web sites. Findings We found a commitment to knowledge translation in the mandate of 18 of 23 agencies. However, there was a lack of common terminology. Most of the activities were traditional efforts to disseminate to a broad audience, for example using web sites and publications, In addition, more than half (13 of 23) of the agencies encouraged linkage/exchange between researchers and potential users, and 6 of 23 agencies described ""pull"" activities to-generate interest in research from decision-makers. One-third (9 of 23) of funding agencies described a mandate to enhance health equity through improving knowledge translation. Only 3 of 23 agencies were able to describe evaluation of knowledge translation activities. Furthermore, we found national funding agencies made greater knowledge translation efforts when compared to international agencies. Conclusion Funding agencies are engaged in a wide range of creative knowledge translation activities. They might consider their role as knowledge brokers, with an ability to promote research syntheses and a focus on health equity.

Acute bronchiolitis is the leading cause of medical emergencies during winter in children younger than two years of age. Chest physiotherapy is thought to assist infants in the clearance of secretions and to decrease ventilatory effort. Objectives The main objective was to determine the efficacy of chest physiotherapy in infants aged less than 24 months old with acute bronchiolitis. A secondary objective was to determine the efficacy of different techniques of chest physiotherapy (for example, vibration and percussion and passive forced exhalation). Search methods We searched the Cochrane Central Register of Controlled Trials (CENTRAL) (The Cochrane Library 2011, Issue 4) which contains the Cochrane Acute Respiratory Infections Group's Specialised Register, MEDLINE (1966 to November week 3, 2011), MEDLINE in-process and other non-indexed citations (8 December 2011), EMBASE.com (1990 to December 2011), CINAHL (1982 to December 2011), LILACS (1985 to December 2011) and Web of Science (1985 to December 2011). Selection criteria Randomised controlled trials (RCTs) in which chest physiotherapy was compared against no intervention or against another type of physiotherapy in bronchiolitis patients younger than 24 months of age. Data collection and analysis Two review authors independently extracted data. Primary outcomes were respiratory parameters and improvement in severity of disease. Secondary outcomes were length of hospital stay, duration of oxygen supplementation and the use of bronchodilators and steroids. No pooling of data was possible. Main results Nine clinical trials including 891 participants were included comparing physiotherapy with no intervention. Five trials (246 participants) evaluated vibration and percussion techniques and four trials (645 participants) evaluated passive expiratory techniques. We observed no significant differences in the severity of disease (eight trials, 867 participants). Results were negative for both types of physiotherapy. We observed no differences between groups in respiratory parameters (two trials, 118 participants), oxygen requirements (one trial, 50 participants), length of stay (five trials, 222 participants) or severe side effects (two trials, 595 participants). Differences in mild transient adverse effects (vomiting and respiratory instability) have been observed (one trial, 496 participants). Authors' conclusions Since the last publication of this review new good-quality evidence has appeared, strengthening the conclusions of the review. Chest physiotherapy does not improve the severity of the disease, respiratory parameters, or reduce length of hospital stay or oxygen requirements in hospitalised infants with acute bronchiolitis not on mechanical ventilation. Chest physiotherapy modalities (vibration and percussion or forced expiratory techniques) have shown equally negative results.",Review,"Figuls, M.R.I.; Gine-Garriga, M.; Rugeles, C.G.; Perrotta, C.","Acute Disease; Bronchiolitis [therapy]; Drainage, Postural; Infant, Newborn; Oxygen Inhalation Therapy; Percussion [methods]; Randomized Controlled Trials as Topic; Respiratory Therapy [methods]; Vibration [therapeutic use]; Humans; Infant","Acute Disease;Bronchiolitis [therapy];Drainage, Postural;Infant, Newborn;Oxygen Inhalation Therapy;Percussion [methods];Randomized Controlled Trials as Topic;Respiratory Therapy [methods];Vibration [therapeutic use];Humans;Infant;RESPIRATORY SYNCYTIAL VIRUS;CONSENSUS CONFERENCE;RISK-FACTORS;INFANTS;MANAGEMENT;CHILDREN;GUIDELINES;DEATHS;IMPACT;CARE",Spain;Colombia;Ireland,WOS:000373285000014

Yet, there is lack of comparative efficacy of interventions that seem to be better than placebo among which, the clinicians must choose. Our aim was to determine the comparative effectiveness and safety of the pharmacological and nutritional interventions for reducing the duration of ADG in children. Methods Data sources included Medline, Embase, CENTRAL, CINAHL, LILACS, and Global-Health up to May 2017. Eligible trials compared zinc (ZN), vitamin A, micronutrients (MN), probiotics, prebiotics, symbiotics, racecadotril, smectite(SM), loperamide, diluted milk, lactose-free formula(LCF), or their combinations, to placebo or standard treatment (STND), or among them. Two reviewers independently performed screening, review, study selection and extraction. The primary outcome was diarrhea duration. Secondary outcomes were stool frequency at day 2, diarrhea at day 3, vomiting and side effects. We performed a random effects Bayesian network meta-analysis to combine the direct and indirect evidence for each outcome. Mean differences and odds ratio with their credible intervals(CrI) were calculated. Coherence and transitivity assumptions were assessed. Meta-regression, subgroups and sensitivity analyses were conducted to explore the impact of effect modifiers. Summary under the cumulative curve (SUCRA) values with their CrI were calculated. We assessed the evidence quality and classified the best interventions using the Grading of Recommendations, Assessment, Development & Evaluation (GRADE) approach for each paired comparison. Results A total of 174 studies (32,430 children) proved eligible. Studies were conducted in 42 countries of which most were low-and middle-income countries (LMIC). Interventions were grouped in 27 categories. Most interventions were better than STND. Reduction of diarrhea varied from 12.5 to 51.1 hours. The combinations Saccharomyces boulardii (SB)+ZN, and SM+ZN were considered the best interventions (i.e., GRADE quality of evidence: moderate to high, substantial superiority to STND, reduction in duration of 35 to 40 hours, and large SUCRA values), while symbiotics (combination of probiotics+prebiotics), ZN, loperamide and combinations ZN+MN and ZN+LCF were considered inferior to the best and better than STND [Quality: moderate to high, superior to STND, and reduction of 17 to 25 hours]. In subgroups analyses, effect of ZN was higher in LMIC and was not present in high-income countries (HIC). Vitamin A, MN, prebiotics, kaolin-pectin, and diluted milk were similar to STND [Quality: moderate to high]. The remainder of the interventions had low to very-low evidence quality. Loperamide was the only intervention with more side effects than STND [Quality: moderate]. Discussion/Conclusion Most interventions analyzed (except vitamin A, micronutrients, prebiotics, and kaolin-pectin) showed evidence of superiority to placebo in reducing the diarrhea. With moderate-to high-quality of evidence, SB+ZN and SM+ZN, demonstrated the best combination of evidence quality and magnitude of effect while symbiotics, loperamide and zinc proved being the best single interventions, and loperamide was the most unsafe. Nonetheless, the effect of zinc, SB+ZN and SM+ZN might only be applied to children in LMIC. Results suggest no further role for studies comparing interventions against no treatment or placebo, or studies testing loperamide, MN, kaolin-pectin, vitamin A, prebiotics and diluted milk.",Review,"Florez, I.D.; Veroniki, A.A.; Al Khalifah, R.; Yepes-Nunez, J.J.; Sierra, J.M.; Vernooij, R.W.M.; Acosta-Reyes, J.; Granados, C.M.; Perez-Gaxiola, G.; Cuello-Garcia, C.; Zea, A.M.; Zhang, Y.; Foroutan, N.; Guyatt, G.H.; Thabane, L.",,ACUTE INFECTIOUS DIARRHEA;EVIDENCE-BASED GUIDELINES;ZINC SUPPLEMENTATION;COST-EFFECTIVENESS;EUROPEAN-SOCIETY;MANAGEMENT;DISEASES;THERAPY;INCONSISTENCY;CONSISTENCY,Canada;Colombia;Greece;Saudi Arabia;Spain;Netherlands;Mexico,2-s2.0-85057955347
,,,39,WOS:000368951200007,2016,Effect of the conversion of conventional pasture to intensive silvopastoral systems on edaphic bacterial and ammonia oxidizer communities in Colombia,"Colombia, as well as many tropical countries, has experienced severe deforestation in the last decades, and millions of acres of native forest areas (F) have been replaced by conventional monoculture pastures (CP), contributing to ecological and soil degradation. In response, multi-canopy intensive silvopastoral systems (ISS), which includes herbs, shrubs and trees, have been developed to provide local fodder sources for livestock while reducing the need for external inputs with a goal to conserve landscapes and improve soil quality. However, there is limited information on the temporal responsiveness of ISS to deliver ecosystem services as reflected in soil microbial properties. Therefore, the objective of this study was to examine the shifts of total and ammonia-oxidizing bacteria (AOB) communities along an ISS chronosequence (ranging from 3 to 15 years since establishment), in comparison to CP and native F and investigate P. juliflora trees as a resource island relative to soil microbial properties. Denaturing gradient gel electrophoresis (DGGE) fingerprints of 16S rRNA gene (total bacteria) as well as amoA gene (ammonia-oxidizing bacteria) (AOB) indicated that soil bacterial communities varied between the land uses, with higher similarities between F and ISS communities, in comparison to CP. The abundance and nitrification potential of ammonia oxidizers were significantly higher in CP and lower in F. In addition, the bacterial communities across ISS chronosequence were more similar between older (ISS-12) and intermediate (ISS-8) systems in comparison with youngest systems (ISS-3). Finally, the canopy of P. juliflora tree did not have an impact on structure of total bacterial community; though, it did have an effect on the structure of AOB communities. Our study suggests that ISS might restore some of the ecosystem services offered by soil microbial communities.

Counter-factual models to estimate the baselines are vulnerable for gaming. In this paper, a novel demand response contract between a user and an aggregator is developed to induce individual rationality (voluntary participation) and asymptotic incentive-compatibility (truthfulness) through the probability of call, which is the chance of a consumer to be selected by the aggregator to serve as demand response resource at a given period. In this approach, a consumer self-reports his baseline and reduction capacity, given a payment scheme that includes cost of electricity, incentive price, and penalty caused by any deviation between self-reported and actual energy consumption. Another important feature of this approach, different from the classic solutions, is that a participant agent does not require reporting marginal utility (energy preference), and only announces information in terms of energy. A two-stage stochastic programming problem is proposed from the demand side to understand the consumer rational decisions under this contract. As result, the aggregator decides randomly what users are called to perform the energy reduction in order to manage the truth-telling behavior of each agent through the probability of call. Mathematical proofs and numerical studies are provided to demonstrate the properties and advantages of this contract in limiting gaming opportunities and in terms of its implementation.",Article,"Vuelvas, J.; Ruiz, F.; Gruosso, G.",Incentive-based demand response; Contract theory; Mechanism design; Probability of call; Baseline,Incentive-based demand response;Contract theory;Mechanism design;Probability of call;Baseline;MANAGEMENT;LOADS,Colombia;Italy,2-s2.0-85047437606;2-s2.0-85047437606;2-s2.0-85047437606

These systems are potentially useful to offer energetic services required by the System Operator (SO) through demand response, considering the spread use of these hydraulic devices in high-rise buildings. In this article, a dynamic model for a WBPS is developed in order to evaluate it as a flexible load for demand response applications. The model is built from first-principles and tuned with experimental data of air pressure, power consumption and water flow, obtaining an error of 1.11% in the energy demand between the experimental and the simulated data. It is shown that the WBPS can operate as a flexible load by changing the pressure set point. Additionally, it is achieved a flexibility of 27% in the energy power consumption without stopping the water flow in the building and it is shown that WBPS can provide Spinning Reserve Services. Finally, this work proposes an aggregator of systems, based on a Proportional-Integral Gain Scheduling controller, that can track the SO requirements with an error lower than 0.86%.

Shorelines are obtained after applying an Artificial Neural Network (ANN) to daily raw video images. The data comprise directional hydrodynamic conditions propagated from deep water to 10 m depth and video-derived daily shorelines over the span of one year and a half. The spatial and temporal variability of the beach is split by Empirical Orthogonal Function (EOF) decomposition. Time-series exploration between EOF and wave height shows a decoupling in spatial shoreline response to wave climate with a more immediate effect in cross-shore sediment transport than in alongshore sediment transport. The first EOF which accounts for the cross-shore variability is significantly correlated with wave height averaged for the previous four days, while the second EOF which explains the alongshore beach variability correlates with the averaged waves of the previous 7 days.

In situations where agricultural expansion is inevitable, it is important to manage intact landscape transformation so that impacts on environmental values are minimised. Here, we present a novel, spatially explicit, land use planning framework that addresses the decision making needed to account for different, competing economic-environment objectives (agricultural production value, biodiversity conservation, ecosystem service retention) when land use change is inevitable within an intact landscape. We apply our framework to the globally significant savannahs of the Orinoquia (Colombia), which in a post-conflict era is under increased agricultural development pressure. We show that while negative environmental impacts can be reduced through planning, the total area of land converted to agriculture is the unavoidable principal driver of biodiversity and ecosystem service loss. We therefore identify planning solutions that perform well across all objectives simultaneously, despite trade-offs among them. When 15%, 20%, 30% and 40% of the study area is allowed to be converted to agriculture, on average planning can improve species persistence and ecosystem service retention by up to 16%, 15%, 12%, and 9%, respectively, when compared to agricultural-focused solutions. Development in the region so far has had an unnecessarily large impact on environmental objectives due to a lack of effective land use planning, creating an 'opportunity debt'. Our study provides an evidence base to inform proactive planning and the development of environmentally sensible agricultural development policy and practice in the region. This framework can be used by stakeholders to achieve agriculture expansion goals and maximise economic profit while minimising impacts on the environment in the Orinoquia, or any relatively intact region that is being developed.",Article,"Williams, B.A.; Grantham, H.S.; Watson, J.E.M.; Alvarez, S.J.; Simmonds, J.S.; Rogeliz, C.A.; Da Silva, M.; Forero-Medina, G.; Etter, A.; Nogales, J.; Walschburger, T.; Hyman, G.; Beyer, H.L.",land use planning; trade-offs; multiple objectives; conservation; ecosystem services; biodiversity; agricultural development,land use planning;trade-offs;multiple objectives;conservation;ecosystem services;biodiversity;agricultural development;LAND-USE;IMPACTS;COLOMBIA;MANAGEMENT;GAINS;MODEL,Australia;United States;Colombia,2-s2.0-85080095126;2-s2.0-85080095126;2-s2.0-85080095126

The total percent mortality of CDH was 37.7%, with hospital-based registries having more deaths among live births than population-based registries (45.1% vs. 33.8%). Mortality rates decreased over time (average annual percent change =-2.4%; 95% CI:-3.8 to 1.1). Most deaths due to CDH occurred among 2-to 6-day-old infants for both registry types (36.3%, hospital-based; 12.1%, population-based).& nbsp; Conclusions: The mortality of CDH has decreased over time.

A multi-stage stochastic programming is proposed from the demand side in order to understand the rational decisions. The consumer preferences are modeled as a risk-averse function under additive uncertainty. The user chooses the optimal consumption profile to maximize his economic benefits for each period. The stochastic optimization problem is solved backward in time. A particular situation is developed when the system operator (SO) uses consumption of the previous interval as the household-specific baseline for the DR program. It is found that a rational consumer alters the baseline in order to increase the well-being when there is an economic incentive. As results, whether the incentive is lower than the retail price, the user shifts his load requirement to the baseline setting period. On the other hand, if the incentive is greater than the regular energy price, the optimal decision is that the user spends the maximum possible energy in the baseline setting period and reduces the consumption at the PTR time. This consumer behavior produces more energy consumption in total considering all periods. In addition, the user with high uncertainty level in his energy pattern should spend less energy than a predictable consumer when the incentive is lower than the retail price. (C) 2016 Elsevier B.V.

Historically, it has been difficult to accurately verify the rates of hypoglycemia within a clinical setting and there is a need for high-quality, real-world data to ascertain the true rates of hypoglycemia in clinical practice. The global Hypoglycemia Assessment Tool (HAT) study was designed to assess the global incidence of hypoglycemia in patients with insulin-treated diabetes, and the results have indicated that the overall incidence of hypoglycemia is high, with large variations between geographical regions. Methods: The International Operations HAT (IO HAT) study retrospectively and prospectively assessed the incidence of hypoglycemia in patients with insulin-treated diabetes in Bangladesh, Colombia, Egypt, Indonesia, Philippines, Singapore, South Africa, Turkey, and United Arab Emirates. Results: During the prospective period, hypoglycemic events were reported by 97.4% of patients with type 1 diabetes and 95.3% of those with type 2 diabetes, with an estimated rate of 6.86 events per patient permonth (PPPM) for patients with type 1 diabetes and 2.37 events PPPM for patients with type 2 diabetes. Conclusions: These results represent the first patient-reported dataset on hypoglycemia in the participating countries and confirm that hypoglycemia is under-reported and more widespread than previously believed. Although the incidence of hypoglycemiawas variable among patients on different treatment regimens, there were substantial impacts on both productivity and healthcare utilization following an episode of hypoglycemia.

Methods: All patients with breast, cervix uteri, lung, prostate and stomach cancer diagnosed between 2003 and 2007 and characterized by the Manizales population-based Cancer Registry (MCR) were included and followed up to a maximum of 5 years for identifying deaths. Survival probabilities estimated by HIR were defined according to the type of affiliation at the date of diagnosis, and by socioeconomic stratification of residence (SS) as indicator of SEP, stratifying for other prognostic factors using Kaplan-Meier methods. Cox proportional hazard models were fitted for multivariate analysis. Results: A total of 1,384 cases and 700 deaths were analyzed. Five-year observed survival was 71.0% (95% IC: 66.1-75.3) for breast, 51.4% (95% IC: 44.6-57.9) for cervix, 15.4% (95% IC: 10.7-20.8) for lung, 71.1% (95% IC: 65.3-76.1) for prostate and 23.8% (95% IC: 19.3-28.6) for stomach. Statistically significant differences in survival by HIR were observed for breast, lung, prostate, and stomach with poorer survival for the subsidized and uninsured patients. Differences by SS were observed for lung and prostate. Differences in survival by HIR were independent of SS, and viceversa.

According to recent global estimates, degraded lands already account for at least 1 and up to 6 billion ha. Given high rates of habitat degradation and loss of biodiversity in human-dominated landscapes with high levels of ecosystem transformation, conventional approaches to conservation such as setting aside lands in protected areas, are not enough; in combination with ecosystem protection, ecological restoration is essential to ensure the conservation of biodiversity and delivery of ecosystem services. Despite recognition of the role of ecological restoration, the planning of restoration at the landscape scale remains a major challenge. Specifically, more studies are needed on developing restoration plans that maximize conservation and provisioning of ecosystem services, while minimizing competition with high-productivity land uses. We use Colombia, one of the world's mega-diversity countries in which ca. 25 % of ecosystems are listed as critically endangered (CR), as a test case for exploring the potential advantages of including the Red List of Ecosystems, a newly developed tool for assessing conservation value, in restoration planning. We identified restoration priorities focused on both high-risk ecosystems and low-productivity lands, to maximize conservation value and minimize land-use conflicts. This approach allowed us to identify over 6 M ha of priority areas for restoration, targeting the restoration of 31 (75 %) of the country's endangered ecosystems. Eight of the Regional Administrative Environmental Planning Areas (CARs) had greater than 20 % of their area identified as restoration priorities. We roughly estimated that the cost of restoring the prioritized areas with restoration through natural regeneration, using payment for ecosystem services (PES), would equal less than 50 % of the annual budget of the CARs. Our results are in sharp contrast (only 12 % agreement) with the priorities identified under the current National Restoration Strategy of Colombia, and highlight the potential contribution of the Red List of Ecosystems in refining and improving restoration planning strategies at both national and sub-national levels.",Article,"Etter, A.; Andrade, A.; Nelson, C.R.; Cortes, J.; Saavedra, K.",Ecosystems at risk; Environmental degradation; Prioritization; Land use trade-offs,Ecosystems at risk;Environmental degradation;Prioritization;Land use trade-offs;LAND-USE;ECOLOGICAL RESTORATION;CONSERVATION;BIODIVERSITY;EXPANSION;PATTERNS;MANAGEMENT;COLOMBIA;TIME,Colombia;United States,2-s2.0-85087117833;2-s2.0-85087117833;2-s2.0-85087117833

Different studies have suggested that early laparoscopy (EL) could be an adequate tool to accelerate diagnosis and therapy. The aim of this study was to assess the effectiveness of EL in terms of diagnosis, persistence of NSAP, mortality, morbidity, cost, hospital stay, and quality of life relative to observation in NSAP. We performed a systematic review to identify randomized controlled trials (RTC) comparing EL versus active observation (AO) in NSAP. The primary outcomes were the number of patients with positive and negative findings, the utility for each group, and the cases with persistence of NSAP. Methodologic quality was assessed using the recommendations of the Cochrane Collaboration. Five studies that included a total of 921 patients were included: 460 in the EL group and 461 in the AO group. The use of an important methodologic heterogeneity between included studies avoided a pooled analysis. Data suggested that EL performed better in establishing a final diagnosis (79.2-96.9%) vs. AO (28.1-78.1%); however, the final therapeutic utility of laparoscopy was lower than the diagnostic rate (10.9-86.5%). The mortality rate of EL was similar to AO, and morbidity ranged from 1.15 to 23.72% in EL compared with the range from 1.9 to 31.14% in AO. The length of hospital stay ranged from 1.3 to 4.18 days in EL compared with the range from 2 to 7.3 days in AO. There is an important heterogeneity between the populations and in the degree of methodologic quality in the included studies. Data suggest that EL performs better in establishing a final diagnosis after admission, but the lack of uniform information does not allow for the recommendation of EL as a routine strategy in clinical practice. We recommend that a large trial be conducted with specific operative characteristics to solve problems identified in primary trials.",Review,"Dominguez, L.C.; Sanabria, A.; Vega, V.; Osorio, C.",Abdominal pain; Diagnostic laparoscopy; Acute appendicitis; Acute abdomen; Appendectomy,Abdominal pain;Diagnostic laparoscopy;Acute appendicitis;Acute abdomen;Appendectomy;RANDOMIZED CONTROLLED-TRIAL;OPEN APPENDECTOMY;COMPUTED-TOMOGRAPHY;MEDICAL LITERATURE;CLINICAL-TRIAL;USERS GUIDES;MANAGEMENT,Colombia,2-s2.0-79251626595

Methods: A retrospective cohort study using data from English practices from CPRD GOLD (Clinical Practice Research Datalink) and the SCI-Diabetes dataset (Scottish Care Information-Diabetes), with linkage to hospital and mortality data. We identified 101 749 with type 2 diabetes (T2D) in CPRD matched with 378 938 controls without diabetes and 330 892 with type 2 diabetes in SCI-Diabetes between 2006 and 2015. The main exposure was number of optimized risk factors: nonsmoker, total cholesterol <= 4 mmol/L, triglycerides <= 1.7 mmol/L, glycated haemoglobin (HbA1c) <= 53 mmol/mol (<= 7.0%), systolic blood pressure <140mm Hg, or Results: In CPRD, the mean baseline age in T2D was 63 years and 28% had cardio-renal disease (SCI-Diabetes: 62 years; 35% cardio-renal disease).

In CPRD, compared with controls, T2D participants with optimal risk factor control (all risk factors controlled) had a higher risk of CVD events (adjusted hazard ratio, 1.21; 95% confidence interval, 1.12-1.29). In T2D participants from CPRD and SCI-Diabetes, pooled hazard ratios for CVD associated with 5 risk factors being elevated versus optimal risk factor control were 1.09 (95% confidence interval, 1.01-1.17) in people with cardio-renal disease but 1.96 (95% confidence interval, 1.82-2.12) in people without cardio-renal disease. People without cardio-renal disease were younger and more likely to have suboptimal risk factor control but had fewer prescriptions for risk factor modifying medications than those with cardio-renal disease.

It develops a competitive WQT model wherein wetland services are explicitly considered. To participate in a WQT program, an agricultural producer could employ wetlands as his nutrient management practice. Unlike most other management practices, wetlands not only remove nutrients from agricultural runoff but also provide ancillary benefits like wildlife habitat and flood control that do not exclusively accrue to the farmer. Thus, when appropriate, a WQT program should be coupled with additional incentives for wetland creation and restoration, such as using a wetland subsidy. Despite the water quality enhancement properties of wetlands, the model reveals that implementing a wetland subsidy will not necessarily translate into water quality improvements. While wetland creation is externally incentivized, the farm's opportunity cost of fertilizer usage in the WQT market is also reduced. In this sense, a wetland subsidy acts like a fertilizer subsidy. Conditions under which a wetland subsidy will help expand WQT include some degree of farmland area fixity, which is resembled in some, but not all, watersheds, and high efficiency of the wetland abatement technology.

Availability of health insurance may play a role in explaining this behavior. Some patients with diabetes skip preventive measures because they have insurance and calculate that they can access curative services later in life. Insurers may limit preventive services coverage because they can't be assured of sharing in the eventual savings that emerge when a chronic condition such as diabetes is managed properly. Our analysis of a nationally representative sample of Colombians who have type 2 diabetes and who pay premiums into the country's ""contributory"" insurance program, found no evidence that insurance influences those individuals to avoid preventive services. The evidence is less clear for those participating in a different, fully subsidized insurance program, who-despite the availability of preventive care-are no more likely to seek preventive visits than are uninsured patients. We propose controlled experiments to identify and measure the true causal effects of insurance on prevention and, more broadly, steps to increase patients' understanding of the benefits of prevention.",Article,"Trujillo, A.J.; Ortiz, A.I.V.; Gomez, F.R.; Steinhardt, L.C.",,EPIDEMIOLOGIC TRANSITION;MELLITUS;MANAGEMENT;COUNTRIES;SERVICES;CARE,United States;Colombia,

This approach corresponds to a time-of-use solution which is an indirect method, based on prices, for inducing demand modifications on consumers. An aggregator of EV fleet acts as a dealer between an electricity market and consumers. The EV aggregator is a price-taker agent from the wholesale electricity market viewpoint and price designer when selling energy to consumers. A game-theoretical model based on a Stackelberg formulation is proposed to capture the interactions between the fleet operator and electric vehicle owners, avoiding the requirement of a price elasticity model for the EV clusters. The interaction between the agents is formulated as a bi-level optimization problem: At the upper-level, the aggregator maximizes its benefits whereas the lower-level represents the dynamic behaviour of rational drivers as a fleet. The EV operator faces uncertainty in wholesale prices when buying energy and when forecasting consumption behaviour, then random parameters are modelled in a scenario framework. The model performance is evaluated through a case study using historical data from car-sharing services in Italy, comparing the result with a fixed-prices model. It is shown that the proposed price-based scheme allows to increment the aggregator profit with respect to a fixed-price contract, producing also a load shifting effect in the charging profile of the fleet.

Methods: This is a secondary analysis of the Dementia Study of Western Norway (Demvest). For this study, we analysed a sample of 186 patients, 116 with AD and 70 with DLB. Subjects were included at a time in which mild dementia was diagnosed according to consensus criteria after comprehensive standardized assessment. Frailty was evaluated retrospectively using a frailty index generated from existing data. The cut-off value used to classify an older adult as frail was 0.25. Results: The prevalence of frailty was 25.81% (n = 48). In the DLB group, 37.14% (n = 26) were classified as frail, compared to 18.97% (n = 22) of those with AD (p < 0.001). The adjusted multivariate analysis revealed an OR of 2.45 (1.15-5.23) for being frail in those with DLB when using AD as the reference group. Conclusion: Frailty was higher than expected in both types of dementia. The prevalence of frailty was higher in those with DLB compared to AD. This new finding underscores the need for a multi-systems approach in both dementias, with a particular focus on DLB. (C) 2019 The Author(s) Published by S.

Ventilator injury and oxygen toxicity are thought to be important factors in the pathogenesis of chronic pulmonary disease. Evidence from animal studies and from adult human studies indicates that high-frequency jet ventilation may reduce the severity of lung injury associated with mechanical ventilation. Objectives To compare use of high-frequency jet ventilation (HFJV) versus conventional ventilation (CV) in preterm infants with severe pulmonary dysfunction. Subgroup analyses include the following. Trials with and without surfactant replacement therapy. Trials with and without strategies to maintain lung volume. Trials with infants of different gestational ages and birth weights (specific subgroups to include < 28 weeks' gestation and < 1000 grams). Trials with and without adequate humidification of inspired gases. Search methods The original search included MEDLINE (1966 to August 2005), the Cochrane Central Register of Controlled Trials (CENTRAL; 2005, Issue 3) and EMBASE (1988 to August 2005). We also obtained information from experts in the field and checked cross-references. We updated the electronic search in June 2013 and again in June 2015. Selection criteria We included in this systematic review randomised and quasi-randomised controlled trials of rescue high-frequency jet ventilation versus conventional ventilation in preterm infants born at less than 35 weeks' gestation or with birth weight less than 2000 grams in respiratory distress. Data collection and analysis We used standard methods of the Cochrane Neonatal Review Group, including independent trial assessment and data extraction. We analysed data using risk ratios (RRs) and risk differences (RDs). Main results We included only one trial in the review. Keszler 1991 randomly assigned 166 preterm infants; reported data on 144 infants; and permitted cross-over to the alternate treatment if initial treatment failed. Investigators found no statistically significant differences in overall mortality (including survival after cross-over) between the two groups (RR 1.07, 95% confidence interval (CI) 0.67 to 1.72). In a secondary analysis of infants up to the time of cross-over, rescue treatment with HFJV was associated with lower mortality (RR 0.66, 95% CI 0.45 to 0.97). Researchers reported no significant differences in the incidence of CLD among survivors at 28 days of age, nor in the incidence of intraventricular haemorrhage, new air leaks, airway obstruction and necrotising tracheobronchitis. Authors' conclusions Study authors reported no significant differences in overall mortality between rescue high-frequency jet ventilation and conventional ventilation and presented highly imprecise results for important adverse effects such as intraventricular haemorrhage, new air leaks, airway obstruction and necrotising tracheobronchitis. The overall quality of evidence is affected by limitations in trial design and by imprecision due to the small number of infants in the included study. Existing evidence does not support the use of high-frequency jet ventilation as rescue therapy in preterm infants. Studies that target populations at greatest risk and that have sufficient power to assess important outcomes are needed. These trials should incorporate long-term pulmonary and neurodevelopmental outcomes.",Review,"Rojas-Reyes, M.X.; Orrego-Rojas, P.A.","High-Frequency Jet Ventilation; Infant, Premature; Infant, Very Low Birth Weight; Salvage Therapy; Randomized Controlled Trials as Topic Respiration, Artificial; Respiratory Distress Syndrome, Newborn [therapy]; Humans; Infant, Newborn","High-Frequency Jet Ventilation;Infant, Premature;Infant, Very Low Birth Weight;Salvage Therapy;Randomized Controlled Trials as Topic Respiration, Artificial;Respiratory Distress Syndrome, Newborn [therapy];Humans;Infant, Newborn;SURFACTANT TREATMENT;QUALITY;MANAGEMENT;AIRWAY",Colombia,2-s2.0-84979856725

In this paper, a model of location and modification of school capacity is presented as an alternative to reduce these inequalities. In Chile a student school choice is a process that depends not only on the time and income constraints but also on the decisions made by other students (segregation). This behavior is modeled using a microeconomic approach; thereby a constrained multinomial logit discrete choice model is derived. By incorporating the student's school choice in an optimization model, it becomes nonlinear. A Tabu Search metaheuristic is proposed, which unlike other implementations requires solving a fixed point system of equations to evaluate each solution. A computing experience for instances of 10 and 45 zones is developed; in the first the quality of the solution is evaluated compared to the optimum obtained by enumeration and in the second different scenarios are analyzed.

Several conservation planning studies have used threatened freshwater fishes or species that are vulnerable to climate change as conservation targets, but none has included both in priority-setting analysis. The objectives of this study were to identify gaps in the coverage of the existing protected areas in representing the endemic freshwater fishes of the Tropical Andes region, and to identify conservation priority areas that adequately cover threatened species and species vulnerable to climate change. Data on 648 freshwater fishes from the Tropical Andes were used to identify gaps in the protected area coverage, and to identify conservation priority sites under three scenarios: (i) prioritize threatened species; (ii) prioritize species that are vulnerable to climate change; and (iii) prioritize both threatened species and species vulnerable to climate change. A total of 571 species (88% of all species) were not covered by any protected areas; most of them are restricted to <= 10 catchments. To represent both threatened species and species vulnerable to climate change in the third scenario, 635 catchments were identified as priority areas, representing 26.5% of the study area. The number of irreplaceable catchments for this scenario is 475, corresponding to 22.5% of the total area. The results of this study could be crucial for designing strategies for the effective protection of native fish populations in the Tropical Andes, and for planning proactive climate adaptation.

We have previously reported that the most prevalent breast cancer intrinsic subtype in Colombian women was Luminal B as defined by St. Gallen 2013 criteria. In this study we explored ancestry-associated differences in molecular profiles of Luminal B tumors among these highly admixed women. Methods We performed whole-transcriptome RNA-seq analysis in 42 Luminal tumors (21 Luminal A and 21 Luminal B) from Colombian women. Genetic ancestry was estimated from a panel of 80 ancestry-informative markers (AIM). We categorized patients according to Luminal subtype and to the proportion of European and Indigenous American ancestry and performed differential expression analysis comparing Luminal B against Luminal A tumors according to the assigned ancestry groups. Results We found 5 genes potentially modulated by genetic ancestry: ERBB2 (log2FC = 2.367, padj<0.01), GRB7 (log2FC = 2.327, padj<0.01), GSDMB (log2FC = 1.723, padj<0.01, MIEN1 (log2FC = 2.195, padj<0.01 and ONECUT2 (log2FC = 2.204, padj<0.01). In the replication set we found a statistical significant association between ERBB2 expression with Indigenous American ancestry (p = 0.02, B = 3.11). This association was not biased by the distribution of HER2+ tumors among the groups analyzed. Conclusions Our results suggest that genetic ancestry in Hispanic/Latina women might modify ERBB2 gene expression in Luminal tumors. Further analyses are needed to confirm these findings and explore their prognostic value.",Article,"Serrano-Gomez, S.J.; Sanabria-Salas, M.A.C.; Garay, J.; Baddoo, M.C.; Hernandez-Suarez, G.; Mejia, J.C.; Garcia, O.; Miele, L.; Fejerman, L.; Zabaleta, J.",,CANCER INTRINSIC SUBTYPES;GRB7;HER2;IMMUNOHISTOCHEMISTRY;CHEMOTHERAPY;CLASSIFICATION;IDENTIFICATION;POLYMORPHISMS;ASSOCIATION;MANAGEMENT,Colombia;United States,2-s2.0-85029029414;2-s2.0-85029029414
,,,13,WOS:000467728400002,2019,A Review on Self-Healing and Self-Organizing Techniques for Wireless Sensor Networks,"We present the state-of-the-art related to self-organizing and self-healing techniques. On the one hand, self-organization is the nodes' ability to construct a network topology without any human intervention and any previous topology knowledge. On the other hand, self-healing is the network's ability to recover from failures by using hardware and software redundancies. By using both techniques, Wireless Sensor Networks (WSNs) can be deployed in unattended and harsh environments where on-site technical service is unfeasible. In the last few years, a large amount of work has been done in these two research areas, but these different techniques occur at different layers and with no general classification or effort to consolidate them. One of the contributions of this paper is the consolidation of the most significant and relevant mechanisms in these two areas, and additionally, we made an effort to organize and classify them. In this review, we explain in detail the two stages of self-organization, namely topology construction and management. Moreover, we present a comprehensive study of the four steps in a self-healing technique, namely, information collection, fault detection, fault classification and fault recovery. By introducing relevant work, comparative tables, and future trends, we provide the reader with a complete picture of the state-of-the-art. Another contribution is the proposal of a unified framework that employs self-organizing and self-healing mechanisms to achieve a fault-tolerant network.",Review,"Diaz, S.; Mendez, D.; Kraemer, R.",Topology construction; topology management; fault detection; fault classification; fault recovery,Topology construction;topology management;fault detection;fault classification;fault recovery;DUTY-CYCLE;ENERGY;MANAGEMENT;ALGORITHM;DIAGNOSIS;FAILURES;SCHEME;SECURE,Colombia;Germany,2-s2.0-85052552601;2-s2.0-85052552601

The clinical implications of this disease process depend on intrinsic patient factors such as age, genetics, epigenetics, voiding habits, anatomic anomalies, and extrinsic factors such as the pathogenicity of infectious agents. Knowledge about its natural history, the implications of conservative and surgical management, and their associated outcomes have evolved dramatically over time. This study aimed to use bibliometric analyses to summarize the evolution of VUR management overtime. In order to accomplish this, the most referenced articles for VUR since 1950 were identified, and a comprehensive analysis of their impact on the management and understanding of VUR was performed by creating a novel impact index. Methods A reference search was carried out for indexed citations through the portal 'Science Citation Index' in the subsection 'Web of Science Core Collection' using 'vesicoureteral reflux' as a MeSH term. References were analyzed and subcategorized according to various subtopics. A unique impact index was developed to adjust the number of publications for the time since publication, in order to define the impact of the paper amongst the most frequently I cited papers. Articles were analyzed and data were tabulated according to the number of citations, country and institute of origin, journal of publication, impact factor, and first authorship. Results Citation counts ranged from 43 to 510, and the mean number of citations per publication was 101.43. The most discussed topic was 'treatment'. The impact index showed that more recent publications have a higher impact. The author with the highest index impact had 271 citations in a period of 5 years. The top 150 articles were published across 23 countries, the majority being from the USA (Summary fig.). The most frequently cited institution had 12 publications. The journal with the highest publication referencing rate was the Journal of Urology. Conclusion The most cited articles were valuable sources of information to describe the historical evolution of the pathophysiology and management of VUR. After adjusting for time since publication, the most recent publications (i.e. those published after 1990) had a higher impact index. Combining traditional bibliometric analysis with this novel impact index may allow researchers to optimize future literature analyses, while also assisting clinicians in understanding best practices for patient management based on the available literature.

This research also examines employee well-being as a mediator to explain the effects of interpersonal conflicts at work on knowledge-hiding behaviors. Design/methodology/approach First, relevant literature provided the theoretical basis for the conceptual model that links the core constructs of this research. A quantitative study collected data from 395 employees of a global consulting firm with a branch located in a developing country. Finally, an analysis of the structural equation modeling with MPlus 7 software tested the measurement and the structural model. Findings The results of this study suggest that interpersonal conflict at work influences knowledge-hiding and that employee's well-being mediates this relationship. In other words, employees strategically choose what knowledge-hiding behaviors to use - such as evasion or ""playing dumb"" - to cope with the lack of well-being caused by high interpersonal conflicts in the workplace. Originality/value Although contextual and individual factors may trigger knowledge-hiding behavior at work, the current literature has overlooked the combined effects of such factors, especially in service settings. Knowledge hiding in service organizations is a weakness that can lead to significant economic losses, especially in firms that are intensively knowledge-based. Thus, it is necessary to identify the antecedents of knowledge-hiding behavior to deter low performance in these organizations.",Article,"Losada-Otalora, M.; Pena-Garcia, N.; Sanchez, I.D.",Interpersonal conflict at work; Knowledge hiding; Employee well-being; Service organizations; Professional service firms; Service operations,Interpersonal conflict at work;Knowledge hiding;Employee well-being;Service organizations;Professional service firms;Service operations;CROSS-SECTIONAL ANALYSES;DEMANDS-RESOURCES MODEL;EMOTIONAL LABOR;MODERATING ROLE;JOB-SATISFACTION;SOCIAL SUPPORT;PLACE ATTACHMENT;WORKPLACE INCIVILITY;MANAGEMENT;BEHAVIOR,Colombia,2-s2.0-85096512545
,,,13,WOS:000464153200004,2019,The changing chagras: traditional ecological knowledge transformations in the Colombian Amazon,"Shifting agriculture systems in the Colombian Amazon, locally known as chagras, have been traditionally managed by indigenous peoples following their traditional ecological knowledge (TEK). However, different socioeconomic drivers of change are affecting indigenous chagra TEK, resulting in changes in practices and land-use patterns. This study examines TEK transformations from 1970 to 2016 and their relation to rainforest management in the Ticuna indigenous resguardo of El Vergel (Leticia Municipality, Amazonas Department). It employs an ethnographic case study design that articulates quantitative data on land-use variables related to chagras and qualitative ethnographic data describing dimensions of TEK and its perceived transformations, including knowledge of the environment, practices and management systems, social institutions, and worldviews. Our findings reveal that TEK transformations entail changes in land-use, including size of production area, temporality of land-use, and cultivated diversity. This study contributes to a reinterpretation of TEK transformations and emphasizes the importance of the chagra as an adaptive system. The TEK transformations related to chagras imply a constant reattunement of relations that bind people and their environments. Rather than being frozen in an ethnographic past, people have responded to social and economic drivers to meet their current needs and aspirations. Likewise, understanding TEK transformations and their relation to changes in land-use practices provides relevant insights about social-ecological dynamics in the Amazon rainforest to navigate change and provide the basis for a discussion of how to enrich management decisions to move toward sustainability in tropical forests.",Article,"Fonseca-Cepeda, V.; Idrobo, C.J.; Restrepo, S.",Amazon rainforest; chagra; Colombia; indigenous people; land use; traditional ecological knowledge,Amazon rainforest;chagra;Colombia;indigenous people;land use;traditional ecological knowledge;LAND-COVER CHANGE;SLASH-AND-BURN;SHIFTING CULTIVATION;SWIDDEN CULTIVATION;TROPICAL FORESTS;SUSTAINABILITY;AGRICULTURE;MANAGEMENT;DYNAMICS;DRIVERS,Colombia,2-s2.0-85065799999

The present study attempts to describe the clinical characteristics of patients with AAD and to determine the presence of Clostridium difficile, utilizing the polymerase chain reaction (PCR) technique. Materials and methods: Forty-three patients with AAD, managed at the Hospital Universitario San Ignacio in Bogota, Colombia, were evaluated. Prospective patient information was collected, with respect to demographic characteristics, profile of the antibiotic management received, clinical manifestations, risk factors, and paraclinical reports. In addition, the real time PCR test for Clostridium difficile (Cepheid Xpert (R), Sunnyvale, CA, United States) was performed. Results: Patient mean age was 58 years (19.31 SD). The majority of the patients received 2 or more antibiotics (62.9%) and the beta-lactams were the most frequently used. Hospital stay ranged from 2 to 104 days with a median of 10 days. The most frequent clinical manifestations were abdominal pain and bloating, followed by fever and tachycardia. At the time of diagnosis, 23 patients had noninflammatory results in the stool sample analyses and 18 had kidney failure. The mean level of albumin was 2.4mg/dl (0.7 SD). The presence of Clostridium difficile was documented through PCR in 6 patients (13.95% of the cases). Conclusions: AAD patients were characterized by a high frequency of severe comorbidities and prolonged hospital stay. The presence of Clostridium difficile in only 13.9% of the cases suggests that other causes of diarrhea in the hospitalized patient should be considered.

Preventive or therapeutic interventions are difficult to implement and maintain over time. On the other hand, the majority of adolescents in the United States have a smartphone, representing a huge potential for innovative digitized interventions, such as weight loss programs delivered via smartphone applications. Although the number of available smartphone applications is increasing, evidence for their effectiveness in weight loss is insufficient. Therefore, the proposed study aims to assess the efficacy of a gamification-based smartphone application for weight loss in overweight and obese adolescents. The trial is designed to be a phase II, single-centre, two-arm, triple-blinded, randomized controlled trial (RCT) with a duration of 6 months. Method: The intervention consists of a smartphone application that provides both tracking and gamification elements, while the control arm consists of an identically designed application solely with tracking features of health information. The proposed trial will be conducted in an urban primary care clinic of an academic centre in the United States of America, with expertise in the management of overweight and obese adolescents. Eligible adolescents will be followed for 6 months. Changes in body mass index z score from baseline to 6 months will be the primary outcome. Secondary objectives will explore the effects of the gamification-based application on adherence, as well as anthropometric, metabolic and behavioural changes. A required sample size of 108 participants (54 participants per group) was calculated. Discussion: The benefits of the proposed study include mid-term effects in weight reduction for overweight and obese adolescents. The current proposal will contribute to fill a gap in the literature on the mid-term effects of gamification-based interventions to control weight in adolescents.

Glutamate excitotoxicity is likely the main cause of neuronal death, and Riluzole interferes with glutamate-mediated transmission. Thus, in such independent pathway, these effects may be partly due to inactivation of voltage-dependent sodium channels. Here we predict the structural model of the interaction and report the possible binding sites of Riluzole on Nav1.6 channel. The docked complexes were subjected to minimization and we further investigated the key interacting residues, binding free energies, pairing bridge determination, folding pattern, hydrogen bounding formation, hydrophobic contacts and flexibilities. Our results demonstrate that Riluzole interacts with the Nav1.6 channel, more specifically in the key residues TYR 1787, LEU 1843 and GLN 1799, suggesting possible cellular implications driven by these amino acids on Riluzole-Nav1.6 interaction, which may serve as an important output for a more specific and experimental drug design therapy against ALS.

Although the concept of CX is widely used, not much has been examined about how external touch points impact customer perception of experience. Therefore, the main purpose of this study is to examine the role and impact of internal and external touchpoints as dimensions of customer experience and how CX can impact consumer word-of-mouth intention. Service outcome and peace of mind were used to represent internal experience touchpoints and peer to peer quality (PTP) was used to represent an external experience touchpoint. A total of 293 usable surveys were used for analysis using a Bayesian model developed for this study instead of the more traditional SEM approaches. Results showed that an external experience touchpoint has a similar impact to those of internal experience touchpoints in the experience process. CX was also found to have a strong effect on customer word of mouth intention. These findings make various contributions to the literature on CX, especially to research differentiating internal from external experience touchpoints.

The aim of this study was to evaluate the risk factors associated with MRSA SSTI in Colombia. Methods: A multicenter cohort study with nested case-control design was performed. Patients with an SSTI with at least 48 h of inpatient care were included. Patients with an MRSA SSTI were considered the case group and patients with either a non-MRSA SSTI or with an Methicillin-susceptible S. aureus (MSSA) SSTI were the control groups. A multivariate logistic regression approach was used to evaluate risk factors associated with MRSA SSTI with two different statistical models. Results: A total 1134 patients were included. Cultures were positive for 498 patients, of which 52% (n = 259) were Staphylococcus aureus. MRSA was confirmed in 68.3% of the S. aureus cultures. In the first model, independent risk factors for MRSA SSTI were identified as the presence of abscess (P < 0.0001), cellulitis (P = 0.0007), age 18-44 years (P = 0.001), and previous outpatient treatment in the previous index visit (P = 0.003); surgical site infection was a protective factor (P = 0.008). In the second model, the main risk factor found was previous outpatient treatment in the previous index visit (P = 0.013). Conclusions: Community-acquired SSTIs in Colombia are commonly caused by MRSA. Therefore, clinicians should consider MRSA when designing the initial empirical treatment for purulent SSTI in Colombia, although there seems to be low awareness of this fact. (C) 2019 The Authors.

Fabry disease, an X-linked lysosomal storage disorder caused by pathogenic variants in GLA, can lead to end-stage renal disease, cardiac arrhythmias, and stroke. Diagnostic delays are common due to the rarity of the disease and non-specificity of early symptoms. Newborn screening and screening of at-risk populations, (e.g., patients with hypertrophic cardiomyopathy or undiagnosed nephropathies) can identify individuals with Fabry disease. Subsequent cascade genotyping of family members may disclose a greater number of affected individuals, often at younger age than they would have been diagnosed otherwise. Methods: We conducted a literature search to identify all published data on family genetic testing for Fabry disease, and discussed these data, experts' own experiences with family genetic testing, and the barriers to this type of screening that are present in their respective countries. Results: There are potential barriers that make implementation of family genetic testing challenging in some countries. These include associated costs and low awareness of its importance, and cultural and societal issues. Regionally, there are barriers associated with population educational levels, national geography and infrastructures, and a lack of medical geneticists.

Potential distribution models and landscape connectivity studies have increased with regard to their utility to prioritizing areas for conservation. The objective of this study was to model the potential distribution of Mountain cloud forests in the Transversal Volcanic System, Michoacan and to analyze the role of these areas in maintaining landscape connectivity. Potential distribution was modeled for the Mountain cloud forests based on the maximum entropy approach using 95 occurrence points and 17 ecological variables at 30 m spatial resolution. Potential connectivity was then evaluated by using a probability of connectivity index based on graph theory. The percentage of variation (dPCk) was used to identify the individual contribution of each potential area of Mountain cloud forests in overall connectivity. The different ways in which the potential areas of Mountain cloud forests can contribute to connectivity were evaluated by using the three fractions derived from dPCk (dPCintrak, dPCfluxk, and dPCconnectork). We determined that 37,567 ha of the TVSMich are optimal for the presence of Mountain cloud forests. The contribution of said area in the maintenance of connectivity was low. The conservation of Mountain cloud forests is indispensable, however, in providing or receiving dispersal flows through TVSMich because of its role as a connector element between another habitat types. The knowledge of the potential capacity of Mountain cloud forests to promote structural and functional landscape connectivity is key in the prioritization of conservation areas.",Article,"Ayram, C.A.C.; Mendoza, M.E.; Etter, A.; Salicrup, D.R.P.",Cloud forest; Potential distribution modeling; Potential connectivity; Graph theory; Conservation planning; Mexico,Cloud forest;Potential distribution modeling;Potential connectivity;Graph theory;Conservation planning;Mexico;HABITAT AVAILABILITY;CLIMATE-CHANGE;RANGE EXPANSION;VOLCANIC BELT;PATCHES;IMPACT;AREAS;TOOL;MANAGEMENT;SURFACES,Mexico;Colombia,2-s2.0-85017646319
,,,9,WOS:000634266200009,2021,A machine learning approach to segmentation of tourists based on perceived destination sustainability and trustworthiness,"Segmentation studies are crucial for planning sustainability strategies, and tourists? perceptions of destinations offer important segmentation criteria. The aim of this study is to understand and describe the tourist segments with similar levels of perceived destination sustainability and trustworthiness. Perceived sustainability and perceived trustworthiness are based on tourists? perceptions of the impacts of tourism development and policies of destinations and are measured as multidimensional constructs. Based on a sample of 438 tourists from Chile and Ecuador aged over 17 years, a metaheuristic (genetic algorithm) is employed to select the most useful variables for segmentation using a machine learning process. The results reveal three tourist segments: Extremely optimistic (Segment 3), Optimistic (Segment 2) and Moderately optimistic (Segment 1). These segments differ considerably in terms of the impacts of the dimensions of destination sustainability (environmental, sociocultural, and economic) and trustworthiness (ability, benevolence, and integrity). However, they do not differ in terms of most sociodemographic characteristics. As segmentation criteria, perceived sustainability and trustworthiness can help when analyzing the effectiveness of sustainability strategies and actions by the public and private institutions at tourist destinations.",Article,"Penagos-Londono, G.I.; Rodriguez-Sanchez, C.; Ruiz-Moreno, F.; Torres, E.",Segmentation; Perceived sustainability; Trustworthiness; Security; Machine learning approach; Genetic algorithm,Segmentation;Perceived sustainability;Trustworthiness;Security;Machine learning approach;Genetic algorithm;SCALE DEVELOPMENT;CONSUMER-TRUST;BEHAVIOR;SAFETY;MODEL;OPPORTUNITIES;VALIDATION;MANAGEMENT;ATTITUDES,Colombia;Spain;Chile,2-s2.0-85097410976

It is commonly caused by the biallelic compromise of one of 22 genes involved in the FA/BRCA repair pathway in most cases. The diagnosis is based on clinical suspicion and confirmation using genetic analysis, where the chromosomal breakage test is considered the gold standard. Other diagnostic methods used include western blotting, multiplex ligation-dependent probe amplification and next-generation sequencing. This genetic condition has variable expressiveness, which makes early diagnosis difficult in certain cases. Although early diagnosis does not currently allow for improved cure rates for this condition, it does enable healthcare professionals to perform a specific systematic follow-up and, if indicated, a bone marrow transplantation that improves the mobility and mortality of affected individuals.

The specific type of MCDA our research proposes is known as CRIDE (multi-CRIteria DEcision support tool), which allows us to study various methods of RWH. In order to account for uncertainties such as the variability of expert opinions and imprecision stemming from the different criteria required, we have designed this tool to incorporate ELECTRE II and the Monte Carlo method. For this case study we apply a methodology that evaluates the performance of six RWH scenarios. These six input scenarios emerged from an ideal one, wherein all rainwater throughout the campus is successfully harvested and treated until potable. From there, reality sets in: the other five scenarios are varying degrees of deviance from the ideal one, both in terms of water quantity and quality. In regard to collection and treatment we used sustainable urban drainage systems (SUDS). As for the evaluation of each of the scenarios, we outline eight criteria, which include hydraulic performance, compatibility with the University's Master Plan and financial aspects. Our research concludes that CRIDE as a means of support during the decision-making process generates a complete view of possible solutions, in addition to ranking these solutions. The CRIDE-based approach allows for the proposal of a methodology that evaluates the relevance of an established criteria set, using robustness, redundancy and sensitivity.",Article,"Galarza-Molina, S.L.; Torres, A.; Moura, P.; Lara-Borrero, J.",Multi-criteria decision analysis (MCDA); decision support tool (DST); ELECTRE II; Monte Carlo method; rainwater harvesting (RWH); sustainable urban drainage systems (SUDS),Multi-criteria decision analysis (MCDA);decision support tool (DST);ELECTRE II;Monte Carlo method;rainwater harvesting (RWH);sustainable urban drainage systems (SUDS);MULTIATTRIBUTE UTILITY-THEORY;SENSITIVITY-ANALYSIS;WATER;MANAGEMENT;STORMWATER;CRITERIA;UNCERTAINTY;SELECTION;DRAINAGE;SYSTEM,Colombia;Brazil,2-s2.0-84929339855

Methods. - Relevant trials that included patients with acute renal colic and radiological findings of urinary stones were identified in four databases. The main outcome was pain relief evaluated by Visual Analogue Scale score (VAS). Results. - In overall, diclofenac was superior to other NSAIDs for pain relief (MD of -12.57 [95% CI: -19.26, -5.88]). Paracetamol was superior to morphine for pain reduction at 30 minutes (MD of -3.92 [95% CI: -6.41, -1.43]) and also to placebo at 15 minutes (MD of -24.77 [95% CI: -33.19, -16.35]) and at 30 minutes (MD of 16 [95% CI:-29, -2.96]) after drug administration. Finally, diclofenac was superior to paracetamol for pain reduction at 60 (MD of 6.60 [95% CI: 4.37, 8.83]) and 90 minutes (MD of 3.4 [95% CI: 2.01, 4.79]). Conclusions. - Diclofenac was superior to other NSAIDs and paracetamol for diminishing pain in patients suffering an acute stone episode. Paracetamol was superior to morphine and placebo for short pain relief. Future trials should address the role of paracetamol in the management of pain in patients suffering an acute stone episode.

,,,8,WOS:000468072800001,2018,A simulation-optimization approach for the surgery scheduling problem: a case study considering stochastic surgical times,"This work studies the scheduling of elective procedures, with stochastic durations, in surgery rooms. Given a set of rooms with limited availability and a set of procedures, it must be decided in which room and when each procedure will be performed. The problem's objectives are to maximize the use of the operating rooms and to minimize the delays in starting the scheduled surgeries. A simulation-optimization approach is proposed. First, procedures' durations are modeled as random variables and a set of test percentiles (i.e. it is assumed that all surgeries will last as many minutes as the 75th percentile of its probability density function) is selected. Subsequently, using these durations as a parameter, a greedy randomized adaptive search procedure (GRASP) is run. Consequently, as many solutions as selected test percentiles are generated. Finally, a Monte Carlo simulation is used to estimate three indicators: i) rooms utilization, ii) percentage of surgeries that had delays, and iii) average delay time of scheduled surgeries. The technique was tested by solving the elective procedures scheduling problem in a high-complexity hospital in Bogota. This hospital has 19 operating rooms and 35,000 surgeries performed annually. Currently, the scheduling process is manual. The simulation-optimization proposed approach allowed to determine the relation between utilization rate and delays in the service. As the occupation percentage increases, delay times also augment, implying a reduction of the service level. An average reduction of 5% in delay times entails a reduction between 3% and 9% of operating room occupancy. (C) 2018 Growing Science Ltd.

,,,8,WOS:000638804100001,2021,Is it possible to share tacit knowledge using information and communication technology tools?,"Purpose - This study aims to determine whether it is possible to use information and communication technology (ICT) tools to share tacit knowledge. Few studies have considered this subject, and they have reported both the ineffectiveness and effectiveness of ICT tools for sharing tacit knowledge. Design/methodology/approach - In this study, the participants comprised 217 knowledge workers from New Zealand and researchers who attended a knowledge management conference in the UK. In all, 59% of the sample was men and 41% women. The research model compared the scores of knowledge workers in two categories of ICT, those that allow dialogue and those that do not, in relation to knowledge sharing in organizations. The instrument used a Likert scale with five levels of response. Findings - It was found that not all ICT technologies let tacit knowledge to be shared, but those ICT that facilitate dialogue, for example, text messaging and video conferences. Emails did not facilitate the exchange of tacit knowledge. Research limitations/implications - It is suggested to replicate the study with different countries to evaluate the role of culture in the communication of tacit knowledge. Practical implications - An implication for practitioners based on this study is that email should not be the preferred mode for transferring knowledge between an organization and their workers. This mode is adequate for the exchange of explicit knowledge, but it has a limited capacity for transferring tacit knowledge. Thus, organizations may increase the use of audio and video tools to transfer electronically tacit knowledge. Interaction or socialization may facilitate the understanding and internalization of tacit knowledge by workers. Originality/value - This study contributed to understand the reason for contradictory results from previous research. ICT tools are effective to share tacit knowledge when they facilitate dialogue. Results also support practitioners about how to obtain more effective exchange of tacit knowledge in organizations.",Article,"Castaneda, D.I.; Toulson, P.",Knowledge sharing; Organizations; Tacit knowledge; Knowledge management; Communication; ICT tools,Knowledge sharing;Organizations;Tacit knowledge;Knowledge management;Communication;ICT tools;SOCIAL MEDIA;SYSTEMS SUCCESS;MANAGEMENT;IMPACT;BEHAVIOR;TEAM,Colombia;New Zealand,2-s2.0-85104076232

Thus, researchers have focused on developing models for estimating soil quality based on artificial intelligence techniques for the processing of multidimensional data from agro-industrial systems, which provide useful information for farmers about soil management and crop conditions. However, a model for the application of these new technologies in medium and low-scale agricultural systems has not been identified. Therefore, a review of recent studies of crop yield prediction based on the estimation of chemical, physical, and biological soil quality indicators (SQI), which incorporate different machine learning (ML) techniques to process data from remote sensing (RS) systems, is presented. The advantages and disadvantages are also analyzed for: SQI estimates at regional and local scale, spectral bands used for analysis of plowed soils (bare soils) of cultivation plots, selection of minimun data set (MDS), use of unmanned aerial vehicle (UAV) and satellite platforms, data pre-processing, and selection of ML algorithms for processing biological systems databases (agro-industrial systems). Finally, we present a model to help estimate soil quality in agricultural systems at a local scale, based on ML to process RS data, in the model the inputs to the ML unit come from four different class data sets (RS, SQI, environmental data and crop management data).

Plastic reconstructive OSS of the penis with a split thickness skin graft has been proposed as a treatment option for penile cancer, with the objective being preservation of physiological voiding and sexual function without comprising oncological control. MATERIALS AND METHODS Multicenter study reporting clinicopathological data of 57 patients with malignant lesions of the penis treated with OSS and plastic reconstructive surgery with split thickness skin graft from 2007 to 2019. Health related quality of life (HRQoL) was assessed with EuroQoL-5D-3L, urinary symptoms with the International Consultation on Incontinence Modular Questionnaire for Male Lower Urinary Tract Symptoms, and erectile function with the International Index of erectile function (IIEF)-5. RESULTS Fifty-seven patients underwent OSS reconstructive surgery. Twenty underwent glans resurfacing, 23 partial penectomy, and 14 glansectomy. Median age was 55.1 years (interquartile range [IQR] 29-90), median follow-up 55.7 months (3-149). At the time of data analysis, 6 patients had died of Squamous Cell Carcinoma (SCC) (12.5%) and 10 (17.8%) had progressed. Kaplan-Meier estimates showed a 5-year survival rate of 87.5% and a 5-year progression-free survival of 83%. We assessed HRQoL and functional outcomes in 32 patients. EuroQol 5D-3L showed a mean health status of 82.5%, median Voiding score of the ICIQ-MLTUS was 4 (IQR 1-15), and median IIEF-5 19 (IQR 10.75-25). CONCLUSION OSS of the penis remains a safe and viable option for the treatment of SCC, ensuring a favorable appearance of the penis, preserving urinary and sexual function, with good HRQoL and without comprising oncological safety in selected cases.

In doing so, we are able to identify ways in which there is a Latin American model (or at least identifiable patterns) of public affairs education in sharp contrast to what might be expected in terms of emulation of international programs, particularly from the United States and Europe. As the basis for our analysis, we rely on three main sources of information. We use extensive data gathered from a survey of nearly 50 programs of public affairs in Latin America, which we administered in 2015 in order to identify patterns and trends in public affairs education in the region. Then, we compare our data with two data bases: (1) the Atlas of Public Policy and Management (Carleton University and the University of Toronto), which provides an international profile of programs, and (2) NASPAA's Data Center, which summarizes the characteristics of NASPAA-member programs based on Annual Survey data. This comparison allows us to establish to what degree there is a phenomenon of isomorphism in public affairs education between countries in Latin America and similar programs in North America. We finish this article exploring the implications of such results, for the quality and appropriateness of education in government affairs in Latin American countries.

Methods This was a cohort study of a random sample of 2043 offspring delivered between 1975 and 1993 at Hospital Sant Joan de D ' eu in Barcelona. Exclusion criteria were multiple pregnancy, aneuploidy or genetic syndrome, major birth defects, severe mental disease and macrosomia. Eligible individuals were contacted and those with at least one offspring were included in the study. Participants were classified according to the presence of SGA (defined as birth weight <10th percentile) at birth. Multiple regression analysis was used to determine the presence of SGA or placenta-mediated disease (defined as the presence of SGA, pre-eclampsia, gestational hypertension and/or placental abruption) in the following generation. Results Of 623 individuals who agreed to participate, 152 (72 born SGA and 80 born appropriatefor-gestational age (AGA)) were reported to have at least one child. Descendants of SGA individuals presented with a lower birth-weight percentile (median, 26 (interquartile range (IQR), 7-52) vs 43 (IQR, 19-75); P < 0.001) and a higher prevalence of SGA (40.3% vs 16.3%; P = 0.001) and placenta-mediated disease (43.1% vs 17.5%; P = 0.001) than did the offspring of AGA individuals. After adjustment for confounding variables, parental SGA background was associated with an almost three-fold increased risk of subsequent SGA or any placenta-mediated disease in the following generation. This association was stronger in SGA mothers than in SGA fathers. Conclusions Our data provide evidence suggesting a transgenerational transmission of SGA, highlighting the importance of public health strategies for preventing intrauterine growth impairment.

The EV studied in this paper is a commercial vehicle only driven by a traction motor. The motor drives the front wheels indirectly through the differential drive. The electrical inverter model and the power-train efficiency are established by lookup tables determined by power tests in a dynamometric bank. The optimization problem is focused on maximizing energy-efficiency between the wheel power and battery pack, not only to maintain but also to improve its value by modifying the state of charge (SOC). The solution is found by means of a Particle Swarm Optimization (PSO) algorithm.

Thanks to this tool, it is possible to identify cryptic species, which possess critical susceptibility patterns. Clinical strains were identified using the MicroScan and MALDI-TOF MS systems. Discrepant results from both methods were investigated using ITS rDNA barcoding. Finally, these isolates were also tested for in vitro susceptibility.ResultsThe percentage of agreement between both methods to 498 yeast isolates was of 93.6% (32 discrepant isolates). The concordance of ITS sequencing with MALDI-TOF MS was higher (99%) than that of MicroScan (94%). Several of these discordant yeasts displayed high MICs for antifungal agents.ConclusionsOur study highlights the need of the MS and molecular approaches such as MALDI-TOF MS and ITS rDNA barcoding for the correct identification of emerging or cryptic yeast species; besides, some of these could be multidrug resistant.This work was the first experience in the implementation of the MALDI-TOF MS technology in Colombia. We found the first uncommon yeasts including Candida auris and we could identify Trichosporon faecalis.

We aimed to provide information to help better inform this decision-making process. METHODS: Costs associated with a 12-week exercise-based rehabilitation program in Colombia for patients with CHF were estimated. We collected data on all medical resources used in ambulatory care and data on hospital costs incurred for treating patients with uncompensated CHF. A literature search to establish the hospitalization rates because of uncompensated CHF, death because of CHF, and potential decreases in these data because of the utilization of CR was conducted. We modeled incremental costs and effectiveness over a period of 5 years from the perspective of the third-party payer. RESULTS: All costs were converted from Colombian pesos to US dollars. For an exercise-based CR program of 12-week duration (36 sessions), costs ranged from US$265 to US$369 per patient. Monthly costs associated with ambulatory care of CHF averaged US$128 +/- US$321 per patient, and hospitalization costs were US$3621 +/- US$5 444 per event. Yearly hospitalization incidence rates with and without CR were 0.154 and 0.216, respectively. The incremental cost of CR would be US$998 per additional quality-adjusted life-year. Sensitivity analysis did not significantly change these results. CONCLUSIONS: Cardiac rehabilitation in patients with CHF in settings such as Colombia can be a cost-effective strategy, with minimal incremental costs and better quality of life, mainly because of decreased rates of hospitalization.",Article,"Rincon, M.; Rojas, M.X.; Romero, V.A.R.; Tamayo, D.C.; Franco, C.; Castro, H.; Brophy, J.; Dennis, R.",cardiac rehabilitation; cost analysis; economics; heart failure,cardiac rehabilitation;cost analysis;economics;heart failure;IN-HOSPITAL OUTCOMES;COST-EFFECTIVENESS;CONTROLLED-TRIAL;GUIDELINES;MANAGEMENT;TRENDS;SAFETY;LIFE,Colombia;Canada,2-s2.0-84952673904

In this study, we aimed to study the potential association of the number of prescribed medications with functional decline trajectories over a five-year follow-up in people diagnosed with mild Alzheimer's disease (AD) or Lewy Body dementia (LBD). Methods: This is a longitudinal analysis of a Norwegian cohort study entitled ""The Dementia Study of Western Norway"". We included 196 patients newly diagnosed with AD (n=111) and LBD (n=85), followed annually for 5 years. We conducted linear mixed-effects models to analyse the association of the number of medications with functional decline measured by the Rapid Disability Rating Scale - 2. Results: The mean prescribed medications at baseline was 4.18 +/- 2.60, for AD 3.92 +/- 2.51 and LBD 4.52 +/- 2.70. The number of medications increased during the follow-up; at year five the mean for AD was 7.28 +/- 4.42 and for LBD 8.11 +/- 5.16. Using more medications was associated with faster functional decline in AD (Est 0.04, SE 0.01, p-value 0.003) and LBD (Est 0.08, SE 0.03, p-value 0.008) after adjusting for age, sex, comorbidity, neuropsychiatric symptoms, and cognition. For each medication added during the follow-up, functional trajectories worsened by 1% for AD and 2% for LBD. The number of medications was not associated with cognitive decline. Conclusion: We found that higher number of medications was related to a faster functional decline, both in AD and LBD. With disease progression, there was an increase in the number of medications.

Design/methodology - We use the comparative case studies method to draw on the common features among the seven in-debt cases we built. We are well aware that the method of comparative case studies does not provide a sufficient base for bold generalizations. However, the qualitative approach adopted here allows for the first in-depth look at the strategies that bring surviving entrepreneurs from explosive growth to a more balanced growth path. Findings - We identify four organizational capabilities as key to the survival of these businesses ten years later: first, ability to prioritize product and market development, including internationalization, over operations; second, ability to reorganize internally and delegate in a timely manner; third, ability to manage innovation and support creativity linked to productivity; and finally, ability to manage economic and financial resources.

We aim to report our experience with a new surgical technique for clitoroplasty, completely preserving corporeal bodies, neurovascular bundles without dismembering the clitoris, in four patients with over a year follow up. Materials and Methods: After IRB approval four patients with 46,XX CAH and Prader 5 and 3 external genitalia, underwent feminizing genitoplasty. Complete preservation of erectile tissue was accomplished without a need to dissect dorsal neurovascular bundle. Glans size allowed no need for glanular reduction and there was no need to dismember the corporeal bodies. Results: Four patients 12 to 24-months-old underwent complete corporeal preservation clitoroplasty (CCPC), mean age was 18.5 months, mean follow up was 10.25 months. Vaginoplasty was performed in all patients with partial urogenital mobilization (PUM) and Urogenital Sinus flap (UF), only one severely virilized patient required a parasagittal pre-rectal approach to mobilize the vagina. We had no complications until last follow up. Conclusion: To our knowledge, we are introducing the concept of CCPC without the need of disassembling the corporeal bodies, neurovascular bundle and glans. It stands as a new alternative for feminizing genitoplasty with complete preservation of erectile tissue and no dissection of neurovascular bundle. Although there is still lacking longterm follow-up, it represents a new step in conservative reconfiguration of the external virilized female genitalia.",Article,"Fernandez, N.; Chavarriaga, J.; Perez, J.","Surgical Procedures, Operative; Adrenal Hyperplasia, Congenital; Clitoris","Surgical Procedures, Operative;Adrenal Hyperplasia, Congenital;Clitoris;CONGENITAL ADRENAL-HYPERPLASIA;LONG-TERM;MOBILIZATION;MANAGEMENT;FEMALES",Colombia;United States,2-s2.0-85104317577

More than half of this injuries are located at the cervical region. Twenty percent of victims with cervical spinal trauma and 5% of patients with severe traumatic brain injury (TBI) will have an SCI. Cervical immobilization with rigid or semirigid collars is routinely used as prophylactic or definitive treatment intervention in general trauma care. An important adverse effect of cervical collars application is the increase in intracranial pressure (ICP) values. This systematic review and meta-analysis aim to estimate the overall magnitude of ICP changes after cervical collar application. Methods Major electronic databases (Ovid/Medline, Embase and Cochrane Library) were systematically searched for prospective studies that assessed ICP changes after cervical collar applications. Study level characteristics and ICP values before, during and after cervical collar application, were extracted. The meta-analysis was performed using random-effects model. Results Five studies comprising 86 patients were included in the systematic review and the quantitative synthesis. The overall increase in ICP after collar application was statistically significant (weighted mean difference [WMD] = 4.43; 95%CI 1.70, 7.17; P < 0.01), meaning an overall ICP increase of approximately 4.4 mmHg. The decrease in ICP values after collar removal reached statistical significance (WMD = - 2.99; 95%CI - 5.45, - 0.52; P = 0.02), meaning an overall ICP decrease of approximately 3 mmHg after collar removal. ICP values before and after cervical collar application were not statistically significant (WMD = 0.49; 95%CI - 1.61, 2.59; P = 0.65), meaning no ICP change. Conclusions Heterogeneous studies of application of cervical collars as a partial motion restriction strategy after injuries have demonstrated increases in ICP in TBI patients. Increases in ICP can induce complications in TBI patients. Appropriate selection criteria for cervical motion restriction in TBI patients need to be considered.",Review,"Nunez-Patino, R.A.; Rubiano, A.M.; Godoy, D.A.",Cervical collar; Intracranial pressure; Intracranial hypertension; Traumatic brain injury; Meta-analysis,Cervical collar;Intracranial pressure;Intracranial hypertension;Traumatic brain injury;Meta-analysis;C-SPINE RULE;RIGID COLLAR;ASSOCIATION;MANAGEMENT,Colombia;Argentina,2-s2.0-85068094320

Informal irrigation in Colombia has not been investigated, its national presence has not been identified, and its characteristics are still unknown. The present article aims to help fill this gap. Because of topographical and agricultural patterns, Andean informal irrigation is impossible to identify or characterize using standard methods. To provide information on the scale of informal irrigation systems in Colombia, their type, the users they serve, and the type of water sources they use, a large-scale partial inventory was made combining statistical analysis, questionnaires, interviews, and field trips. The findings indicate that informal irrigation is widespread in the country's mountainous zones, in a great diversity of environments, characterized by an equally great diversity of local uses and water-use strategies.

On the other hand, the increasing demand for natural aggregates for concrete production seriously affects mountains and rivers as they are the source of these nonrenewable goods. Consequently, the recycling of aggregates for concrete is gaining attention worldwide as an alternative to reduce the environmental impacts caused by the extraction of nonrenewable goods and disposal of construction and demolition waste (C&DW). Therefore, this article describes the effect on the mechanical properties of new concrete using recycled aggregates obtained from old paving stones. Results show that replacing 50% by weight of the fine and coarse aggregate fractions in concrete with recycled aggregate does not meaningfully affect its mechanical behavior, making the use of recycled aggregates in new precast paving stones possible.

Methods: Subjects with A1c >= 7% on MS or MG treatment were respectively given glargine (0.2 U/kg starting dose) or sitagliptin (100 mg daily) for 12 weeks. The primary endpoint was number of subjects attaining A1 c goal defined as <7%. Results: After receiving 24-week MS or MG dual therapy in the original EASIE Study, 42% (104/248) on MS and 68% (152/224) on MG attained A1 c < 7% (p < 0.0001). The reduction in A1 c was negatively associated with baseline fasting blood glucose (FBG) only in the MG group. Reduction in A1 c was not related to baseline postprandial blood glucose (PPBG) in either the MG or MS group. Amongst 194 eligible patients, 57.7% (n = 111) entered the 12-week extension trial [MS + G:74/131, 57.3%; MG + S:37/63, 58.7%) with 55 (51.9%) subjects attaining goal [MS + G:59.2%; MG + S:37.1%] at week 12. The final insulin dosage was similar in both groups [MS + G: 0.46 U/kg; MG + S:0.45 U/kg] with a higher rate of hypoglycemia in the MG + S (6.5 events/patient-year) than the MS + G group (3.2 events/patient-year), although neither group had severe hypoglycemia. Conclusion: In metformin-treated type 2 diabetes patients, high fasting BG predicted greater Al c reductions with the addition of glargine, but not with sitagliptin. In subjects uncontrolled with 6-month dual therapy of MS or MG, 50% attained Al c < 7% with triple therapy of MS + G or MG + Sin 12 weeks.

An integral part of genetic analysis is the isolation of PCR-amplifiable DNA. However, addressing the issue of DNA isolation in animal wildlife research can be challenging due to the wide range of potential biological sources used to obtain DNA. Here, we present a modified silica-based DNA isolation method for obtaining PCR-amplifiable DNA from a wide range of biological sources typically encountered in animal wildlife research. We compared the present method with commonly used non-commercial and commercially available DNA extraction methods. Our results show that DNA yield, quality and purity (as assessed by PCR amplification) are qualitatively comparable, and in many cases even better, than commonly used non-commercial and commercially available DNA extraction methods. We describe the main factors that can affect DNA yield and provide variants of the basic protocol that can be performed according to the DNA source.

It was found that sharing explicit and tacit knowledge correlated with the cultural dimensions of uncertainty avoidance, individualism-collectivism, and paternalism. On the other side, sharing tacit and explicit knowledge did not correlate with the cultural dimensions of power distance and masculinity-femininity. For organizational managers interested in knowledge sharing, a lesson is to facilitate environments of low uncertainty, care about the needs of workers, and have high collective values such as respect and interest in what others do.

We evaluated the effectiveness of inferior petrosal sinus sampling (IPSS) in preoperative tumor lateralization and surgical outcomes. Methods Fifty-two consecutive patients with CD and normal magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) were enrolled between 2009 and 2015. Selective catheterization of petrosal sinuses for IPSS was performed. All patients underwent microsurgical dissection, and if a lesion was found, underwent lesion resection. Demographic, biochemical, and intraoperative findings were prospectively collected and reviewed 6 and 12 months postoperatively. Results Forty-five patients (86.4%) had clear lateralization while seven patients had bilateral elevation. Twenty-two patients (42%) were found to have a macroscopic lesion, defined as an abnormal tissue during microsurgical dissection, which was thus resected. No patient had a lesion larger than 4 mm. Eighty-one percent of patients had the lesion where IPSS had been predicted. Hemi-hypophysectomy was performed on twenty-eight patients based on IPSS findings, since no lesion was found. Eighty-six percent of patients with lesion resection had biochemical remission by 12 months. Biochemical remission was documented in 78 and 71% of patients who underwent hemi-hypophysectomy by 6 and 12 months, respectively.

Utilities can use this approach to incentive or discourage the charge of EVs according to different constraints. In this study, the authors refer the EV clusters or fleets, where there is only one energy buyer for all the clusters. This approach corresponds to an indirect method based on prices to induce behaviours in the management of charging on clusters of EVs. The first actor of the algorithm is an aggregator of EV fleet operators acting as a dealer between the electricity market and consumers. A theoretical game model based on Stackelberg's formulation is proposed to capture the interaction between the fleet operator and the owners/drivers of the EVs. A bi-level optimisation problem arises to represent the game between the agents involved: at the upper level, the aggregator maximises its benefits, while the lower level represents the behaviour of rational drivers as a fleet.

Objective: To evaluate the frequency of mutations in the RdxA nitroreductase in a population of patients with H. pylori-positive gastrointestinal disease. Materials and methods: We amplified the DNA of 170 gastric biopsies by PCR to detect mutations in the RdxA nitroreductase. An analysis of DNA sequences translated into amino acid sequences was done and then compared to the reference strain 26695. Results: The frequency of RdxA nitroreductase mutations in this study population was 78%.

Results: There were 51 patients who underwent laparoscopic nephrectomy with a confirmatory pathology report for IRD. We identified four (8%) major complications; three of them required transfusion and one conversion to open surgery. The mean operative time was 233 +/- 108 min. Mean estimated blood loss was 206 +/- 242 mL excluding the conversion cases and 281 +/- 423 mL including them. The mean length of hospital stay was 3.0 +/- 2.0 days. Conclusion: Laparoscopic nephrectomy for IRD can safely be done. It is a reproducible technique with low risks and complication rates. Our experience supports that releasing the kidney first and leaving the hilum for the end is a safe approach when vascular structures are embedded into a single block of inflammatory and scar tissue.

Deterministic version of the problem has been widely studied. However, this assumption can lead to inaccurate and ineffective decisions. In this research, we tackle the stochastic version of two-echelon inventory system by designing an extension of a well-known heuristic. This research considers customer demands as following a normal density function. A set of 240 random instances was generated and used in evaluating both the deterministic and stochastic solution approaches. Due to the nature of the objective function, evaluation was carried out via Monte Carlo simulation. For variable demand settings, computational experiments shows that: i) the use of average demand to define the inventory policy implies an underestimation of the total cost and ii) the newly proposed method offers cost savings.

Objective: To evaluate the efficacy of prostaglandin analogues for retained placenta. Search strategy: MEDLINE, EMBASE, CENTRAL, ICTRP, LILACS, and OpenSIGLE were searched without language restrictions from inception to January 31, 2017, by combining terms for retained placenta and prostaglandin analogues. Selection criteria: Randomized controlled trials comparing prostaglandin analogues with any other intervention. Data collection and analysis: Trials were independently assessed for inclusion, data extraction, and risk of bias. Data were extracted for meta-analyses. GRADE was used to evaluate the quality of data. Main results: Seven randomized controlled trials (851 patients) were included. Prostaglandins did not increase the placenta expulsion rate (relative risk [RR] 1.40, 95% confidence interval [CI] 0.83-2.36) or decrease maternal transfusion (RR 0.72, 95% CI 0.43-1.22). In comparison with oxytocin, prostaglandins did not modify the expulsion rate (RR 1.26, 95% CI 0.90-1.78), maternal transfusion (RR 1.05, 95% CI 0.27-4.09), or time for delivery of placenta (mean difference -1.56minutes, 95% CI, -9.25-6.13). Three trials comparing prostaglandins with oxytocin agonists, ergometrine, and manual removal reported similar results.

Although many aspects of penetrating chest injuries have been well established, video-assisted thoracoscopy is still finding its place in cardiac box trauma and algorithmic approaches are still lacking. The purpose of this manuscript is to provide a streamlined recommendation for penetrating cardiac box injury in stable patients. Methods: Literature review was carried out using PubMed/ MEDLINE and Google Scholar databases to identify articles describing the characteristics and concepts of penetrating cardiac box trauma, including the characteristics of tamponade, cardiac ultrasound, indications and techniques of pericardial windows and, especially, the role of video-assisted thoracoscopy in stable patients. Results: Penetrating cardiac box injuries, whether by stab or gunshot wounds, require rapid surgical consultation. Unstable patients require immediate open surgery, however, determining which stable patients should be taken to thoracoscopic surgery is still controversial. Here, the classification of penetrating cardiac box injury used in Colombia is detailed, as well as the algorithmic approach to these types of trauma. Conclusion: Although open surgery is mandatory in unstable patients with penetrating cardiac box injuries, a more conservative and minimally invasive approach may be undertaken in stable patients. As rapid decision-making is critical in the trauma bay, surgeons working in high-volume trauma centers should expose themselves to thoracoscopy and always consider this possibility in the setting of penetrating cardiac box injuries in stable patients, always in the context of an experienced trauma team.",Review,"Vinck, E.E.; Angel, E.P.; Barrios, R.V.; Martinez, S.I.; Arias, C.A.; Garzon, J.C.; Ebels, T.; Alzate, S.A.; Fernandez, A.",Wounds; Gunshot; Trauma Centers; Thoracic Injuries; Wounds; Penetraing; Pericardial Window Techniques; Data Management,Wounds;Gunshot;Trauma Centers;Thoracic Injuries;Penetraing;Pericardial Window Techniques;Data Management;PERICARDIAL-EFFUSION;DIAGNOSIS;SURGERY;TRAUMA;MANAGEMENT;TAMPONADE;ECHOCARDIOGRAPHY;ASSOCIATION,Colombia;Netherlands,2-s2.0-85113989905

Material and methods A steering committee and an advisory group of experts in Implant Dentistry were selected among eighteen countries. An open-ended questionnaire by Delphi methodology was validated including 64 questions, divided in 7 topics, concerning the various trends in dental implantology. The survey was conducted in two rounds, which provided the participants in the second round with the results of the first. The questionnaires were completed on August 2020, and the online meeting conference was held on September 2020. The final prediction was developed through consensus by a selected group of experts. Results A total of 197 experts from Latin America answered the first and second questionnaire. In the first round, the established threshold for consensus (65%) was achieved in 30 questions (46.87%). In the second round, performed on average 45 days later, this level was achieved in 47 questions (73.43%). Consensus was completely reached on the item ""Diagnostic"" (100%), the field with the lowest consensus was ""Demand for treatment with dental implants"" (37.5%).

This study aimed to compare the disease outcomes of patients with RA, based on their healthcare regime affiliation. Methods A retrospective observational study of Colombian patients with RA in three outpatient services of different regimes: Contributory (CR, workers and their families with a monthly income above a yearly defined threshold, approximately US$ 220, who allocate a percentage of their income to financing the national health fund and to get access to healthcare services), subsidized (SR, a vulnerable population with a monthly income below the threshold, who have access to healthcare through the national health fund; comparable to the USA Medicaid population), and an excellence clinical care center (C3, access to specialized care, regardless of their healthcare affiliation regime). Data were collected from clinical records for 2 years of follow-up and included demographics, lag times between appointments, and time in high disease activity. We used the Mantel-Cox test for the analysis of time to remission/low disease activity. Results A total of 240 patients were included (80 patients per regime). At the start of follow-up, mean age was 53.7 years; 21.6% of patients were men; 79.6% of patients had established RA; 72.9% of patients had high disease activity. Patients in the CR had longer lag times between scheduled appointments (p < 0.0001). During follow-up, SR had the highest proportion of patients with high disease activity. Survival curve analysis showed no significant difference between SR and CR groups (p = 0.2903), but was significantly different compared with the C3 group (p < 0.0001). Median survival in high disease activity was greater in the SR group (293 days), followed by CR (254 days), and finally by C3 (64 days). Conclusion Patients that were treated in the excellence clinical care center had better outcomes when compared with other regimes. These data support that healthcare regime may influence disease outcome in patients with RA.",Article,"Barahona-Correa, J.E.; Florez-Suarez, J.; Coral-Alvarado, P.; Mendez-Patarroyo, P.; Quintana-Lopez, G.",Healthcare disparities; Insurance; Latin America; Rheumatoid arthritis; Rheumatology,Healthcare disparities;Insurance;Latin America;Rheumatoid arthritis;Rheumatology;TO-TARGET STRATEGY;TREAT;DISEASE;MANAGEMENT;ONSET,Colombia,2-s2.0-85089582604;2-s2.0-85089582604

,,,2,WOS:000613751800003,2021,"Prevalence of CYP2C19 polymorphism in Bogota, Colombia: The first report of allele*17","Introduction Proton pump inhibitors (PPIs) are a group of drugs that are essential for the treatment of acid-related disorders, such as gastroesophageal reflux (GERD), dyspepsia, gastric ulcers and Helicobacter pylori (H. pylori) infection. PPIs such as omeprazole, esomeprazole, pantoprazole and lansoprazole are metabolized by the CYP2C19 enzyme, which is encoded by a polymorphic gene. Four polymorphisms have an impact on the speed of PPI metabolism: CYP2C19*1/*1 (extensive metabolizers), CYP2C19*2/*2 (intermediate metabolizers), CYP2C19*3/*3 (poor metabolizers) and CYP2C19*17/*17 (ultrarapid metabolizers). Extensive and ultrarapid metabolizers inactivate PPIs quickly, which consequently causes low plasma concentrations of PPIs, while intermediate or poor metabolizers have higher plasma concentrations of PPIs and, therefore, PPIs have greater therapeutic efficacy in individuals with these polymorphisms. Objective To determine the frequency of genetic polymorphisms of the CPY2C19 enzyme in Bogota, Colombia. Methods This observational study was conducted in Bogota between 2012 and 2015 and was part of a clinical trial (ID: NCT03650543). It included 239 subjects with dyspepsia, H. pylori infection, or GERD symptoms. CYP2C19 genotyping was performed on gastric biopsy samples. Polymorphisms *1, *2, and *3 were analyzed by real-time PCR (Roche (R)), and PCR-RFLP was used to determine the presence of polymorphism *17. Results The distribution of different types of PPI metabolizers was as follows: extensive (70.7%), ultrarapid (12.9%), intermediate (8.8%) and poor (0.8%). Conclusion The population studied consisted mainly of extensive and ultrarapid PPI metabolizers. These findings show that it is necessary to increase PPI doses in this group of subjects or to use PPIs that are not metabolized by CYP2C19 (rabeprazole). This is the first Colombian work to identify ultrarapid metabolizers.",Article,"Arevalo-Galvis, A.; Otero-Regino, W.A.; Ovalle-Celis, G.N.; Rodriguez-Gomez, E.R.; Trespalacios-Rangel, A.A.",,PROTON-PUMP INHIBITOR;HELICOBACTER-PYLORI ERADICATION;GASTROESOPHAGEAL-REFLUX DISEASE;TRIPLE THERAPY;METABOLISM;OMEPRAZOLE;ESOMEPRAZOLE;MANAGEMENT;SYMPTOMS;GENOTYPE,Colombia,2-s2.0-85100442218

In the visual screening, visual acuity, ocular alignment and the presence of structural ocular anomalies should be assessed. Methods: A literature review about strategies to perform an adequate pediatric visual examination by general physicians and pediatricians for early detection of visual problems in children was carried out. Results: Visual disorders are one of the main causes of disability in children, being the main risk factors uncorrected refractive errors, strabismus and congenital cataracts, that can leave irreversible sequels if they are not detected on time, being those disorders identified through visual screening.

Isolate, identify and molecularly characterize pathogenic Cryptococcus isolates for humans from environmental and clinical samples from the city of Cucuta. Materials and methods. A total of 1300 samples were collected from 446 trees of 10 different species in 10 public areas of Cucuta. Concomitantly, clinical isolates of Cryptococcus neoformans were obtained (June 2016-June 2017). The samples were cultivated in Guizottia abysinica seed medium and were then biochemically identified and characterized by PCR fingerpinting and RFLP of the URA5 gene. Results. C. neoformans displayed an environmental prevalence of 4.3% (19 positive individuals), and that of C. gattii was 0.2% (1 positive individual); this yielded a total of 20 Cryptococcus-positive trees and 21 isolates (two from the same individual). Santander Park registered 47.6% of the global prevalence (10/21 isolates), followed by La Victoria Park with 23.8% (5/21 isolates), corresponding to C. neoformans. One C. gattii isolate was collected from a Ficus benjamina tree located in Mercedes Abrego Park. Genotypic analysis revealed the presence of C. neoformans var. grubii VNI in 85.7% of environmental isolates as well as 100% of clinical isolates.

Despite some differences, similar effectiveness and safety have been proven in several studies for both strategies. However, Spinner et al compared both treatments in 115 renal transplant recipients showing deaths were more likely to occur in patients who received UP. Most of these deaths (2/4 cases) occurred because malignancies developed. This finding is paradoxical because CMV is considered a potentially oncogenic virus and, therefore, UP (a longer therapy compared with the PT) should not be linked with the emergence of a greater number of tumors. New evidence suggests that changes in host immune response triggered by CMV infection may have a mitigating effect on the development of tumors. It is now known CMV infection produces a clonal expansion of gamma delta T lymphocytes which can elicit an aggressive response against neoplastic cells. Currently, UP is the therapy most frequently used in Colombian transplant centers; however, doses administered vary depending on several clinical and laboratory factors. There are no clinical cohorts treated with PT.

In this study of community-living older adults, our objective was to quantify outcome changes following identification and treatment of malnutrition or its risk. Design: Our intervention was a nutritional quality improvement program (QIP). The nutritional QIP included: (i) education of participants about the importance of complete and balanced macro- and micronutrient intake plus physical exercise, (ii) nutritional intervention with dietary counseling; and (iii) provision of oral nutritional supplements (ONS) for daily intake over 60 days. Follow-up measurements took place 30 days after ONS treatment ended, i.e., 90 days after start of intervention. Setting and participants: We recruited 618 transitional-care, chronically ill, older adults ( 60 years) with malnutrition/risk (per Mini Nutrition Assessment-Short Form, MNA-SF) from the outpatient clinic of Hospital Universitario San Ignacio, in Bogota???, Colombia. Methods: For pre-post comparisons, we examined cognition (Mini-Mental State Exam, MMSE), physical abilities (Barthel Activities of Daily Living, ADL; Short Physical Performance Battery, SPPB), affective disorder status (Global Depression Scale, GDS), and quality of life (QoL; EuroQoL-5D-3L, EQ-5D-3L; EuroQoL-Visual Analog Scale, EQ-VAS). Results: Participants were mean age 74.1 ?? 8.7 y, female majority (69.4%), and had an average of 2.6 comorbidities with cardiovascular and respiratory diseases predominant (28.5%).

A strategy map usually contains the strategic objectives of an organization, grouped into four perspectives: (a) finances, (b) clients, (c) internal processes, and (d) growth and learning, all of them linked through cause-effect relationships. The use of quantitative tools, such as multicriteria decision making, has been proposed to model a strategy map and to select the causal relationships to be included. However, no work has been found in the literature to select the strategic objectives to be incorporated into the map. This is the gap that is addressed in this paper. To overcome this gap, the proposed method incorporates a fuzzy multicriteria method known as DEMATEL (decision-making trial and evaluation laboratory) with an optimization model to choose the strategic objectives and their causal relationships. DEMATEL is used to set priorities to the components of the strategy map, whereas the optimization model selects those to be included by producing the appropriate balance between conflicting goals that appear in building a strategy map (minimum amount of relationships among strategic objectives, maximizing the weight of the relationships/objectives selected). As an illustrative case, the method is applied to a higher education institution where expert judgment in this field provided validation of the strategy map designed.",Article,"Lopez-Ospina, H.; Pardo, D.; Rojas, A.; Barros-Castro, R.; Palacio, K.; Quezada, L.",Balanced Scorecard; Fuzzy DEMATEL; Strategy maps; Optimization method,Balanced Scorecard;Fuzzy DEMATEL;Strategy maps;Optimization method;PERFORMANCE EVALUATION;MANAGEMENT;PROPOSAL;MODEL,Colombia;Chile,2-s2.0-85128243714;2-s2.0-85128243714

Methods: This was a retrospective study of patients diagnosed with sciatic nerve entrapment (SNE), ischiofemoral impingement (IFI), and rupture of the proximal origin of the hamstring muscles (RHM) who underwent a hip endoscopy from January 2012 to December 2018, after a minimum of 3 months of conservative management without satisfactory results. Complications were documented and graded using the adapted system of Clavien-Dindo. Revision surgeries were classified as treatment failures. Function was evaluated by the Western Ontario McMaster Universities Osteoarthritis Index before and 12 months after the surgical procedure. Results: A total of 97 hips with subgluteal space pathologies were treated with hip endoscopy. This total consisted of 77 hips with SNE, 5 with IFI, 12 with SNE thorn IFI, and 3 hips with RHM. Minor (Clavien-Dindo I-II) and major (Clavien-Dindo III-V) complications occurred in 7.22% (7) (95% confidence interval 3.54%-14.15%) and 12.37% (12) (95% confidence interval 7.22%-20.39%). Grade II, III, and IV complications were reported in 7.22% (7), 7.22%, and 5.15% (5) hips, respectively. Temporary nerve injury of the sciatic nerve, hematoma, and permanent nerve injury of the posterior femoral cutaneous nerve were the most common grade II, grade III, and grade IV complications, respectively. The revision rate was 6.19% (6) and entrapment of the sciatic nerve was the main cause of reoperation. No statistically significant differences were found between cases with and without complications in the Western Ontario McMaster Universities Osteoarthritis Index scores evaluated before and after surgery (P > .05). Conclusions: A high rate of complications associated with hip endoscopy were observed in patients with SNE, IFI, and RHM.

The aim of this study was to determine diagnostic performance and degree of concordance between the APRI index and liver biopsy for diagnosing cirrhosis in these patients. Material and methods: In a cohort of patients with ALD, the value of the APRI index and liver biopsy results were determined according to the METAVIR score. The AUC and the degree of concordance between an APRI value >2 and a METAVIR score of F4 were evaluated as markers of liver cirrhosis, through a kappa statistic. Results: In total, 70 patients (age 51 +/- 13 years) were included. The most common autoimmune liver diseases were primary biliary cirrhosis (PBC) (40%), autoimmune hepatitis (AIH) (24.3%) and AIH-PBC overlap syndrome (32.9%). Cirrhosis was confirmed by biopsy in 16 patients (22.9%). 15 patients (21.4%) had an APRI index >2 (Cirrhosis) and only six met both criteria. The AUC of the APRI was 0.77 (95% CI 0.65-0.88). The degree of concordance between the tests was low for an APRI cut-off point >2 (kappa 0.213; 95% CI 0.094-0.332), as well as for cut-off points >1.5, >1 and >0.5 (kappa 0.213, 0.255, 0.257, respectively) Conclusion: Our results suggest that there is little concordance between APRI and liver biopsyfor the diagnosis of cirrhosis in patients with ALD. It should therefore not be used as a single diagnostic method to determine cirrhosis. (C) 2020 Elsevier Espana, S.L.U.

Therefore, pre-processing to correct these anomalies is required to improve the analysis of monitoring data. The aim of this study is to propose a method to detect outliers as well as to fill-in the gaps in time series. Method: Outliers are detected using Winsorising procedure and the application of the Discrete Fourier Transform (DFT) and the Inverse of Fast Fourier Transform (IFFT) to complete the time series. Together, these tools were used to analyse a case study comprising three sites in Colombia ((i) Bogota D.C. Salitre-WWTP (Waste Water Treatment Plant), influent; (ii) Bogota D.C. Gibraltar Pumping Station (GPS); and, (iii) Itagui, San Fernando-WWTP, influent (Medellin metropolitan area)) analysed via UV-Vis (Ultraviolet and Visible) spectra. Results: Outlier detection with the proposed method obtained promising results when window parameter values are small and self-similar, despite that the three time series exhibited different sizes and behaviours. The DFT allowed to process different length gaps having missing values. To assess the validity of the proposed method, continuous subsets (a section) of the absorbance time series without outlier or missing values were removed from the original time series obtaining an average 12% error rate in the three testing time series. Conclusions: The application of the DFT and the IFFT using the 10% most important harmonics of useful values, can be advantageous for its later use in different applications, specifically for time series of water quality and quantity in urban sewer systems. One potential application would be the analysis of dry weather affecting rainy seasons, a feature achieved by detecting values that correspond to unusual behaviour in a time series. Additionally, the results hint at the potential of the method in correcting other hydrologic time series.",Article,"Plazas-Nossa, L.; Avila, M.A.; Torres, A.",Imputing missing values; outlier detection; UV-vis absorbance; water quality; winsorizing,Imputing missing values;outlier detection;UV-vis absorbance;water quality;winsorizing;SYSTEMS;LOADS;ALGORITHMS;PARAMETERS;MANAGEMENT;IMPUTATION;CATCHMENT;NETWORKS;DYNAMICS;WEATHER,Colombia,

The primary objective was to describe the frequency of dyslipidaemias. The secondary objectives were: frequency of cardiovascular comorbidity, statins and other lipid lowering drugs use, frequency of statins intolerance, percentage of patients achieving c-LDL goals, and distribution of cardiovascular risk (CVR). Materials and methods: Cross-sectional study with retrospective data collection from 461 patients diagnosed with dyslipidaemia and treated in 17 highly specialised centres distributed into six geographic and economic regions of Colombia. Results: Mean (SD) age was 66.4 ( 12.3) years and 53.4% (246) were women. Dyslipidaemias were distributed as follows in order of frequency: mixed dystipidaemia (51.4%), hypercholesterolaemia (41.0%), hypertriglyceridaemia (5.4%), familial hypercholesterolaemia (3.3%), and low c-HDL (0.7%). The most prescribed drugs were atorvastatin (75.7%) followed by rosuvastatin (24.9%). As for lipid control, 55% of all patients, and 28.6% of those with coronary heart disease, did not achieve their personal c-LDL goal despite treatment. The frequency of statin intolerance was 2.6% in this study. Conclusions: Mixed dyslipidaemia and hypercholesterolaemia are the most frequent dyslipidaemias in Colombia. A notable percentage of patients under treatment with lipid -lowering drugs, including those with coronary heart disease, did not achieve specific c-LDL goals. This poor lipid control may worsen patient's CVR, so that therapeutic strategies need to be changed, either with statin intensification or addition of new drugs in patients with higher CVR. 2020 Sociedad Espanola de Arteriosclerosis.

Thus, the aim of this Delphi study was to predict the future trends in the diagnosis and treatment of peri-implant diseases and conditions in LA countries for the year 2030. Methods A Latin American steering committee and group of experts in implant dentistry validated a questionnaire including 64 questions divided into eight sections. The questionnaire was run twice with an interval of 45 days, with the results from the first round made available to all the participants in the second round. The results were expressed in percentages and data was analyzed describing the consensus level reached in each question. Results A total of 221 experts were invited to participate in the study and a total 214 (96.8%) completed the two rounds. Moderate (65%-85%) to high consensus (>= 85%) was reached in 51 questions (79.69%), except in the questions dealing with ""prevalence"", where no consensus was reached. High and moderate consensus was attained for all the questions in three fields (risk factors and indicators, diagnosis and treatment of peri-implant conditions and deficiencies, and prevention and maintenance).

,,,1,WOS:000744286500035,2021,Inguinal lymph node density as a powerful predictor of cancer specific survival in patients with node-positive penile cancer,"Introduction: Penile cancer (PC) is an aggressive malignancy in which the most important prognostic factor for cancer specific survival (CSS) is the involvement of regional lymph nodes (LNs). Lymph node density (LND) could become a superior prognostic tool for CSS, by accounting for both extent of dissection and nodal disease burden. We aim to validate LND as a prognostic factor for CSS in a contemporary series of patients with PC treated and followed at a single high-volume center, treating more than 25 PC patients per year, over a 13-year period. Methods: Clinical charts of all patients with PC who underwent surgical treatment between 2007 and 2020 were reviewed. Clinicopathological data was collected and analyzed retrospectively. We only included patients with >= 8 LNs removed in a unilateral ILND or >= 16 LNs when a bilateral approach was used. We attempted to find an optimal threshold for LND, capable of maximizing effect difference in terms of CSS and RFS between dichotomized groups. To determine this threshold, we used the chi-squared and the Mann-Whitney tests, and it was required to fulfill the proportional hazards assumption. We assessed different thresholds previously reported in the literature. In our study the optimal threshold for LND was determined to be <= 20%y Descriptive statistics were used to summarize patient characteristics, CSS and RFS were graphically represented by Kaplan-Meier estimates. Harrell's C index for CSS and RFS were calculated for LND and pN stage, to determine which variable has a superior predictive capacity Results: We identified 110 patients with PC who underwent ILND at our institution, of these, 87 were node-positive and were included in the final analysis. Overall estimates of CSS showed a 3-year CSS of 43% (95% CI: 32-54), the estimated 3-year CSS for the patients with a LND <= 20% was 69% (95% CI: 50-82) and 26% (95% CI: 14-39) in the group with a LND >20% (Log-rank P = 0.001). The estimated 3year RFS for the patients with LND <= 20% was 61% (95% CI: 42-76) and 30% (95% CI: 16-44) in the group with a LND >20% (Log-rank P = 0.009). The results of univariate analysis indicate that in patients with a LND >20% the risk for cancer specific mortality was increased (HR 2.68; 95% CI: 1.45-4.98, P = 0.002) compared with LND <= 20%. In the and Cox multivariate analysis after Adjusting for age and pN stage the association increased (HR 2.73; 95%, CI 1.38-5.40, P = 0.004). Harrell's C index for CSS was 0.63 for LND vs. 0.54 for pN stage, suggesting a 9% higher concordance for LND and CSS. Conclusions: Lymph node density stands as a promising tool for risk-stratifying patients with node-positive PC after ILND. In this retrospective study, LND was a significant predictor of CSS and RFS when using a LND >20% threshold, and also showed a superior predictive ability than pN stage. These results support the use of the LND parameter in clinical practice with a final goal to improve risk stratification, and individualized adjuvant treatment decision-making to patients with high-risk of cancer specific mortality.

This study aimed to identify and describe the current organization and practices of the IF teams in Latin America and the Caribbean. An online survey was sent to inquire about the existence of IF teams that managed children on home parenteral nutrition (HPN). Our questionnaire was based on a previously published European study with a similar goal. Twenty-four centers with pediatric IF teams in eight countries completed the survey, representing a total number of 316 children on HPN. The median number of children on parenteral nutrition (PN) at home per team was 5.5 (range 1-50). Teams consisted of the following members: pediatric gastroenterologist and a pediatric surgeon in all teams, dietician (95.8%), nurse (91.7%), social worker (79.2%), pharmacist (70.8%), oral therapist (62.5%), psychologist (58.3%), and physiotherapist (45.8%).

Methods We reviewed Wilms' tumours (WTs) between 2000 and 2018, capturing computed tomography images at baseline, after neoadjuvant chemotherapy (NaC) and postoperatively. Images were uploaded into MATLAB-3-D volumetric image processing software. The program was trained by two clinicians who supervised the demarcation of tumour and parenchyma, followed by automatic recognition and delineation of tumour margins on serial imaging, and differentiation from uninvolved renal parenchyma. Volume was automatically calculated for both. Results During the study period, 98 patients were identified. Of these, based on image quality and availability, 32 (38 affected moieties) were selected. Most patients (65%) were girls, diagnosed at age 50 +/- 37 months of age. NaC was employed in 64% of patients. Surgical management included 27 radical and 11 partial nephrectomies. Automated volume assessment demonstrated objective response to NaC for unilateral and bilateral tumours (68 +/- 20% and 53 +/- 39%, respectively), as well as preservation on uninvolved parenchyma with partial nephrectomy (70 +/- 46 cm(3) at presentation to 57 +/- 41 cm(3) post-surgery). Conclusion Volumetric analysis is feasible and allows objective assessment of tumour and parenchyma volume in response to chemotherapy and surgery.

Flexion-adduction forces across the first ray is the result from imbalance between intrinsic and extrinsic muscles. Multiples surgeries have been devised for the treatment of this condition such as contracture release and by tendon transfers for balancing the muscles forces. We report the results of a less demanding surgical technique, intended to avoid hyperextension of the metacarpophalangeal joint previously described in other series. Methods: Five patients with cerebral palsy who underwent a surgical correction for their thumb-in-palm deformity between January 2013 and August 2014 were included. All patients were assessed postoperatively with a minimum follow up of six months. Three criteria were chosen to evaluate functional ability: capacity to perform pinch, volitional muscle control and usefulness of the hand in daily life activities. Results: Patients who had surgery for spastic thumb deformity were reviewed. The thumb was maintained out of the palm in all patients. Three patients were able to perform correct pinch, achieved volitional muscle control and a more functional hand. One patient had limitation to achieve one of the evaluated daily life activities and one patient lacked active thumb movement for pinch, motor control and achieved no daily life activities.

Therefore, this study aims to identify the antecedents of corporate reputation from the perspective of internal interest groups in four sections of a Colombian Savings and Credit Cooperative. To achieve the purpose, a qualitative study was carried out, in which seven focus groups made up of managers, workers and members of the Board of Directors participated. To analyze the information obtained, a thematic content analysis was carried out in two moments and three phases. The obtained results show that the antecedents of the corporate reputation identified by the participants in the study are: 1) the quality of the services provided (opportunity, personalized service and warmth of care), 2) the organizational culture, related to family dynamics and the cooperative values that underlie it and 3) the appropriation of organizational identity, which includes the definition of the associate's profile and the sense of belonging.

Methods: This retrospective study included 38 patients who esophageal functional reconstruction using radial forearm or ALT flap at our center between February 2010 and December 2017. Results: Mean age was 51 years. About 80% of the included patients were females. Laryngoesophageal defects were present in 80%. Total circumferential reconstruction was required in 60% of patients. Brachial-radial grafts were performed in 26% and anterolateral thigh flaps in 74%. Overall, early complication rate was 30%, which 20% were fistulae (brachial-radial, 2.8%; ALT free flap, 8.3%). Late complications (20%) included stenosis and distal graft lumen obstruction. Only 10% of patients were unable to tolerate oral feeding and 50% of this patient needed permanent gastrostomy. Regarding oncological follow-up during the 24-month post-operative, no tumor recurrence was observed. Conclusions: Functional outcomes of reconstruction with brachial-radial and ALT flap were satisfying. Our findings suggest that ALT has a lower incidence of post-operative complications than radial forearm flap. The choice of the type of flap will depend on the size and location of the defect. Small and partially covered defects benefit from the use of a radial flap, and for larger and circumferential pharyngeal reconstructions with possible radiotherapy requirements, they benefit from an ALT flap.",Article,"Moreno, A.; Cabrera, L.F.; Pedraza, M.; Rojas, A.; Lopez, P.; Sanchez, S.; Gomez, M.A.; Correa, S.",Esophageal; Reconstruction; Pharyngocervical,Esophageal;Reconstruction;Pharyngocervical;ISLAND FLAP;NECK;HEAD;MANAGEMENT,Colombia,2-s2.0-85112447428

Deciding on surgical restoration of the alignment or cast immobilization without reducing the fracture is a complex concern given the remodeling potential of bones in children. In addition, the lack of evidence-based safe boundaries of shortening and angulation, that will not jeopardize upper-extremity functionality in the future, further complicates this decision. Objective: The authors aim to measure functional outcomes, assessed using the Patient-Reported Outcomes Measurement Information System (PROMIS) Pediatric Physical Function v2.0 instrument. The authors hypothesize that outcomes will not be worse in children treated with cast immobilization in situ compared with those treated with closed reduction with or without percutaneous fixation. The authors also aim to compare the following as secondary outcomes: ulnar variance and fracture alignment in the sagittal and coronal planes, range of motion, pressure ulcers, pain control, radius osteotomy due to deformity, pseudoarthrosis cure, and remanipulation. Methods: This is the protocol of a randomized noninferiority trial comparing upper-extremity functionality in children aged 5 to 10 years, after sustaining a distal radius fracture, treated with either cast immobilization in situ or closed reduction with or without fixation in a single orthopedic hospital. Functional follow-up is projected at 6 months, while clinical and radiographic follow-up will occur at 2 weeks, 3 months, and 9 months. Results: Recruitment commenced in July 2021. As of January 2022, 23 children have been randomized. Authors expect an average of 5 patients to be recruited monthly; therefore, recruitment and analysis should be complete by October 2024.

To evaluate the cost-effectiveness of azathioprine, fixed-schedule rituximab, and tailored-dose rituximab for ANCA-associated systemic vasculitis. Methods: A Markov model from the perspective of the Colombian healthcare systemwas designed with annual cycles and a 5- year time horizon, charting the following states: remission, minor relapse, major relapse, and death. The discount rate was 5%. Transition probabilities were obtained from a systematic literature review. The costs (1 US dollar = 2956 Colombian pesos in 2018) were estimated based on national drug registries and official fee manuals for procedures, along with other resources. The main outcomes were quality-adjusted life-years (QALYs) taken from the Tufts registry. Univariate and multivariate sensitivity analyses were performed. Results: Final costs were $1446 for azathioprine, $4898 for tailored-dose rituximab, and $6311 for fixed-schedule rituximab. QALYs gained were 3.18, 4.08, and 3.98, respectively. Rituximab was cost-effective (cost per incremental QALY gained: $4919, and $6865), and tailored-dose administration had a lower cost. Sensitivity analyses did not affect the results.

Statistics show worrying figures worldwide, diagnosed an estimated 1.6 million people with DM by 2025. In this sense, alternative and automated methods are necessary to detect DM, allowing it to take the pertinent measures in its treatment and avoid critical complications, such as the diabetic foot. On the other hand, foot thermography is a promising tool that allows visualization of thermal patterns, patterns that are altered as a consequence of shear and friction associated with lower limb neuropathy. Based on these considerations, we explored different strategies to detect patients with DM from foot thermography in this research. Initially, the study focused on finding a classification index like Thermal Change Index (TCI). Subsequently, we used the deep convolutional neural networks paradigm, implementing 12 different data augmentation methods, of which four are conventional, and 8 are newly proposed methods. The results showed that the proposed and the conventional methods increased the network's performance, where a 100% detection was achieved by weighting the DM probability percentages for both images of the feet.

Here, we investigated the risk of frailty in de novo PD patients and its association with subsequent development of dementia. Methods: We conducted a three-year longitudinal population-based study of 192 drug-naive newly diagnosed PD patients and 172 controls (No-PD) matched for age, sex, and education. Frailty was measured using the frailty index (FI). Logistic regression models, adjusting for potential confounders, were conducted to assess the association between frailty at the time of PD diagnosis and the subsequent odds for developing PD dementia during follow-up. Results: The mean baseline FI score was higher in the PD (0.21 +/- 0.10) than in the No-PD group (0.11 +/- 0.07, p < 0.001). One-third of PD patients had high-FI (>0,25), compared to 5% in the no-PD group.

Objetive: To provide the first guideline on the best time to start enzyme replacement therapy to treat classic Fabry disease, based on the knowledge and experience of experts from ten Latin American countries: Argentina, Brazil, Colombia, Costa Rica, Chile, Ecuador, Mexico, Peru, Uruguay and Venezuela. Methods: The project coordinator designed a survey based on the criteria for starting the treatment which are established in different international guidelines published to date. This document was later sent to all the participants for its evaluation. Results: Fifty experts responded to the survey, whose criteria was divided into 5 sections according to specialty, and they arrived at a consensus. Discussion: The criteria for an early treatment were defined given the growing evidence of a better response and prognosis associated with it. Conclusion: We believe that the importance of this guideline relies on the participation of experts from ten Latin American countries.

In-person lectures and seminars were migrated online using telepresence tools; whilst hand-on professional training and supervised practice were staged and performed in reduced groups to comply with person-to-person distancing policies to contain the spread of the virus. This was particularly challenging as the program makes emphasis on constructivist learning and social engagement. After six months, the effects of changes in lecturing were assessed through a poll which showed that there was widespread acceptance within the whole academic community. Particularly it was observed that use of remote presence tools enhanced engagement, improved knowledge appropriation and allowed for more flexibility.

The impact of the dose intensity administered in consolidation in Latin America is unknown. This study aimed to evaluate the relative dose intensity (RDI) in consolidation and its impact in overall survival.Methods. A retrospective study of 86 patients with AML who were diagnosed between 2010 and 2016 with a 2-year follow-up in a fourth-level Colombian hospital was carried out. Clinical characteristics were reported, Kaplan-Meier was used for estimating the overall survival, and Cox regression was used for multivariate analysis.Results. The median overall survival (OS) was 20.83 months, and the median event-free survival (EFS) was 16.83 months. 64.3% of the patients achieved remission after the7+3chemotherapy induction treatment. Patients under 30 years of age, with white blood cell counts less than 100.000 cells/mm3 who responded to induction treatment had a better OS. Additionally, patients receiving an RDI greater than 0.75 of the planned consolidation dose had better survival. The prognostic variables with impact in the OS were the leukocyte count in peripheral blood at diagnosis, the RDI in consolidation treatment with HIDAC and the response obtained after induction.Conclusion.

The Ci??naga receives fresh water from rivers descending from the Sierra Nevada de Santa Marta. Changes in the water dynamics of these rivers since the early twentieth century have been causing serious social and ecological changes in the region. The Aracataca river is one of these rivers that showed a drastic change in its water availability. In this research we study the relation between cooperation and hydrological dynamics that shapes the water governance system in this basin. The study combines quantitative data obtained from the hydrological description and qualitative information derived from interviews and a role-playing game workshop, which was analyzed from a social-ecological perspective. The analysis shows that the historical management of water, characterized by conflicts between individual and collective interests, power asymmetries, and the heterogeneity between actors, has established a problematic scenario. Our analysis at river basin scale showed difficulties in water governance regardless of water annual variability, thus requiring structural changes that allow the development of coordinated processes toward collective action.

Consequently, to enhance the performance of energy systems, algorithms to support planning decisions are required. This article proposes a simulation-optimization framework to solve the stochastic version of the integrated energy dispatch and unit commitment problem for a solar radiation system operating in non-interconnected zones. Our study was motivated by challenges faced by a rural school located in Cundinamarca, Colombia. Particularly, a simulation with optimization-based iterations approach is used, modeling solar radiation as a random variable. The optimization phase uses a heuristic procedure that enables good solutions to be found in short computational times. To test our method, computational experiments were conducted using a set of randomly generated cases. The results suggest that our approach is useful and able to handle the random nature of the process for the school ""Volcanes"". Additionally, we were able to quantify the impact that using a deterministic approach has on service levels for such systems.

Renal graft intolerance syndrome is an inflammatory process that occurs in up to 40% of patients with graft loss. It is characterized by fever, graft pain, hematuria, and anemia. Traditionally, the treatment has been nephrectomy; however, this procedure is associated with high morbidity and mortality rates. As an alternative, graft embolization is associated with success rates of up to 92%. In this study, we describe the graft embolization experience of 1 center, its clinical outcomes and complications. Methods. An observational, retrospective study was conducted. It included all patients with graft intolerance syndrome undergoing graft embolization between 2012 and 2018. The success of the procedure was defined by the resolution of the symptoms that motivated the embolization. Results. We found 12 cases of patients undergoing embolization. The time of presentation of the graft intolerance syndrome after admission to dialysis was 6 months (range, 0.6-13). The main clinical manifestation was pain in the area of the graft and macroscopic hematuria. Except for 1 patient, all continued with the immunosuppressive treatment regimen after graft loss for 4 months (range, 0.6-9), received antibiotics for 5.5 days (range, 2-14), and 10 patients received steroid treatment for 6.5 days (range, 5-10). The main complication, secondary to the procedure, was hematoma at the puncture site in 3 patients. Only 1 patient had postembolization syndrome, which resolved with steroid administration. Two patients required postembolization nephrectomy due to persistent renal blood flow and symptoms such as pain and hematuria. The average hospital stay was 5.5 days (range, 1-24). Conclusions. Renal graft embolization is an effective technique as a treatment strategy in patients with clinical signs of intolerance syndrome, with a success rate >= 83.3%, low morbidity, and short hospital stay; furthermore, it avoids the potential complications of a surgical nephrectomy. Graft infection should be ruled out before embolization, and the use of prophylactic antibiotics and steroid therapy is recommended to reduce the risk of postembolization syndrome and infectious complications.y",Article,"Garcia-Padilla, P.K.; Afanador, D.; Gonzalez, C.G.; Yucuma, D.; Uribe, J.; Romero, A.",,NEPHRECTOMY;ALLOGRAFT;EFFICACY;MANAGEMENT;SAFETY,Colombia,2-s2.0-85081690198

This work proposes to perform spectral estimation using the Box-Cox transformation and differentiation in order to obtain stationary multivariate time series in a wide sense. Additionally, Principal Component Analysis (PCA) is applied to reduce their dimensionality. Method: Three different UV-Vis absorbance time series for different Colombian locations were studied: (i) El- Salitre Wastewater Treatment Plant (WWTP) in Bogota; (ii) Gibraltar Pumping Station (GPS) in Bogota; and (iii) San-Fernando WWTP in ItagtiI. Each UV-Vis absorbance time series had equal sample number (5705). The estimation of the spectral power density is obtained using the average of modified periodograms with rectangular window and an overlap of 50 %, with the 20 most important harmonics from the Discrete Fourier Transform (DFT) and Inverse Fast Fourier Transform (IFFT). Results: Absorbance time series dimensionality reduction using PCA, resulted in 6, 8 and 7 principal components for each study site respectively, altogether explaining more than 97 % of their variability. Values of differences below 30 % for the UV range were obtained for the three study sites, while for the visible range the maximum differences obtained were: (i) 35 % for El-Salitre WWTP; (ii) 61 % for GPS; and (iii) 75 % for San-Fernando WWTP. Conclusions: The Box-Cox transformation and the differentiation process applied to the UV-Vis absorbance time series for the study sites (El-Salitre, GPS and San-Fernando), allowed to reduce variance and to eliminate tendency of the time series.

Key Results 426 patients were recruited, 31.2% and 41.5% being referred exclusively for dysphagia and GERD symptoms, respectively. Both BEDQ and ES were independently associated with achalasia. Only BEDQ was independently associated with being referred for dysphagia and with relevant HRM findings. ROC curve analysis for achalasia diagnosis showed AUC of 0.809 for BEDQ and 0.765 for ES, with the main difference being higher BEDQ sensitivity (80.0% vs 70.8% for ES). GERDQ independently predicted ES but not BEDQ. In the absence of dysphagia (BEDQ = 0), GERD symptoms significantly determine ES. Conclusions and Inferences Our study suggests both the BEDQ and ES can complementarily describe symptomatic burden in achalasia. BEDQ has several advantages over the ES in the dysphagia evaluation, basically due to its higher sensitivity for manometric diagnosis and independence of GERD symptoms. ES should be used as an achalasia-specific metric, while BEDQ is a better symptom-generic evaluating tool.",Article,"Cisternas, D.; Taft, T.; Carlson, D.A.; Glasinovic, E.; Monrroy, H.; Rey, P.; Hani, A.; Ardila-Hani, A.; Leguizamo, A.M.; Bilder, C.; Ditaranto, A.; Varela, A.; Agotegaray, J.; Remes-Troche, J.M.; de Leon, A.R.; de la Serna, J.P.; Marin, I.; Serra, J.",achalasia; Brief Esophageal Dysphagia Questionnaire; dysphagia evaluation; Eckardt score,achalasia;Brief Esophageal Dysphagia Questionnaire;dysphagia evaluation;Eckardt score;GASTROESOPHAGEAL-REFLUX DISEASE;PERORAL ENDOSCOPIC MYOTOMY;VALIDATION;DIAGNOSIS;GERDQ;MANAGEMENT;DISORDERS,Chile;United States;Colombia;Argentina;Mexico;Spain,2-s2.0-85111870027;2-s2.0-85111870027

The effect of auto-correlated and heteroskedastic errors in measured time-series over the estimated probability density function (PDF) of different environmental indicators is analyzed for a wide variety of possible error structures in the data. For this purpose, multiple correlation-covariance structures are randomly generated from exploring the parametric space of a linear exponent autoregressive (LEAR) model, employing a Bayesian-based Markov Chain Monte Carlo sampling technique. Significant differences tests are proposed to identify the most correlated parameters of the correlation-covariance error model with statistics of the environmental indicator PDFs. The method is applied to total suspended solids (TSS) and chemical oxygen demand (COD) time-series recorded during 13 rainfall events at the inlet and outlet of a SUDS train (stormwater settling tank-horizontal constructed wetland). In this case, results showed that the total error in the estimation of the analyzed environmental indicators is mostly explained by standard uncertainties (flattening of the PDFs) rather than bias contributions (displacement of the PDFs). The correlation-covariance model parameters related to the temporal delimitation of hydrographs/pollutographs and the intensity of the autocorrelation showed to have the strongest influence in the propagation of measurement errors (flattening/displacement of the PDFs).",Article,"Pena-Heredia, F.; Sandoval, S.; Escobar-Vargas, J.A.; Torres, A.",Auto-correlated errors; Autocovariance matrix; Bayesian-MCMC methods; Noisy time-series; Positive definite matrix; Water quality metrology,Auto-correlated errors;Autocovariance matrix;Bayesian-MCMC methods;Noisy time-series;Positive definite matrix;Water quality metrology;WATER-QUALITY;PERFORMANCE;FRAMEWORK;DESIGN;RELIABILITY;MANAGEMENT;REMOVAL;SYSTEMS;SEWERS;LOADS,Colombia,2-s2.0-85106646893

The Global Burden of Disease (GBD) studies done in 1990 and 2000 have been the only studies to quantify non-fatal health outcomes across an exhaustive set of disorders at the global and regional level. Neither effort quantified uncertainty in prevalence or years lived with disability (YLDs). Methods Of the 291 diseases and injuries in the GBD cause list, 289 cause disability. For 1160 sequelae of the 289 diseases and injuries, we undertook a systematic analysis of prevalence, incidence, remission, duration, and excess mortality. Sources included published studies, case notification, population-based cancer registries, other disease registries, antenatal clinic serosurveillance, hospital discharge data, ambulatory care data, household surveys, other surveys, and cohort studies. For most sequelae, we used a Bayesian meta-regression method, DisMod-MR, designed to address key limitations in descriptive epidemiological data, including missing data, inconsistency, and large methodological variation between data sources. For some disorders, we used natural history models, geospatial models, back-calculation models (models calculating incidence from population mortality rates and case fatality), or registration completeness models (models adjusting for incomplete registration with health-system access and other covariates). Disability weights for 220 unique health states were used to capture the severity of health loss. YLDs by cause at age, sex, country, and year levels were adjusted for comorbidity with simulation methods. We included uncertainty estimates at all stages of the analysis. Findings Global prevalence for all ages combined in 2010 across the 1160 sequelae ranged from fewer than one case per 1 million people to 350 000 cases per 1 million people. Prevalence and severity of health loss were weakly correlated (correlation coefficient -0.37). In 2010, there were 777 million YLDs from all causes, up from 583 million in 1990. The main contributors to global YLDs were mental and behavioural disorders, musculoskeletal disorders, and diabetes or endocrine diseases. The leading specific causes of YLDs were much the same in 2010 as they were in 1990: low back pain, major depressive disorder, iron-deficiency anaemia, neck pain, chronic obstructive pulmonary disease, anxiety disorders, migraine, diabetes, and falls. Age-specific prevalence of YLDs increased with age in all regions and has decreased slightly from 1990 to 2010. Regional patterns of the leading causes of YLDs were more similar compared with years of life lost due to premature mortality. Neglected tropical diseases, HIV/AIDS, tuberculosis, malaria, and anaemia were important causes of YLDs in sub-Saharan Africa. Interpretation Rates of YLDs per 100 000 people have remained largely constant over time but rise steadily with age. Population growth and ageing have increased YLD numbers and crude rates over the past two decades. Prevalences of the most common causes of YLDs, such as mental and behavioural disorders and musculoskeletal disorders, have not decreased. Health systems will need to address the needs of the rising numbers of individuals with a range of disorders that largely cause disability but not mortality. Quantification of the burden of non-fatal health outcomes will be crucial to understand how well health systems are responding to these challenges. Effective and affordable strategies to deal with this rising burden are an urgent priority for health systems in most parts of the world.",Article,"Vos, T.; Flaxman, A.D.; Naghavi, M.; Lozano, R.; Michaud, C.;

,,,1483,WOS:000410630000005,2017,"Global, regional, and national disability-adjusted life-years (DALYs) for 333 diseases and injuries and healthy life expectancy (HALE) for 195 countries and territories, 1990-2016: a systematic analysis for the Global Burden of Disease Study 2016","Background Measurement of changes in health across locations is useful to compare and contrast changing epidemiological patterns against health system performance and identify specific needs for resource allocation in research, policy development, and programme decision making. Using the Global Burden of Diseases, Injuries, and Risk Factors Study 2016, we drew from two widely used summary measures to monitor such changes in population health: disability-adjusted life-years (DALYs) and healthy life expectancy (HALE). We used these measures to track trends and benchmark progress compared with expected trends on the basis of the Socio-demographic Index (SDI). Methods We used results from the Global Burden of Diseases, Injuries, and Risk Factors Study 2016 for all-cause mortality, cause-specific mortality, and non-fatal disease burden to derive HALE and DALYs by sex for 195 countries and territories from 1990 to 2016. We calculated DALYs by summing years of life lost and years of life lived with disability for each location, age group, sex, and year. We estimated HALE using age-specific death rates and years of life lived with disability per capita. We explored how DALYs and HALE differed from expected trends when compared with the SDI: the geometric mean of income per person, educational attainment in the population older than age 15 years, and total fertility rate. Findings The highest globally observed HALE at birth for both women and men was in Singapore, at 75.2 years (95% uncertainty interval 71.9-78.6) for females and 72.0 years (68.8-75.1) for males. The lowest for females was in the Central African Republic (45.6 years [42.0-49.5]) and for males was in Lesotho (41.5 years [39.0-44.0]). From 1990 to 2016, global HALE increased by an average of 6.24 years (5.97-6.48) for both sexes combined. Global HALE increased by 6.04 years (5.74-6.27) for males and 6.49 years (6.08-6.77) for females, whereas HALE at age 65 years increased by 1.78 years (1.61-1.93) for males and 1.96 years (1.69-2.13) for females. Total global DALYs remained largely unchanged from 1990 to 2016 (-2.3% [-5.9 to 0.9]), with decreases in communicable, maternal, neonatal, and nutritional (CMNN) disease DALYs offset by increased DALYs due to non-communicable diseases (NCDs). The exemplars, calculated as the five lowest ratios of observed to expected age-standardised DALY rates in 2016, were Nicaragua, Costa Rica, the Maldives, Peru, and Israel. The leading three causes of DALYs globally were ischaemic heart disease, cerebrovascular disease, and lower respiratory infections, comprising 16.1% of all DALYs. Total DALYs and age-standardised DALY rates due to most CMNN causes decreased from 1990 to 2016. Conversely, the total DALY burden rose for most NCDs; however, age-standardised DALY rates due to NCDs declined globally. Interpretation At a global level, DALYs and HALE continue to show improvements. At the same time, we observe that many populations are facing growing functional health loss. Rising SDI was associated with increases in cumulative years of life lived with disability and decreases in CMNN DALYs offset by increased NCD DALYs. Relative compression of morbidity highlights the importance of continued health interventions, which has changed in most locations in pace with the gross domestic product per person, education, and family planning. The analysis of DALYs and HALE and their relationship to SDI represents a robust framework with which to benchmark location-specific health performance. Country-specific drivers of disease burden, particularly for causes with higher-than-expected DALYs, should inform health policies, health system improvement initiatives, targeted prevention efforts, and development assistance for health, including financial and research investments for all countries, regardless of their level of sociodemographic development. The presence of countries that substantially outperform others suggests the need for increased scrutiny for proven examples of best practices, which can help to extend gains, whereas the presence of underperforming countries suggests the need for devotion of extra attention to health systems that need more robust support.

,,,1320,WOS:000385285000009,2016,"Global, regional, and national disability-adjusted life-years (DALYs) for 315 diseases and injuries and healthy life expectancy (HALE), 1990-2015: a systematic analysis for the Global Burden of Disease Study 2015","Background Healthy life expectancy (HALE) and disability-adjusted life-years (DALYs) provide summary measures of health across geographies and time that can inform assessments of epidemiological patterns and health system performance, help to prioritise investments in research and development, and monitor progress toward the Sustainable Development Goals (SDGs). We aimed to provide updated HALE and DALYs for geographies worldwide and evaluate how disease burden changes with development. Methods We used results from the Global Burden of Diseases, Injuries, and Risk Factors Study 2015 (GBD 2015) for all-cause mortality, cause-specific mortality, and non-fatal disease burden to derive HALE and DALYs by sex for 195 countries and territories from 1990 to 2015. We calculated DALYs by summing years of life lost (YLLs) and years of life lived with disability (YLDs) for each geography, age group, sex, and year. We estimated HALE using the Sullivan method, which draws from age-specific death rates and YLDs per capita. We then assessed how observed levels of DALYs and HALE differed from expected trends calculated with the Socio-demographic Index (SDI), a composite indicator constructed from measures of income per capita, average years of schooling, and total fertility rate. Findings Total global DALYs remained largely unchanged from 1990 to 2015, with decreases in communicable, neonatal, maternal, and nutritional (Group 1) disease DALYs off set by increased DALYs due to non-communicable diseases (NCDs). Much of this epidemiological transition was caused by changes in population growth and ageing, but it was accelerated by widespread improvements in SDI that also correlated strongly with the increasing importance of NCDs. Both total DALYs and age-standardised DALY rates due to most Group 1 causes significantly decreased by 2015, and although total burden climbed for the majority of NCDs, age-standardised DALY rates due to NCDs declined. Nonetheless, age-standardised DALY rates due to several high-burden NCDs (including osteoarthritis, drug use disorders, depression, diabetes, congenital birth defects, and skin, oral, and sense organ diseases) either increased or remained unchanged, leading to increases in their relative ranking in many geographies. From 2005 to 2015, HALE at birth increased by an average of 2.9 years (95% uncertainty interval 2.9-3.0) for men and 3.5 years (3.4-3.7) for women, while HALE at age 65 years improved by 0.85 years (0.78-0.92) and 1.2 years (1.1-1.3), respectively. Rising SDI was associated with consistently higher HALE and a somewhat smaller proportion of life spent with functional health loss; however, rising SDI was related to increases in total disability. Many countries and territories in central America and eastern sub-Saharan Africa had increasingly lower rates of disease burden than expected given their SDI. At the same time, a subset of geographies recorded a growing gap between observed and expected levels of DALYs, a trend driven mainly by rising burden due to war, interpersonal violence, and various NCDs. Interpretation Health is improving globally, but this means more populations are spending more time with functional health loss, an absolute expansion of morbidity. The proportion of life spent in ill health decreases somewhat with increasing SDI, a relative compression of morbidity, which supports continued efforts to elevate personal income, improve education, and limit fertility. Our analysis of DALYs and HALE and their relationship to SDI represents a robust framework on which to benchmark geography-specific health performance and SDG progress. Country-specific drivers of disease burden, particularly for causes with higher-than-expected DALYs, should inform financial and research investments, prevention efforts, health policies, and health system improvement initiatives for all countries along the development continuum.

Comparable information on nonfatal health outcomes among these children and the fatal and nonfatal burden of diseases and injuries among older children and adolescents is scarce. OBJECTIVE To determine levels and trends in the fatal and nonfatal burden of diseases and injuries among younger children (aged < 5 years), older children (aged 5-9 years), and adolescents (aged 10-19 years) between 1990 and 2013 in 188 countries from the Global Burden of Disease (GBD) 2013 study. EVIDENCE REVIEW Data from vital registration, verbal autopsy studies, maternal and child death surveillance, and other sources covering 14 244 site-years (ie, years of cause of death data by geography) from 1980 through 2013 were used to estimate cause-specific mortality. Data from 35 620 epidemiological sources were used to estimate the prevalence of the diseases and sequelae in the GBD 2013 study. Cause-specific mortality for most causes was estimated using the Cause of Death Ensemble Model strategy. For some infectious diseases (eg, HIV infection/AIDS, measles, hepatitis B) where the disease process is complex or the cause of death data were insufficient or unavailable, we used natural history models. For most nonfatal health outcomes, DisMod-MR 2.0, a Bayesian metaregression tool, was used to meta-analyze the epidemiological data to generate prevalence estimates. FINDINGS Of the 7.7 (95% uncertainty interval [UI], 7.4-8.1) million deaths among children and adolescents globally in 2013, 6.28 million occurred among younger children, 0.48 million among older children, and 0.97 million among adolescents. In 2013, the leading causes of death were lower respiratory tract infections among younger children (905 059 deaths; 95% UI, 810304-998 125), diarrheal diseases among older children (38 325 deaths; 95% UI, 30 365-47 678), and road injuries among adolescents (115 186 deaths; 95% UI, 105 185-124 870). Iron deficiency anemia was the leading cause of years lived with disability among children and adolescents, affecting 619 (95% UI, 618-621) million in 2013. Large between-country variations exist in mortality from leading causes among children and adolescents. Countries with rapid declines in all-cause mortality between 1990 and 2013 also experienced large declines in most leading causes of death, whereas countries with the slowest declines had stagnant or increasing trends in the leading causes of death. In 2013, Nigeria had a 12% global share of deaths from lower respiratory tract infections and a 38% global share of deaths from malaria. India had 33% of the world's deaths from neonatal encephalopathy. Half of the world's diarrheal deaths among children and adolescents occurred in just 5 countries: India, Democratic Republic of the Congo, Pakistan, Nigeria, and Ethiopia. CONCLUSIONS AND RELEVANCE Understanding the levels and trends of the leading causes of death and disability among children and adolescents is critical to guide investment and inform policies. Monitoring these trends over time is also key to understanding where interventions are having an impact. Proven interventions exist to prevent or treat the leading causes of unnecessary death and disability among children and adolescents. The findings presented here show that these are underused and give guidance to policy makers in countries where more attention is needed.",Review,"Kyu, H.H.; Pinho, C.; Wagner, J.A.; Brown, J.C.; Bertozzi-Villa, A.; Charlson, F.J.; Coffeng, L.E.; Dandona, L.; Erskine, H.E.; Ferrari, A.J.; Fitzmaurice, C.; Fleming, T.D.; Forouzanfar, M.H.; Graetz, N.; Guinovart, C.; Haagsma, J.; Higashi, H.; Kassebaum, N.J.; Larson, H.J.; Lim, S.S.; Mokdad, A.H.; Moradi-Lakeh, M.; Odell, S.V.; Roth, G.A.; Serina, P.T.; Stanaway, J.D.; Misganaw, A.; Whiteford, H.A.; Wolock, T.M.; Hanson, S.W.; Abd-Allah, F.; Abera, S.F.; Abu-Raddad, L.J.; AlBuhairan, F.S.; Amare, A.T.; Antonio, C.A.T.; Artaman, A.; Barker-Collo, S.L.; Barrero, L.H.; Benjet, C.; Bensenor, I.M.; Bhutta, Z.A.; Bikbov, B.; Brazinova, A.; Campos-Nonato, I.; Castaneda-Orjuela, C.A.; Catala-Lopez, F.; Chowdhury, R.; Cooper, C.; Crump, J.A.; Dandona, R.; Degenhardt, L.; Dellavalle, R.P.; Dharmaratne, S.D.; Faraon, E.J.A.; Feigin, V.L.; Furst, T.; Geleijnse, J.M.; Gessner, B.D.; Gibney, K.B.; Goto, A.; Gunnell, D.; Hankey, G.J.; Hay, R.J.; Hornberger, J.C.; Hosgood, H.D.; Hu, G.Q.; Jacobsen, K.H.; Jayaraman, S.P.; Jeemon, P.; Jonas, J.B.; Karch, A.; Kim, D.; Kim, S.; Kokubo, Y.; Defo, B.K.; Bicer, B.K.; Kumar, G.A.; Larsson, A.; Leasher, J.L.; Leung, R.; Li, Y.M.; Lipshultz, S.E.; Lopez, A.D.; Lotufo, P.A.; Lunevicius, R.; Lyons, R.A.; Majdan, M.; Malekzadeh, R.; Mashal, T.; Mason-Jones, A.J.; Melaku, Y.A.; Memish, Z.A.; Mendoza, W.; Miller, T.R.; Mock, C.N.; Murray, J.; Nolte, S.; Oh, I.H.; Olusanya, B.O.; Ortblad, K.F.; Park, E.K.; Caicedo, A.J.P.; Patten, S.B.; Patton, G.C.; Pereira, D.M.; Perico, N.; Piel, F.B.; Polinder, S.; Popova, S.; Pourmalek, F.; Quistberg, D.A.; Remuzzi, G.; Rodriguez, A.; Rojas-Rueda, D.; Rothenbacher, D.; Rothstein, D.H.; Sanabria, J.; Santos, I.S.; Schwebel, D.C.; Sepanlou, S.G.; Shaheen, A.; Shiri, R.; Shiue, I.; Skirbekk, V.; Sliwa, K.; Sreeramareddy, C.T.; Stein, D.J.; Steiner, T.J.; Stovner, L.J.; Sykes, B.L.; Tabb, K.M.; Terkawi, A.S.; Thomson, A.J.; Thorne-Lyman, A.L.; Towbin, J.A.; Ukwaja, K.N.; Vasankari, T.; Venketasubramanian, N.; Vlassov, V.V.; Vollset, S.E.; Weiderpass, E.; Weintraub, R.G.; Werdecker, A.; Wilkinson, J.D.; Woldeyohannes, S.M.; Wolfe, C.D.A.; Yano, Y.; Yip, P.; Yonemoto, N.; Yoon, S.J.; Younis, M.Z.; Yu, C.H.; Zaki, M.E.; Naghavi, M.; Murray, C.J.L.; Vos, T.",,SYSTEMATIC ANALYSIS;DISABILITY;HIV;MORTALITY;PREVALENCE;SUICIDE;DEATH;TIME,United States;Australia;Netherlands;India;United Kingdom;Iran;Egypt;Ethiopia;Qatar;Saudi Arabia;Philippines;New Zealand;Colombia;Mexico;Brazil;Pakistan;Canada;Russian Federation;Austria;Slovakia;Spain;Sri Lanka;France;Japan;China;Germany;South Korea;Turkey;Sweden;Afghanistan;Peru;Nigeria;Portugal;Italy;Palestine;Finland;South Africa;Malaysia;Norway;Singapore,2-s2.0-84962415067

Aims To examine the associations between childhood adversities as risk factors for the onset and persistence of suicidal behaviour across 21 countries worldwide. Method Respondents from nationally representative samples (n = 55 299) were interviewed regarding childhood adversities that occurred before the age of 18 years and lifetime suicidal behaviour. Results Childhood adversities were associated with an increased risk of suicide attempt and ideation in both bivariate and multivariate models (odds ratio range 1.2-5.7). The risk increased with the number of adversities experienced, but at a decreasing rate. Sexual and physical abuse were consistently the strongest risk factors for both the onset and persistence of suicidal behaviour, especially during adolescence. Associations remained similar after additional adjustment for respondents' lifetime mental disorder status. Conclusions Childhood adversities (especially intrusive or aggressive adversities) are powerful predictors of the onset and persistence of suicidal behaviours.",Article,"Bruffaerts, R.; Demyttenaere, K.; Borges, G.; Haro, J.M.; Chiu, W.T.; Hwang, I.; Karam, E.G.; Kessler, R.C.; Sampson, N.; Alonso, J.; Andrade, L.H.; Angermeyer, M.; Benjet, C.; Bromet, E.; de Girolamo, G.; de Graaf, R.; Florescu, S.; Gureje, O.; Horiguchi, I.; Hu, C.Y.; Kovess, V.; Levinson, D.; Posada-Villa, J.; Sagar, R.; Scott, K.; Tsang, A.; Vassilev, S.M.; Williams, D.R.; Nock, M.K.",,NATIONAL COMORBIDITY SURVEY;SEXUAL-ABUSE;SURVIVAL ANALYSIS;PHYSICAL ABUSE;PREVALENCE;IDEATION;EXPERIENCES;PSYCHOPATHOLOGY;DEPRESSION;COMMUNITY,Belgium;Mexico;Spain;United States;Lebanon;Brazil;Austria;Italy;Netherlands;Romania;Nigeria;Japan;China;France;Israel;Colombia;India;New Zealand;Bulgaria,2-s2.0-77954617987
,,,115,WOS:000323600000036,2013,Patterns of multisite pain and associations with risk factors,"To explore definitions for multisite pain, and compare associations with risk factors for different patterns of musculoskeletal pain, we analysed cross-sectional data from the Cultural and Psychosocial Influences on Disability (CUPID) study. The study sample comprised 12,410 adults aged 20-59 years from 47 occupational groups in 18 countries. A standardised questionnaire was used to collect information about pain in the past month at each of 10 anatomical sites, and about potential risk factors. Associations with pain outcomes were assessed by Poisson regression, and characterised by prevalence rate ratios (PRRs). Extensive pain, affecting 6-10 anatomical sites, was reported much more frequently than would be expected if the occurrence of pain at each site were independent (674 participants vs 41.9 expected). In comparison with pain involving only 1-3 sites, it showed much stronger associations (relative to no pain) with risk factors such as female sex (PRR 1.6 vs 1.1), older age (PRR 2.6 vs 1.1), somatising tendency (PRR 4.6 vs 1.3), and exposure to multiple physically stressing occupational activities (PRR 5.0 vs 1.4). After adjustment for number of sites with pain, these risk factors showed no additional association with a distribution of pain that was widespread according to the frequently used American College of Rheumatology criteria. Our analysis supports the classification of pain at multiple anatomical sites simply by the number of sites affected, and suggests that extensive pain differs importantly in its associations with risk factors from pain that is limited to only a small number of anatomical sites.

The Latin American Consortium of Studies in Obesity (LASO),"Background: Limited knowledge on the prevalence and distribution of risk factors impairs the planning and implementation of cardiovascular prevention programs in the Latin American and Caribbean (LAC) region. Methods and Findings: Prevalence of hypertension, diabetes mellitus, abnormal lipoprotein levels, obesity, and smoking were estimated from individual-level patient data pooled from population-based surveys (1998-2007, n = 31,009) from eight LAC countries and from a national survey of the United States (US) population (1999-2004) Age and gender specific prevalence were estimated and age-gender adjusted comparisons between both populations were conducted. Prevalence of diabetes mellitus, hypertension, and low high-density lipoprotein (HDL)-cholesterol in LAC were 5% (95% confidence interval [95% CI]: 3.4, 7.9), 20.2% (95% CI: 12.5, 31), and 53.3% (95% CI: 47, 63.4), respectively. Compared to LAC region's average, the prevalence of each risk factor tended to be lower in Peru and higher in Chile. LAC women had higher prevalence of obesity and low HDL-cholesterol than men. Obesity, hypercholesterolemia, and hypertriglyceridemia were more prevalent in the US population than in LAC population (31 vs. 16.1%, 16.8 vs. 8.9%, and 36.2 vs. 26.5%, respectively). However, the prevalence of low HDL-cholesterol was higher in LAC than in the US (53.3 vs. 33.7%). Conclusions: Major cardiovascular risk factors are highly prevalent in LAC region, in particular low HDL-cholesterol. In addition, marked differences do exist in this prevalence profile between LAC and the US.

We aimed to quantify the clinical effect of carbapenem resistance on mortality and length of hospital stay among inpatients in LMICs with a bloodstream infection due to Enterobacteriaceae. Methods The PANORAMA study was a multinational prospective cohort study at tertiary hospitals in Bangladesh, Colombia, Egypt, Ghana, India, Lebanon, Nepal, Nigeria, Pakistan, and Vietnam, recruiting consecutively diagnosed patients with carbapenem-susceptible Enterobacteriaceae (CSE) and carbapenem-resistant Entero-bacteriaceae (CRE) bloodstream infections. We excluded patients who had previously been enrolled in the study and those not treated with curative intent at the time of bloodstream infection onset. There were no age restrictions. Central laboratories in India and the UK did confirmatory testing and molecular characterisation, including strain typing. We applied proportional subdistribution hazard models with inverse probability weighting to estimate the effect of carbapenem resistance on probability of discharge alive and in-hospital death, and multistate modelling for excess length of stay in hospital. All patients were included in the analysis. Findings Between Aug 1, 2014, and June 30, 2015, we recruited 297 patients from 16 sites in ten countries: 174 with CSE bloodstream infection and 123 with CRE bloodstream infection. Median age was 46 years (IQR 15-61). Crude mortality was 20% (35 of 174 patients) for patients with CSE bloodstream infection and 35% (43 of 123 patients) for patients with CRE bloodstream infection. Carbapenem resistance was associated with an increased length of hospital stay (3.7 days, 95% CI 0.3-6.9), increased probability of in-hospital mortality (adjusted subdistribution hazard ratio 1.75, 95% CI 1.04-2.94), and decreased probability of discharge alive (0.61, 0.454.83). Multilocus sequence typing showed various clades, with marginal overlap between strains in the CRE and CSE clades. Interpretation Carbapenem resistance is associated with increased length of hospital stay and mortality in patients with bloodstream infections in LMICs. These data will inform global estimates of the burden of antimicrobial resistance and reinforce the need for better strategies to prevent, diagnose, and treat CRE infections in LMICs.

Since nothing is known about the contribution of BRCA1 and BRCA2 germline mutations to hereditary breast/ovarian cancer in the Hispanic population from Colombia, we conducted the first study of 53 breast/ovarian cancer families from this country. Comprehensive BRCA mutation screening was performed using a range of techniques, including DHPLC, SSCP, and PTT, followed by DNA sequencing analysis. Thirteen deleterious germline mutations (24.5%) were identified in 53 families, comprising eight in BRCA1 and five in BRCA2. The two recurrent BRCA1 mutations, 3450 delCAAG and A1708E, accounted for 100% of all BRCA1 mutations identified in this cohort and the recurrent 3034 delACAA BRCA2 mutation for 40% of all BRCA2 mutations. Haplotype analyses suggested that each of these mutations has arisen from a common ancestor. The prevalence of BRCA1 or BRCA2 mutations was 50% in multiple case breast cancer families, and was 33% for the breast-ovarian cancer families. Our findings show that BRCA mutations account for a substantial proportion of hereditary breast/ovarian cancer in Colombia.

Objectives: To investigate the prevalence of asthma, allergic rhinitis, and atopic dermatitis symptoms in 6 cities in Colombia; to measure patient expenses and school days and workdays lost; to describe disease severity; and to determine levels of total and specific IgE in asthmatic subjects. Methods: A multistage stratified random sample selection of schools with subjects aged 5 to 18 years in each city was used. Guardian subjects selected were contacted, and home visits were arranged. Subjects aged 1 to 4 years and older than 19 years were also selected randomly by systematic sampling based on the addresses of the subjects aged 5 to 18 years. Subjects with asthma symptoms were invited to provide a blood sample. Results: Information was obtained from 6,507 subjects. The prevalence of asthma, rhinitis, and atopic dermatitis symptoms in the past 12 months was 10.4% (95% confidence interval [CI], 9.7%-11.1%), 22.6% (95% CI, 21.6%-23.6%), and 3.9% (95% CI, 3.4%-4.4%), respectively.

The frequency of diabetes in Latin America is expected to increase by 38% over the next 10 years, compared with an estimated 14% increase in the total population. The total number of cases of diabetes is expected to more than double and to exceed the number of cases in the US, Canada, and Europe by 2025. Factors underlying this increase include aging and increased life expectancy of the population, increased urbanization, and lifestyle changes among Native American populations. In many places, only a minority of individuals currently receives treatment for diabetes. Furthermore, the diagnosis of type 2 diabetes often occurs late in the course of the disease, with the result that 10-40% of patients have chronic complications at the time of diagnosis. Hospital costs account for most direct expenditures associated with treatment, and mortality associated with diabetes has increased markedly in some areas over the past 2 decades.

Longitudinal analyses using data from the Hispanic Established Populations for the Epidemiologic Study of the Elderly (1995-96/2004-05). Five southwestern states: Texas, New Mexico, Colorado, Arizona, and California. Mexican Americans aged 67 and older with complete information on the frailty index and the Mini Mental State Examination (MMSE) (n=1,815). Cognitive impairment determined by a score in the MMSE < 21. Frailty defined as three or more of the following components: 1) weight-loss, 2) weakness, 3) self-reported exhaustion, 4) slow walking speed, and 5) low physical activity level. Sociodemographic characteristics and chronic medical conditions were used as covariates. Mortality was determined using the National Death Index or by proxy. As MMSE score declines over time, the percent of frail individuals increases in a linear fashion. Frailty and cognitive impairment are independent risk factors for mortality after controlling for all covariates (HR 2.03 95% CI 1.57-2.62; HR 1.26 95% CI 1.05-1.52, respectively). When both cognitive impairment and frailty were added to the model, HR for individuals with cognitive impairment was no longer statistically significant.

Here, we describe clinical features of sleep disorders in AD and the relation between sleep disorders and both cognitive impairment and poor prognosis of the disease. There are difficulties of the diagnosis of sleep disorders based on sleep questionnaires, polysomnography or actigraphy in the AD patients. Typical disturbances of the neurophysiological sleep architecture in the course of the AD include deep sleep and paradoxical sleep deprivation. Among sleep disorders occurring in patients with AD, the most frequent disorders are sleep breathing disorders and restless legs syndrome. Sleep disorders may influence circadian fluctuations of the concentrations of amyloid-beta in the interstitial brain fluid and in the cerebrovascular fluid related to the glymphatic brain system and production of the amyloid-beta. There is accumulating evidence suggesting that disordered sleep contributes to cognitive decline and the development of AD pathology.

The average prevalence of diabetes in the Region is 8.0% and is expected to reach 9.8% by the year 2035. Prevalence is much lower in rural settings than in urban and the differences attributed to lifestyle changes may be a target for intervention. The indigenous population is a particularly vulnerable group needing special attention. On average, 24% of the adult cases with diabetes are undiagnosed but in some countries this is still as high as 50%. Health expenditure due to diabetes in the Region is around 9% of the global total. Inadequate glycemic control, defined as HbA1c >7%, is a strong predictor of chronic complications which increase resource use in the Region and less than half of the patients enrolled in diabetes care programmes are at target. Fifty percent or more of the adult population is overweight/obese and around one third of the adult population has metabolic syndrome using regional cutoffs for waist circumference. The number of people with IGT is almost equal to those with diabetes presenting an additional challenge for prevention. Children with type 1 diabetes represent only 0.2% of the total population with diabetes but the incidence may be increasing. In many places they have limited access to insulin, and even when available, it is not used appropriately. The available epidemiological data provide the background to act in developing national diabetes programmes which integrate diabetes care with cardiovascular prevention and promote diabetes prevention as well.

Numerous epidemiological factors affect the probability of developing breast or ovarian cancer, but no predictor is as determinant as inheriting a mutation in BRCA1 or BRCA2. The concept of the founder effect explains the reduced genetic variability in some populations, according to the theory that new populations can beformed from a reduced number of individuals, so the new population would carry only a small fraction of the genetic variability of the original population. The main purpose of this review is to provide an update on the state of the art in founder mutations and some recurrent mutations that have recently been described in Latin America. Methods. A literature search was performed in the electronic databases of PUBMED, EMBASE, LILACS, and BIREME using the terms BRCA1, BRCA2, founder mutation, Latin American population, and Hispanic. Sixty-two papers were identified, of which 38 were considered relevant for this review. Each result is shown per country. Results. In Latin America, clear founder effects have been reported in Mexico (BRCA1 del exons 9-12), Brazil (BRCA1 5382insC and BRCA2 c.156_157insAlu), and Colombia (BRCA1 3450del4, A1708E, and BRCA2 3034del4) and in Latinas residing in Southern California (BRCA1 185delAG, IVS5+1G>A, S955x, and R1443x). Of these, mutation BRCA1 3450del4 has also been reported in Brazil and Chile, whereas mutation BRCA2 3034del4 has been reported in Argentina and Peru. These data support the idea that although most Hispanic populations are the result of a mixture between Europeans, Africans, and Amerindians, the relative proportion of each genetic component varies throughout the Hispanic populations, making it necessary to identify the mutations characteristic of each population to generate mutation profiles adjusted to each one of them. Conclusion. In Latin American countries, and even among regions of the same country, there is great heterogeneity of ancestors. Therefore, Latinas should not be analyzed like other population groups without taking into account their genetic ancestry. The presence of founder mutations in specific population groups represents a cost-effective analysis. The importance of determining the founder mutations lies mainly in the decrease in costs. If we manage to decrease costs, screenings could be offered more widely and cover a larger number of women.",Review,"Ossa, C.A.; Torres, D.",Breast cancer; BRCA1; BRCA2; Latin America; Hereditary cancer; Hispanics,Breast cancer;BRCA1;BRCA2;Latin America;Hereditary cancer;Hispanics;BREAST-CANCER PATIENTS;OVARIAN-CANCER;BREAST/OVARIAN CANCER;HIGH-RISK;GERMLINE MUTATIONS;FAMILY-HISTORY;PREVALENCE;POPULATION;FREQUENCY;COLOMBIA,Colombia,2-s2.0-84978488585

This paper describes the methods of data collection and various characteristics of the study sample. Methods/Principal Findings: A standardised questionnaire covering musculoskeletal symptoms, disability and potential risk factors, was used to collect information from 47 samples of nurses, office workers, and other (mostly manual) workers in 18 countries from six continents. In addition, local investigators provided data on economic aspects of employment for each occupational group. Participation exceeded 80% in 33 of the 47 occupational groups, and after pre-specified exclusions, analysis was based on 12,426 subjects (92 to 1018 per occupational group). As expected, there was high usage of computer keyboards by office workers, while nurses had the highest prevalence of heavy manual lifting in all but one country. There was substantial heterogeneity between occupational groups in economic and psychosocial aspects of work; three-to fivefold variation in awareness of someone outside work with musculoskeletal pain; and more than ten-fold variation in the prevalence of adverse health beliefs about back and arm pain, and in awareness of terms such as ""repetitive strain injury"" (RSI).

The objective of this study was to describe the prevalence of dyslipidemia in the CARMELA study population. Methods. CARMELA was a cross-sectional study of cardiovascular risk conducted between September 2003 and August 2005 in adults (aged 25 to 64 years) living in Barquisimeto (n = 1,824), Bogot (n = 1,511), Buenos Aires (n = 1,412), Lima (n = 1,628), Mexico City (n = 1,677), Quito (n = 1,620), and Santiago (n = 1,605). Dyslipidemia was defined as the presence of one or more of the following conditions: triglycerides >= 200 mg/dL, or total cholesterol (TC) >= 240 mg/dL, or HDL cholesterol < 40 mg/dL, or LDL cholesterol = not optimal, or currently taking antilipemic agents. Results. Prevalence rates of dyslipidemia in men and women were: 75.5% (CI: 71.9-79.1) and 48.7% (CI: 45.4-51.9) in Barquisimeto: 70% (CI: 66.2-73.8) and 47.7% (CI: 43.9-51.5) in Bogota; 50.4% (CI: 46.8-54.0) and 24.1% (CI: 21.0-27.2) in Buenos Aires: 73.1% (CI: 69.3-76.8) and 62.8% (CI: 59.2-66.5) in Lima; 62.5% (CI: 58.5-66.5) and 37.5% (CI: 33.5-41.6) in Mexico City; 52.2% (CI: 47.9-56.5) and 38.1% (CI: 34.5-41.7) in Quito: and, 50.8% (CI: 47.1-54.4) and 32.8% (CI: 29.3-36.3) in Santiago. Conclusions. Dyslipidemia was disturbingly prevalent and varied across cities. The most frequent dyslipidemia was low HDL-C followed by high triglycerides. The high TC/HDL-C ratios and non-HDL-C levels suggest a high risk of cardiovascular disease. (C) 2009 Elsevier Inc.

Susceptibility found for ampicillin, amoxicillin/clavulanic acid, and chloramphenicol was 100%, whereas it was 98% for other antimicrobials such as trimethoprim/sulfamethoxazole, 97% for azithromycin, 92% for vancomycin, 90% for erythromycin, 86% for tetracycline, 84% for penicillin, 70% for ciprofloxacin, 57% for rifampin, 56% for meropenem, and 32% for clindamycin. Natural resistance to cephalosporins was confirmed in all cases, and 16% of isolates were nonsusceptible to penicillin. Using Staphylococcus spp. or Enterococcus spp. breakpoints, 48% of isolates displayed multidrug resistances, and the major resistance phenotypes were against rifampin, clindamycin, ciprofloxacin, azithromycin, and erythromycin.

,,,40,WOS:000493023300007,2019,Gait speed as a mediator of the effect of sarcopenia on dependency in activities of daily living,"Background Sarcopenia in older adults is strongly associated with an increase in dependency in activities of daily living (ADL) and with a decline in gait speed. Interestingly, gait speed has been shown to independently predict mortality. In this context, our study aimed to explore the mediator role of gait speed on the relationship between sarcopenia and dependency in ADL. Methods A cross-sectional study was conducted in Colombia, 19 705 older adults with a mean age of 70 years, 55.6% women, 16.1% with sarcopenia, and 14.7% mild, moderate, or severe dependency in ADL, according to 'SABE Survey 2015'. Sarcopenia was assessed by calf circumference and ADL dependence through the Barthel Index. Gait speed was measured over a distance of 3 m. The association between sarcopenia condition and gait speed and dependency level was analysed by linear regression adjusted by covariates. To examine whether gait speed mediated the association between sarcopenia and dependence components of physical function, simple mediation models were generated using ordinary least squares with the macro PROCESS version 3.2, adjusted for age, sex, and body mass index (BMI). Results Significant differences (P < 0.05) were found in gait speed and dependency in ADL between the sarcopenia and non-sarcopenia groups after adjusting for age, sex, and BMI. BMI was significantly higher in the non-sarcopenia group whereas dependency was significantly higher in the sarcopenia group (19.6% vs. 13.8%). Results from mediation model regression analysis indicated a significant and direct detrimental effect of sarcopenia on dependency in ADL (beta = -0.05; P < 0.001), and a significant indirect effect of gait speed on the direct effect (-0.009 to -0.004). Conclusions The negative effect of sarcopenia on functional dependence was mediated by the gait speed. Therefore, gait speed may positively influence the detrimental effect of sarcopenia for dependency, after adjusting for age, gender, and BMI. Consequently, physical exercise should be promoted and focused to circumvent the gait speed decline associated with age in older people with sarcopenia.",Article,"Perez-Sousa, M.A.; Venegas-Sanabria, L.C.; Chavarro-Carvajal, D.A.; Cano-Gutierrez, C.A.; Izquierdo, M.; Correa-Bautista, J.E.; Ramirez-Velez, R.",Gait speed; Sarcopenia; Elderly; Functional Capacity; Latin-American,Gait speed;Sarcopenia;Elderly;Functional Capacity;Latin-American;WALKING SPEED;OLDER-ADULTS;MUSCLE MASS;INCIDENT DISABILITY;CALF CIRCUMFERENCE;EXERCISE;FRAILTY;INDEPENDENCE;PERFORMANCE;PREVALENCE,Spain;Colombia,2-s2.0-85065526177

Baseline data on musculoskeletal pain, disability, and potential correlates were collected by questionnaire from 12,195 workers in 47 occupational groups (mostly office workers, nurses, and manual workers) in 18 countries (response rate 5 70%). Continuing pain after a mean interval of 14 months was ascertained through a follow-up questionnaire in 9150 workers from 45 occupational groups. Associations with personal and occupational factors were assessed by Poisson regression and summarised by prevalence rate ratios (PRRs). The 1-month prevalence of GPNS at baseline was much greater than that of LNSP (35.1% vs 5.6%), and it tended to be more troublesome and disabling. Unlike LNSP, the prevalence of GPNS increased with age. Moreover, it showed significantly stronger associations with somatising tendency (PRR 1.6 vs 1.3) and poor mental health (PRR 1.3 vs 1.1); greater variation between the occupational groups studied (prevalence ranging from 0% to 67.6%) that correlated poorly with the variation in LNSP; and was more persistent at follow-up (72.1% vs 61.7%).

Aims To estimate the prevalence of frailty and sarcopenia among older adults in Colombia and identify variables associated with these conditions. Methods Data come from the ""Salud Bienestar y Enve-jecimiento'' (SABE) Bogota 'Study, a cross-sectional study conducted in 2012 in Bogota', Colombia. Sociodemographic, health, cognitive and anthropometric measures were collected from 2000 community-dwelling adults aged 60 years and older. Frailty variable was created using the Fried phenotype and sarcopenia following the European Working Group on Sarcopenia in Older People algorithm. Logistic regression analyses were used to identify factors associated with frailty and sarcopenia. Results A total of 135 older adults are frail (9.4 %), while 166 have sarcopenia (11.5 %). Older age and female gender have a significant association with both conditions (Frailty: Age OR 1.05, 95 % CI 1.03-1.06, Gender OR 1.44, 95 % CI 1.12-1.84; Sarcopenia: Age 1.04, 95 % CI 1.02-1.07, Gender OR 1.51, 95 % CI 1.05-2.17). Depression was also significantly associated with frailty (OR 1.17, 95 % CI 1.12-1.22), while smoking was significantly associated with sarcopenia (OR 2.38, 95 % CI 1.29-4.37). Finally, higher function, measured by independence in IADL (Instrumental Activities of Daily Living) was significantly associated with less frailty (OR 0.74, 95 % CI 0.64-0.86). Education, higher number of comorbidities, better MMSE score, activities of daily living disability and alcohol consumption were not significantly associated with frailty or sarcopenia. Conclusions Frailty, sarcopenia and multimorbidity are overlapping, yet distinct conditions in this sample.

Twenty-four population- and hospital-based birth defects surveillance registers from 18 countries, contributed data on T13 and T18 between 1974 and 2014 using a common data-reporting protocol. The mean total birth prevalence (i.e., LB, stillbirths, and elective termination of pregnancy for fetal anomalies [ETOPFA]) in the registers with ETOPFA (n = 15) for T13 was 1.68 (95% CI 1.3-2.06), and for T18 was 4.08 (95% CI 3.01-5.15), per 10,000 births. The prevalence varied among the various registers. The mean prevalence among LB in all registers for T13 was 0.55 (95%CI 0.38-0.72), and for T18 was 1.07 (95% CI 0.77-1.38), per 10,000 births. The median mortality in the first week of life was 48% for T13 and 42% for T18, across all registers, half of which occurred on the first day of life. Across 16 registers with complete 1-year follow-up, mortality in first year of life was 87% for T13 and 88% for T18. This study provides an international perspective on prevalence and mortality of T13 and T18.

Randomized, placebo-controlled, double-blind trials assessing the efficacy of flunarizine for preventing migraine were included. We evaluated the frequency of the attacks by comparing the mean frequency before and after the intervention for each group of treatment and then the two groups were compared. To evaluate the security of flunarizine we used included and excluded studies and open trials. Results. Nine studies were obtained but only four met the inclusion criteria. The fixed effects model reported a reduction in the frequency of attacks by using flunarizine. The monthly difference was 0.55 attacks (CI 95%= 0.215-0.895; p= 0.002). Somnolence was the most frequent adverse effect in 20.5% of the subjects (n= 1,987). Conclusions. Based on a small number of trials, flunarizine, at a daily dose of 10 mg lightly reduces the frequency of migraine attacks.",Article,"Reveiz-Herault, L.; Cardona, A.F.; Ospina, E.G.; Carrillo, P.",chemoprevention; flunarizine; meta-analysis; migraine; placebo; systematic review,chemoprevention;flunarizine;meta-analysis;migraine;placebo;systematic review;TENSION-TYPE HEADACHE;DOUBLE-BLIND;UNITED-STATES;CLINICAL-TRIALS;POPULATION;PREVALENCE;QUALITY;EPIDEMIOLOGY;GUIDELINES,Colombia,2-s2.0-0038311833

In developing countries, there is a dearth of information regarding the public health magnitude of stroke. The aim of the Fogarty-Mexico cohort was to assess the prevalence of vascular behavioral and cognitive disorders, ranging from mild vascular cognitive impairment (VCI) to vascular dementia (VaD), in a cohort of acute first-ever symptomatic stroke patients in Mexico. Methods: A total of 165 consecutive, first-ever stroke patients admitted to the National Institute of Neurology and Neurosurgery in Mexico City, were included in the cohort. Patients were eligible if they had an ischemic stroke, primary intracerebral hemorrhage, or cerebral venous thrombosis (CVT). Stroke diagnosis required the presence of an acute focal deficit lasting more than 24 h, confirmed by a corresponding lesion on CT/MRI. Stroke severity was established with the NIH Stroke Scale. The pre-stroke functional status was determined by the IQCODE. Three months after the occurrence of stroke, 110 survivor patients returned for follow-up and were able to undergo functional outcome (modified Rankin scale, Barthel index), along with neurological, psychiatric, neuropsychological, laboratory, and imaging assessments. We compared depression, demographic, and clinical and imaging features between patients with and without dementia, and between patients with VCI and those with intact cognition. Results: Of the 110 patients (62% men, mean age 56 +/- 17.8, education 7.7 +/- 5.2 years) 93 (84%) had ischemic strokes, 14 (13%) intracerebral hemorrhage, and 3 (3%) CVT. The main risk factors were hypertension (50%), smoking (40%), hypercholesterolemia (29%), hyperhomocysteinemia (24%), and diabetes (22%). Clinical and neuropsychological evaluations demonstrated post-stroke depression in 56%, VCI in 41%, and VaD in 12%; 17% of the latter had pre-stroke functional impairment (IQCODE > 3.5). Cognitive deficits included executive function in 69%, verbal memory in 49%, language in 38%, perception in 36%, and attention in 38%. Executive dysfunction occurred in 36% of non-demented subjects, 65% of them with mild-moderate deficits in daily living activities. Female gender (p <= 0.054), older age (mean age 65.6 years vs. 49.3, p < 0.001), diabetes (p <= 0.004), illiteracy and lower education (p <= 0.001), and PSD (p = 0.03) were significantly higher in VCI-VaD compared with cognitively intact post-stroke subjects. We could not demonstrate an association with lesion site and distribution of the cognitive deficits. Conclusions: The Fogarty-Mexico cohort recruited relatively young acute stroke patients, compared with other Mexican stroke cohorts. PSD and VCI occurred frequently but prevalence of VaD (12%) was lower than expected. A high prevalence of treatable stroke risk factors suggests that preventive interventions are advisable.

Allele-specific polymerase chain reaction (ASP-PCR) was used to identify H. pylori 23S rRNA and gyrA mutation using gastric biopsies from Colombian patients and confirmed by PCR and sequencing of the 23S rRNA and gyrA genes. The sensitivity and specificity of ASP-PCR were compared with susceptibilities measured by agar dilution. Samples included gastric biopsies from 107 biopsies with H. pylori infections and 20 H. pylori negative. The sensitivity and specificity of ASP-PCR for the 23S rRNA gene were both 100%. The sensitivity and specificity of ASP-PCR for the gyrA gene, published in 2007 by Nishizawa et al., were 52% and 92.7%, respectively; the lower sensitivity was due to the presence of mutation N87I in our samples, which were not detected by the test. In this study, we designed new primers to detect the mutation N87I in GyrA. The ASP-PCR was performed with the original primers plus the new primers. The molecular test with the new primers improved the sensitivity to 100%. In conclusion, ASP-PCR provides a specific and rapid means of predicting resistance to clarithromycin and levofloxacin in gastric biopsies. (C) 2015 Elsevier Inc.

The data were obtained from the 2015 Colombian Health and Wellbeing and Aging Survey. A total of 3307 elderly Colombian individuals (aged over 60 years) were included. Anthropometric data, fasting plasma glucose, blood lipid profiles, family history, and health-related behaviors were assessed, and prediabetes was defined as a fasting plasma glucose of 100 to 125 mg/dL. The areas under the receiver operating characteristic (ROC) curves (AUCs) were calculated for each anthropometric indicator, using the prediabetes classification to identify their sensitivity and specificity, and these indicated that the prevalence of prediabetes was 25.3% in this population. After adjusting for potential confounding factors, the TyG index was strongly associated with the odds of having prediabetes in both sexes, and multivariate logistic regression analysis showed that the ORs for prediabetes increased across quartiles (p < 0.001). The TyG index was best able to identify prediabetes in either sex (AUC and optimal cut-off = 0.700 and 8.72, and 0.695 and 8.92 for men and women, respectively), suggesting that compared to the other parameters, the TyG index has the best discriminative power to predict prediabetes in the whole population.

Study design: Data were used from the Study on global AGEing and adult health (SAGE) wave 1 (2007-2010). Nationally representative samples of adults aged 50 + years from China, Ghana, India, Mexico, the Russian Federation and South Africa were analyzed (n = 31,174). Main outcome measures: Educational level and wealth were used as socioeconomic indicators. Frailty was assessed with modified criteria for the frailty phenotype. Self-reported disease diagnoses were used. A relative index of inequality (RID was calculated to compare socioeconomic inequalities in frailty between countries. Results: People in lower socioeconomic positions had higher prevalence rates of frailty. The largest inequalities in frailty were found in Mexico (RII 3.7, 95% CI 2.1-6.4), and the smallest inequalities in Ghana (RII 1.1, 95% CI 0.7-1.8). Mediation analyses revealed that the chronic diseases considered in this study do not explain the higher prevalence of frailty seen in lower socioeconomic groups. Conclusions: Substantial socioeconomic inequalities in frailty were observed in LMICs, but additional research is needed to find explanations for these.

Management strategies that reduce losses in the clinical pathway from infection to cure might improve STI control and reduce complications resulting from lack of, or inadequate, treatment. Objectives To assess the effectiveness and safety of home-based specimen collection as part of the management strategy for Chlamydia trachomatis and Neisseria gonorrhoeae infections compared with clinic-based specimen collection in sexually-active people. Search methods We searched the Cochrane Sexually Transmitted Infections Group Specialized Register, the Cochrane Central Register of Controlled Trials (CENTRAL), MEDLINE, EMBASE and LILACS on 27 May 2015, together with the World Health Organization International Clinical Trials Registry (ICTRP) and ClinicalTrials.gov. We also handsearched conference proceedings, contacted trial authors and reviewed the reference lists of retrieved studies. Selection criteria Randomized controlled trials (RCTs) of home-based compared with clinic-based specimen collection in the management of C. trachomatis and N. gonorrhoeae infections. Data collection and analysis Three review authors independently assessed trials for inclusion, extracted data and assessed risk of bias. We contacted study authors for additional information. We resolved any disagreements through consensus. We used standard methodological procedures recommended by Cochrane. The primary outcome was index case management, defined as the number of participants tested, diagnosed and treated, if test positive. Main results Ten trials involving 10,479 participants were included. There was inconclusive evidence of an effect on the proportion of participants with index case management (defined as individuals tested, diagnosed and treated for CT or NG, or both) in the group with home-based (45/778, 5.8%) compared with clinic-based (51/788, 6.5%) specimen collection (risk ratio (RR) 0.88, 95% confidence interval (CI) 0.60 to 1.29; 3 trials, I-2 = 0%, 1566 participants, moderate quality). Harms of home-based specimen collection were not evaluated in any trial. All 10 trials compared the proportions of individuals tested. The results for the proportion of participants completing testing had high heterogeneity (I-2 = 100%) and were not pooled. We could not combine data from individual studies looking at the number of participants tested because the proportions varied widely across the studies, ranging from 30% to 96% in home group and 6% to 97% in clinic group (low-quality evidence). The number of participants with positive test was lower in the home-based specimen collection group (240/2074, 11.6%) compared with the clinic-based group (179/967, 18.5%) (RR 0.72, 95% CI 0.61 to 0.86; 9 trials, I-2 = 0%, 3041 participants, moderate quality). Authors' conclusions Home-based specimen collection could result in similar levels of index case management for CT or NG infection when compared with clinic-based specimen collection. Increases in the proportion of individuals tested as a result of home-based, compared with clinic-based, specimen collection are offset by a lower proportion of positive results. The harms of home-based specimen collection compared with clinic-based specimen collection have not been evaluated. Future RCTs to assess the effectiveness of home-based specimen collection should be designed to measure biological outcomes of STI case management, such as proportion of participants with negative tests for the relevant STI at follow-up.",Review,"Fajardo-Bernal, L.; Aponte-Gonzalez, J.; Vigil, P.; Angel-Muller, E.; Rincon, C.; Gaitan, H.G.; Low, N.",,SEXUALLY-TRANSMITTED INFECTIONS;ACID AMPLIFICATION TESTS;VAGINAL SWABS;PARTNER NOTIFICATION;POPULATION;WOMEN;INTERNET;TRIAL;RATES;PREVALENCE,Colombia;United States;Switzerland,2-s2.0-84964693564

Mucopolysaccharidoses are a group of infrequent disorders caused by the lysosomal deposit of glycosaminoglycans. Its incidence is quite variable among the countries where it has been documented. In Brazil, disorder frequencies have been reported, but in Colombia information on them is scarce. Objectives. The frequency and spatial aggregations of the mucopolysaccharidoses were estimated by a retrospective study in two central Colombian provinces. Materials and methods. The records of patients and live newborns between 1998-2007 were reviewed from several reference institutions for genetic diseases. From these records, the frequencies for each mucopolysaccharidosis were estimated. The spatial aggregation of the cases was analyzed using the SaTScan software. Results. The combined frequency for all the mucopolysaccharidoses was 1.98 cases per 100,000 live newborns. MPS IV had the highest frequency with 0.68 cases per 100,000 live newborns and MPS III showed a lower frequency of 0.17/100,000. Three spatial aggregation areas were indicated for MPS I, MPS III and MPS IV. Conclusion. The combined frequency for all the mucopolysaccharidoses has been reported, with type IV the most frequent and the type VII in second place. The data herein constitute a record subset and, in spite of the difficulties inherent to the data retrieval in Colombia, they are a valid estimate of the frequencies of these diseases in central Colombia.",Article,"Gomez, A.M.; Garcia-Robles, R.; Suarez-Obando, F.",mucopolysaccharidoses/epidemiology; metabolism; inborn errors; lysosomal storage diseases; cluster analysis,mucopolysaccharidoses/epidemiology;metabolism;inborn errors;lysosomal storage diseases;cluster analysis;INBORN-ERRORS;DISEASES;PREVALENCE;RATES;GENE,Colombia,

This disease is generally undiagnosed and several deadly outbreaks have been reported in the country in the last decade. The aim of this study is to analyze the eco-epidemiological aspects of rickettsial seropositivity in rural areas of Colombia where outbreaks of the disease were previously reported. A cross-sectional study, which included 597 people living in 246 households from nine hamlets in two municipalities of Colombia, was conducted from November 2015 to January 2016. The survey was conducted to collect sociodemographic and household characteristics (exposure) data. Blood samples were collected to determine the rickettsial seropositivity in humans, horses and dogs (IFA, cut-off = 1/128). In addition, infections by rickettsiae were detected in ticks from humans and animals by real-time PCR targeting gltA and ompA genes. Data was analyzed by weighted multilevel cloglog regression model using three levels (person, household and hamlets) and rickettsial seropositivity in humans was the main outcome. Overall prevalence of rickettsial seropositivity in humans was 25.62% (95% CI 22.11-29.12). Age in years (PR = 1.01 95% CI 1.01-1.02) and male sex (PR = 1.65 95% CI 1.43-1.90) were risk markers for rickettsial seropositivity. Working outdoors (PR = 1.20 95% CI 1.02-1.41), deforestation and forest fragmentation for agriculture use (PR = 1.75 95% CI 1.51-2.02), opossum in peridomiciliary area (PR = 1.56 95% CI 1.37-1.79) and a high proportion of seropositive domestic animals in the home (PR20-40% vs (<20%) = 2.28 95% CI 1.59-3.23 and PR>40% vs (<20%) = 3.14 95% CI 2.43-4.04) were associated with rickettsial seropositivity in humans. This study showed the presence of Rickettsia antibodies in human populations and domestic animals.

Nevertheless, the characteristics and uses in South America are unknown. Objectives: To identify sources, characteristics, and uses of RWE in Argentina, Brazil, Colombia, and Chile, and evaluate the context-specific challenges. The implications for future regulation and responsible management of RWE in the region are also considered. Methods: A systematic literature review, database mapping, and targeted gray literature search were conducted to identify the sources and characteristics of RWE. Findings were validated by key opinion leaders attending workshops in 4 South American countries. Results: A database mapping exercise revealed 407 unique databases. Geographic scope, database type, population, and outcomes captured were reported. Characteristics of national health information systems show efforts to collect interoperable data from service providers, insurers, and government agencies, but that initiatives are hampered by fragmentation, lack of stewardship, and resources. In South America, RWE is mainly used for pharmacovigilance and as pure academic research, but less so for health technology assessment decision making or pricing negotiations and not at all to inform early access schemes.

The aims of the study were to determine the prevalence and changes in primary levofloxacin resistance related to H. pylori gyrA sequences. The study utilized H. pylori strains isolated from patients undergoing gastroscopy in Bogota, Colombia from 2009 to 2014. Levofloxacin susceptibility was assessed by agar dilution. Mutations in gyrA sequences affecting the quinolone resistance-determining region (QRDR) were evaluated by direct sequencing. Overall, the mean prevalence of primary levofloxacin resistance was 18.2% (80 of 439 samples). Resistance increased from 11.8%(12/102) in 2009 to 27.3% (21/77) in 2014 (p = 0.001). gyrA mutations in levofloxacin resistant strains were present in QRDR positions 87 and 91.

The effectiveness of oxygen therapy and of different delivery methods remains uncertain. Objectives To determine the effectiveness and safety of oxygen therapy and oxygen delivery methods in the treatment of LRTIs and to define the indications for oxygen therapy in children with LRTIs. Search methods For this update, we searched CENTRAL, MEDLINE, EMBASE and LILACS from March 2008 to October 2014. Selection criteria Randomised controlled trials (RCTs) or non-RCTs comparing oxygen versus no oxygen therapy or different methods of oxygen delivery in children with LRTI aged from three months to 15 years. To determine the indications for oxygen therapy, we included observational studies or diagnostic test accuracy studies. Data collection and analysis Three review authors independently scanned the search results to identify studies for inclusion. Two authors independently performed the methodological assessment and the third author resolved any disagreements. We calculated risk ratios (RRs) and their 95% confidence intervals (CIs) for dichotomous outcomes and adverse events (AEs). We performed fixed-effect meta-analyses for the estimation of pooled effects whenever there was no heterogeneity between included RCTs. We summarised the results reported in the included observational studies for the clinical indicators of hypoxaemia. Main results In this review update, we included four studies (479 participants) assessing the efficacy of non-invasive delivery methods for the treatment of LRTI in children and 14 observational studies assessing the clinical sign indicators of hypoxaemia in children with LRTIs. Three RCTs (399 participants) compared the effectiveness of nasal prongs or nasal cannula with nasopharyngeal catheter; one non-RCT (80 participants) compared head box, facemask, nasopharyngeal catheter and nasal cannula. The nasopharyngeal catheter was the control group. Treatment failure was defined as number of children failing to achieve adequate arterial oxygen saturation. All included studies had a high risk of bias because of allocation methods and lack of blinded outcome assessment. For nasal prongs versus nasopharyngeal catheter, the pooled effect estimate for RCTs showed a worrying trend towards no difference between the groups (two RCTs; 239 participants; RR 0.93, 95% CI 0.36 to 2.38). Similar results were shown in the one non-RCT (RR 1.0, 95% CI 0.44 to 2.27). The overall quality of this evidence is very low. Nasal obstruction due to severe mucus production was different between treatment groups (three RCTs, 338 participants; RR 0.20, 95% CI 0.09 to 0.44; I-2 statistic = 0%). The quality of this evidence is low. The use of a facemask showed a statistically significant lower risk of failure to achieve arterial oxygen > 60 mm Hg than the nasopharyngeal catheter (one non-RCT; 80 participants; odds ratio (OR) 0.20, 95% CI 0.05 to 0.88). The use of a head box showed a non-statistically significant trend towards a reduced risk of treatment failure compared to the nasopharyngeal catheter (one non-RCT; OR 0.40, 95% CI 0.13 to 1.12). The quality of this evidence is very low. To determine the presence of hypoxaemia in children presenting with LRTI, we assessed the sensitivity and specificity of nine clinical signs reported by the included observational studies and used this information to calculate likelihood ratios. The results showed that there is no single clinical sign or symptom that accurately identifies hypoxaemia. Authors' conclusions It appears that oxygen therapy given early in the course of pneumonia via nasal prongs at a flow rate of 1 to 2 L/min does not prevent children with severe pneumonia from developing hypoxaemia. However, the applicability of this evidence is limited as it comes from a small pilot trial. Nasal prongs and nasopharyngeal catheter are similar in effectiveness when used for children with LRTI. Nasal prongs are associated with fewer nasal obstruction problems. The use of a face mask and head box has been poorly studied and it is not superior to a nasopharyngeal catheter in terms of effectiveness or safety in children with LRTI. Studies assessing the effectiveness of oxygen therapy and oxygen delivery methods in children with different baseline risks are needed. There is no single clinical sign or symptom that accurately identifies hypoxaemia in children with LRTI.

This scenario places unprecedented clinical, social, and economic burden upon patients, families, and health systems. The challenges prove particularly pressing for conditions with highly specific diagnostic and management demands, such as frontotemporal dementia. Here we introduce a research and networking initiative designed to tackle these ensuing hurdles, the Multi-partner consortium to expand dementia research in Latin America (ReDLat). First, we present ReDLat's regional research framework, aimed at identifying the unique genetic, social, and economic factors driving the presentation of frontotemporal dementia and Alzheimer's disease in Latin America relative to the US. We describe ongoing ReDLat studies in various fields and ongoing research extensions. Then, we introduce actions coordinated by ReDLat and the Latin America and Caribbean Consortium on Dementia (LAC-CD) to develop culturally appropriate diagnostic tools, regional visibility and capacity building, diplomatic coordination in local priority areas, and a knowledge-to-action framework toward a regional action plan. Together, these research and networking initiatives will help to establish strong cross-national bonds, support the implementation of regional dementia plans, enhance health systems' infrastructure, and increase translational research collaborations across the continent.",Review,"Ibanez, A.; Yokoyama, J.S.; Possin, K.L.; Matallana, D.; Lopera, F.; Nitrini, R.; Takada, L.T.; Custodio, N.; Ortiz, A.L.S.; Avila-Funes, J.A.; Behrens, M.I.; Slachevsky, A.; Myers, R.M.; Cochran, J.N.; Brusco, L.I.; Bruno, M.A.; Brucki, S.M.D.; Pina-Escudero, S.D.; de Oliveira, M.O.; Kehoe, P.D.; Garcia, A.M.; Cardona, J.F.; Santamaria-Garcia, H.; Moguilner, S.; Duran-Aniotz, C.; Tagliazucchi, E.; Maito, M.; Ibarrola, E.M.L.; Pintado-Caipa, M.; Godoy, M.E.; Bakman, V.; Javandel, S.; Kosik, K.S.; Valcour, V.; Miller, B.L.",dementia; fronto-temporal dementia; SES; SDOH; genetics; Alzheimer&apos; s disease; implementation science; Latin America,dementia;fronto-temporal dementia;SES;SDOH;genetics;Alzheimer&apos;s disease;implementation science;Latin America;DOMINANT ALZHEIMER-DISEASE;ATTENTION-DEFICIT/HYPERACTIVITY DISORDER;SOCIAL COGNITION SKILLS;MEMORY BINDING DEFICITS;FRONTOTEMPORAL DEMENTIA;NEURAL MARKERS;CONNECTIVITY;VARIABILITY;PREVALENCE;BIOMARKERS,United States;Ireland;Argentina;Chile;Colombia;Brazil;Peru;Mexico;France,2-s2.0-85103097770;2-s2.0-85103097770

Method: From a cohort of 731 children in 8 institutions for the deaf, we identified 322 (44%) with presumed non-syndromic deafness. These were invited to a more detailed evaluation, but 46 chose not to participate. The remaining 276 individuals received a complete ophthalmological evaluation that was normal in 205 (74.3%) and showed salt and pepper retinopathy in 55 (19.9%) and other ocular abnormalities in 16 (5.8%). A comprehensive medical. history, and a detailed physical examination were performed in the 205 children with normal ocular exam. Of these, 93 were found to have acquired deafness and/or associated anomalies and 112 (115.3% of the initial 731 children), non-syndromic deafness. The GJB2 gene was sequenced in these 112 individuals. Results: Based on family history, 59.8% (67/112) of these cases had autosomal recessive non-syndromic sensorineural hearing loss and the remaining 40.2% (45/ 112) were sporadic, without apparent known cause. We identified three mutations in the GJB2 gene: 35delG, S199F, and 167delT, all of which have been previously reported in the literature, the variant M34T, and the polymorphism V271. S199F was the most frequent mutation (17.9%), followed by 35delG (17.0%) and 167delT (0.4%). The mutations in the GJB2 gene were present in 50.7% of the autosomal recessive group and in 33.3% of the sporadic cases. Conclusions: Our pilot study showed that 15.3% of institutionalized deaf children in Bogota have non-syndromic deafness and among them, the frequency of the S199F mutation was higher than reported in previous studies, whereas the frequency of the 35delG is similar to Caucasian populations. The fact that the S199F mutation was the most frequent allele in our study confirms the fact that the prevalence of GJB2 mutations depends on the ethnic origin. We emphasize the need to follow a strict protocol to identify bona fide cases of non-syndromic deafness among individuals with congenital hearing loss in order to identify the molecular basis of this condition.

The aim of this study was to use self-report data to characterise socio-demographic patterns of PA and ST in eight Latin American countries. Methods: Data were obtained from the Latin American Study of Nutrition and Health (ELANS), a household population-based, multi-national, cross-sectional survey (n = 9218, aged 15-65 years), collected from September 2014 to February 2015. Transport and leisure PA and ST were assessed using the International Physical Activity Questionnaire-long version. Overall and country-specific mean and median levels of time spent in transport and leisure PA and ST were compared by sex, age, socioeconomic and education level. Results: Mean levels of transport and leisure PA were 220.3 min/week (ranging from 177.6 min/week in Venezuela to 275.3 min/week in Costa Rica) and 316.4 min/week (ranging from 272.1 min/week in Peru to 401.4 min/week in Ecuador). Transport and leisure PA were higher (p < 0.005) in men than women with mean differences of 58.0 and 34.0 min/week. The mean and median for transport PA were similar across age groups (15-29 years: mean 215.5 and median 120 min/week; 30-59 years: mean 225.0 and median 120 min/week; >= 60 years: mean 212.0 and median 120 min/week). The median time spent in transport and leisure PA between three strata of socioeconomic and education levels were similar. The prevalence of not meeting PA recommendations were 69.9% (95% CI: 68.9-70.8) for transport and 72.8% (95% CI: 72.0-73.7) for leisure. Men, younger people (15-29 years), individuals with higher socioeconomic and education levels spent significantly (p < 0.001) more time sitting than women, older people (30-59 years and >= 60 years) and those in the middle and low socioeconomic and education groups, respectively. Conclusions: Transport and leisure PA and ST range widely by country, sex, and age group in Latin America.

Bacillus cereus vegetative cells (1 x 10 8 colony-forming units [CFU]/mL) were inoculated in LWE-SM beverages with or without natural antimicrobial supplements: flavonol rich-cocoa powder (cocoanOX 12%, CCX) (700 ppm), vanillin (700 ppm), anise (700ppm), and cinnamon (700ppm). B. cereus cells were maintained at 10 degrees C for 10 days in the different beverages to test the bacteriostatic or inhibitory effect of the aforementioned ingredients. Beverages were treated with high hydrostatic pressure (HHP) technology and stored at 10 degrees C for 15 days after treatment. All natural antimicrobials reduced the mu(max) values and increased the lag phase time of B. cereus, and Gompertz growth curves showed different inhibitory effects depending on the substance. The maximum inhibitory effect (1.330 log cycle reduction) was achieved in LWE-SM-cinnamon-supplemented beverage. The maximum inactivation achieved by HHP in LWE-SM beverage was a reduction of around 3.89 +/- 0.25 log cycles at 300 MPa for 12 minutes. When supplemented beverages were treated under the same conditions, enhanced inactivation levels were achieved. This increased inactivation can be attributed to a synergistic effect when the LWE-SM was supplemented with flavonol-rich cocoa powder, cinnamon, and vanillin. The maximum synergistic effect was observed in LWE-SM-CCX-supplemented beverage.

The study aim was to determine if a relationship exists between MetS and chronic periodontitis in adult Colombians. Participants were 220 healthy-gingivitis subjects and 431 periodontitis patients coming from the three largest Colombian cities. Periodontal status and MetS were determined in subjects. Univariate analysis and odds ratio were calculated within the 95 % confidence intervals and chi(2) test compared the groups. Variables were compared among the clinical periodontal groups and MetS by Wilcoxon and multivariate analysis, and logistic regression was performed for MetS and periodontitis. MetS had higher prevalence in periodontitis group (6.3 %) versus controls (3.2 %). In multivariate analysis, periodontitis was associated with MetS (adjusted OR = 2.72, 95 % CI 1.09-6.79), glucose intolerance with another component of MetS (adjusted OR = 1.78, 1.16 to 2.72), glucose resistance (adjusted OR = 11.46, 95 % CI 1.41-92.88), smoking (OR = 1.72, 95 % CI 1.09-2.71), and city of origin (2.69, 95 % CI 1.79-4.04).

In Cali, Colombia, fixed cameras were installed in March 2012 on a number of roads and intersections. All camera devices are capable of detecting simultaneously the following traffic violations: driving over the speed limit, running a red light or stop sign, violation of the traffic ban schedule, and blocking the pedestrian crosswalk. Objective: To evaluate the impact of camera enforcement of traffic violations in Cali, Colombia. Methods: A quasi-experimental difference-in-differences study with before and after measurements and a comparison group was conducted. We observed 38 intervention areas and 50 comparison areas (250 m radius), during 42 months before and 34 months after the installation of cameras. Effects were estimated with mixed negative binomial regression models. Results: In intervention areas, after 12 months, there was a reduction of 19.2% of all crashes and a 24.7% reduction of injury and fatal crashes. In comparison areas, this reduction was 15.0% for all crashes and 20.1% for injury and fatal crashes. After adjusted comparisons, intervention sites outperformed comparison sites with an additional yearly reduction of 5.3% (p = 0.045) for all crashes.

Recently, an update of the diagnostic criteria (Chicago 3.0) has been published. The aim of this study was to compare the performance criteria of Chicago version 2.0 (CC2.0) vs. 3.0 (CC3.0) in a cohort of healthy volunteers and symptomatic patients. METHODS: HRM studies of asymptomatic and symptomatic individuals from several centers of Spain and Latin America were analyzed using both CC2.0 and CC3.0. The final diagnosis was grouped into hierarchical categories: obstruction (achalasia and gastro-esophageal junction obstruction), major disorders (distal esophageal spasm, absent peristalsis, and jackhammer), minor disorders (failed frequent peristalsis, weak peristalsis with small or large defects, ineffective esophageal motility, fragmented peristalsis, rapid contractile with normal latency and hypertensive peristalsis) and normal. The results were compared using McNemar's and Kappa tests. RESULTS: HRM was analyzed in 107 healthy volunteers (53.3% female; 18-69 years) and 400 symptomatic patients (58.5% female; 18-90 years). In healthy volunteers, using CC2.0 and CC3.0, obstructive disorders were diagnosed in 7.5% and 5.6%, respectively, major disorders in 1% and 2.8%, respectively, minor disorders in 25.2% and 15%, respectively, and normal in 66.4% and 76.6%, respectively. In symptomatic individuals, using CC2.0 and CC3.0, obstructive disorders were diagnosed in 11% and 11.3%, respectively, major disorders in 14% and 14%, respectively, minor disorders in 33.3% and 24.5%, respectively, and normal in 41.8% and 50.3%, respectively. In both groups of individuals, only an increase in normal and a decrease in minor findings using CC3.0 were statistically significant using McNemar's test. DISCUSSIONS: CC3.0 increases the number of normal studies when compared with CC2.0, essentially at the expense of fewer minor disorders, with no significant differences in major or obstructive disorders.

However, there is a need for additional studies that determine the preventive effects of different doses of zinc on URTI and diarrhoeal disease episodes in children. Methods: In a randomised, triple-blind clinical trial, we evaluated the efficacy of 12 months of daily zinc supplementation in the incidence of URTI and acute diarrhoea in a population of healthy children aged between 6 and 12 months living in Bogota, Colombia. The outcomes analysed were incidence of URTI, acute diarrhoea( disease episodes, and side effects of the interventions. Results: Between 2010 and 2013, a total of 355 children underwent randomisation, with 174 assigned to the zinc supplementation group and 181 to the control group. In the multivariate analyses, having been randomised to the non-supplemented control group (IRR 1.73, 95% CI 1.52-1.97, p < 0.001), and nursery attendance (IRR 1.41, 95% CI 1.07-1.87, p = 0.016) were independently linked to the number of URTI. Likewise, having been randomised to the non supplemented group (IRR 1.43, 95% CI 1.20-1.71, p < 0.001), and lower socioeconomic status (IRR 1.86, 95% CI 1.11-3.13, p = 0.018) were independently associated to the number of diarrhoeal disease episodes.

Methods: This is a secondary analysis of the Dementia Study of Western Norway (Demvest). For this study, we analysed a sample of 186 patients, 116 with AD and 70 with DLB. Subjects were included at a time in which mild dementia was diagnosed according to consensus criteria after comprehensive standardized assessment. Frailty was evaluated retrospectively using a frailty index generated from existing data. The cut-off value used to classify an older adult as frail was 0.25. Results: The prevalence of frailty was 25.81% (n = 48). In the DLB group, 37.14% (n = 26) were classified as frail, compared to 18.97% (n = 22) of those with AD (p < 0.001). The adjusted multivariate analysis revealed an OR of 2.45 (1.15-5.23) for being frail in those with DLB when using AD as the reference group. Conclusion: Frailty was higher than expected in both types of dementia. The prevalence of frailty was higher in those with DLB compared to AD.

AbstractPurposeHigh blood pressure is a relevant risk factor for vascular damage, leading to the development of depressive symptoms and dementia in older adults. Moreover, subjective memory complaints are recognized as an early marker of cognitive impairment. However, it has been established that subjective memory complaints could also be a reflection of depressive symptoms. The objective of this paper is to assess the impact of depressive symptoms and subjective memory complaints on the incidence of cognitive impairment in older adults with high blood pressure.MethodsThis is a secondary analysis of the Mexican Health and Aging Study, a representative cohort composed by individuals aged 50years. Participants with cognitive impairment in 2012 were excluded since the outcome was incident cognitive impairment in 2015. Four groups were created according to depressive symptomatology and subjective memory complaints status; analyses were stratified according to blood pressure status. The odds incident cognitive impairment was estimated through logistic regression models.ResultsA total of 6327 participants were included, from which 6.44% developed cognitive impairment. No differences were seen regarding the development of cognitive impairment in participants without high blood pressure.

Design: We calculated age-and sex-specific Z-scores for BMI, ASF, waist circumference, waist-to-height ratio and three other skinfold-thickness sites. Logistic regression with stepwise selection (P=0.80 for entry and P=0.05 for retention) was performed to identify predictors of IR and extreme IR, which were determined by age-and sex-specific Z-scores to identify the >= 90th and >= 95th percentile of homeostasis model assessment (HOMA(IR)), respectively. We used receiver operating characteristic curves to compare the area under the curve between models. Setting: Bucaramanga, Colombia. Subjects: Children (n 1261) aged 6-10 years in Tanner stage 1 from a population-based study. Results: A total of 127 children (seventy girls and fifty-seven boys) were classified with IR, including sixty-three children (thirty-three girls and thirty boys) classified with extreme IR. Only ASF and BMI Z-scores were retained as predictors of IR by stepwise selection. Adding ASF Z-score to BMI Z-score improved the area under the curve from 0.794 (95% CI 0.752, 0.837) to 0.811 (95% CI 0.770, 0.851; P for contrast=0.01). In predicting extreme IR, the addition of ASF Z-score to BMI Z-score improved the area under the curve from 0.837 (95% CI 0.790, 0.884) to 0.864 (95% CI 0.823, 0.905; P for contrast=0.01). Conclusions: ASF Z-score predicted IR independent of BMI Z-score in our population of prepubertal children.

Objectives To examine stillbirth and infant and child mortality among those affected by spina bifida using data from multiple countries. Methods We conducted an observational study, using data from 24 population- and hospital-based surveillance registries in 18 countries contributing as members of the International Clearinghouse for Birth Defects Surveillance and Research (ICBDSR). Cases of spina bifida that resulted in livebirths or stillbirths from 20 weeks' gestation or elective termination of pregnancy for fetal anomaly (ETOPFA) were included. Among liveborn spina bifida cases, we calculated mortality at different ages as number of deaths among liveborn cases divided by total number of liveborn cases with spina bifida. As a secondary outcome measure, we estimated the prevalence of spina bifida per 10 000 total births. The 95% confidence interval for the prevalence estimate was estimated using the Poisson approximation of binomial distribution. Results Between years 2001 and 2012, the overall first-week mortality proportion was 6.9% (95% CI 6.3, 7.7) and was lower in programmes operating in countries with policies that allowed ETOPFA compared with their counterparts (5.9% vs. 8.4%). The majority of first-week mortality occurred on the first day of life. In programmes where information on long-term mortality was available through linkage to administrative databases, survival at 5 years of age was 90%-96% in Europe, and 86%-96% in North America. Conclusions Our multi-country study showed a high proportion of stillbirth and infant and child deaths among those with spina bifida.

Study design: We included all neonates born between January 2004 and August 2007 registered in the ECLAMC database. Maternal prenatal multivitamin use was assessed for 122 newborns with congenital genitourinary tract anomalies and then compared to 271 non-malformed controls. Results: 46,850 births were registered and 122 (26/10,000) of them were identified to have a genitourinary tract anomaly. Prenatal multivitamin supplementation during the first, second, and third trimesters of pregnancy was associated with a reduction in the risk of these anomalies: OR 0.16 (0.08-0.31), OR 0.31 (0.19-0.52), and OR 0.38 (0.23-0.63) respectively.

,,,15,WOS:000440394200001,2018,"Detection of Helicobacter pylori in drinking water treatment plants in Bogota, Colombia, using cultural and molecular techniques","Helicobacter pylori is one of the most common causes of chronic bacterial infection in humans, and a predisposing factor for peptic ulcer and gastric cancer. The infection has been consistently associated with lack of access to clean water and proper sanitation. H. pylori has been detected in surface water, wastewater and drinking water. However, its ability to survive in an infectious state in the environment is hindered because it rapidly loses its cultivability. The aim of this study was to determine the presence of cultivable and therefore viable H. pylori in influent and effluent water from drinking water treatment plants (DWTP). A total of 310 influent and effluent water samples were collected from three drinking water treatment plants located at Bogota city, Colombia. Specific detection of H. pylori was achieved by culture, qPCR and FISH techniques. Fifty-six positive H. pylori cultures were obtained from the water samples. Characteristic colonies were covered by the growth of a large number of other bacteria present In the water samples, making isolation difficult to perform. Thus, the mixed cultures were submitted to Fluorescent in situ Hybridization (FISH) and qPCR analysis, followed by sequencing of the amplicons for confirmation. By qPCR, 77 water samples, both from the influent and the effluent, were positive for the presence of H. pylori. The results of our study demonstrate that viable H. pylori cells were present In both, influent and effluent water samples obtained from drinking water treatment plants in Bogota and provide further evidence that contaminated water may act as a transmission vehicle for H. pylori. Moreover, FISH and qPCR methods result rapid and specific techniques to identify H. pylori from complex environmental samples such as influent water.",Article,"Vesga, F.J.; Moreno, Y.; Ferrus, M.A.; Campos, C.; Trespalacios, A.A.",Helicobacter pylori; Detection; Culture; qPCR; FISH; Drinking water treatment plants,Helicobacter pylori;Detection;Culture;qPCR;FISH;Drinking water treatment plants;IN-SITU HYBRIDIZATION;DIRECT VIABLE COUNT;REAL-TIME PCR;RIVER WATER;SURVIVAL;DNA;CAMPYLOBACTER;COMBINATION;PREVALENCE;VIABILITY,Colombia;Spain,2-s2.0-85046168167

For this analysis, we used data from 4,474 participants included as a subsample with grip strength measurements. The frailty syndrome was diagnosed according to the Fried criteria (weakness, low speed, low physical activity, exhaustion, and weight loss). The independent variables were grouped as (a) biological and genetic flow, (b) lifestyle (adverse conditions in childhood) (c) social networks and community, and (d) socio-economic, cultural and environmental conditions. Multiple logistic and linear regression analyses were used to assess the prognostic value of frailty for the outcomes of interest. Results: The prevalence of frailty was 17.9%. The factors significantly associated with frailty were older age, being women, living in rural areas, having low education, a greater number of medical conditions, insufficient current income, childhood health problems and a poor economic situation in childhood.

,,,13,WOS:000362251400003,2015,"Characterising atypical Candida albicans clinical isolates from six third-level hospitals in Bogota, Colombia","Background: Candida species are the most frequently found fungal pathogens causing nosocomial disease in a hospital setting. Such species must be correctly identified to ensure that appropriate control measures are taken and that suitable treatment is given for each species. Candida albicans is causing most fungal disease burden worldwide; the challenge lies in differentiating it from emerging atypical, minor and related species such as Candida dubliniensis and Candida africana. The purpose of this study was to compare identification based on MALDI-TOF MS to standard identification systems using a set of nosocomial isolates. Methods: Eleven nosocomial samples were collected from 6 third-level hospitals in Bogota, Colombia. All the samples were identified by combining MALDI-TOF MS with morphological characters, carbohydrate assimilation and molecular markers (D1/D2 and HWP1). Results: The present work describes the first collection of atypical Colombian Candida clinical isolates; these were identified as Candida albicans/Candida africana by their MALDI-TOF MS profile. Phenotypical characteristics showed that they were unable to produce chlamydospores, assimilate trehalose, glucosamine, N-acetyl-glucosamine and barely grew at 42 degrees C, as would be expected for Candida africana. The molecular identification of the D1/D2 region of large subunit ribosomal RNA and HWP1 hyphal cell wall protein 1 sequences from these isolates was consistent with those for Candida albicans. The mass spectra obtained by MALDI-TOF MS were analysed by multi-dimensional scaling (MDS) and cluster analysis, differences being revealed between Candida albicans, Candida africana, Candida dubliniensis reference spectra and two clinical isolate groups which clustered according to the clinical setting, one of them being clearly related to C. albicans. Conclusion: This study highlights the importance of using MALDI-TOF MS in combination with morphology, substrate assimilation and molecular markers for characterising Candida albicans-related and atypical C. albicans species, thereby overcoming conventional identification methods. This is the first report of hospital-obtained isolates of this type in Colombia; the approach followed might be useful for gathering knowledge regarding local epidemiology which could, in turn, have an impact on clinical management.

METHODS Cross-sectional study included 23 municipalities of Santander, Colombia. Serological IFAT and ELISA tests were undertaken to detect IgG anti-Trypanosoma cruzi. A questionnaire was conducted for assessing the risk factors of each participant. Newborns were evaluated at birth and followed up to 1 year of age to determine congenital infection. RESULTS An overall prevalence of 3.2% (95% CI 2.4-4.2) among 1518 pregnant women was detected. Prevalences by provinces were as follows: Guanentina: 6.0% (95% CI 4.1-8.5), Garcia Rovira: 2.9% (95% CI: 1.5-4.8) and Comunera: 0.4% (0.4-2.3). The main risk factors identified were age >32 years old (OR: 2.1; 95% CI: 1.1-3.9); currently having a thatched roof (OR: 11.8; CI95% 2.2-63.2) and a thatched roof during childhood (OR: 3.0; 95% CI: 1.4-6.6); having below primary school education level (OR: 4.6; 95% CI: 2.2-9.5); and a history of a close contact with the vector (triatomine bugs) at least once during their lifetime (OR: 6.9; 95% CI: 3.7-12.9). No congenital cases were detected by parasitological or serological techniques. CONCLUSIONS Prevalence of Chagas disease in pregnant women is a potential source of infection in this Colombian endemic area.

Health care systems are seeking ways to leverage technology to screen, evaluate, and treat these conditions, because workforce interventions alone, particularly in low- and middle-income countries, are insufficient. This article reports data from the first year of implementation of a technology-supported, systematic approach to identify and care for persons with these disorders in primary care in Colombia. Methods: A care process that includes waiting room kiosks to screen primary care patients, decision support tablets to guide doctors in diagnosis and treatment, and access to digital therapeutics as a treatment option was implemented in two primary care clinics, one urban and one in a small town. The project collected data on the number of people screened, diagnosed, and engaged in the research and their demographic characteristics. Results: In the first year, 2,656 individuals were screened for depression and unhealthy alcohol use in the two clinics. Primary care doctors increased the percentage of patients diagnosed as having depression and alcohol use disorder from next to 0% to 17% and 2%, respectively. Conclusions: Early experience with implementing technology-supported screening and decision support for depression and alcohol use disorder into the workflow of busy primary care clinics in Colombia indicates that this care model is feasible and leads to dramatically higher rates of diagnoses of these conditions.

The aim of this study was to assess sleep disturbances among medical students, and whether associations with academic performance, depressive symptoms or substance use were present. Methods: Cross-sectional study in which 544 medical students of the Pontificia Universidad Javeriana in Bogota, Colombia were included. Using a computer-based survey, self-reported variables were assessed, including demographics, Pittsburgh Sleep Quality Index (PSQI), Epworth Sleepiness Scale (ESS), Berlin Questionnaire, Diagnostic and Statistical Manual of Mental Disorders (DSM) - IV depression criteria, Grade Point Average (GPA), and substance use. Associations between these variables were obtained. Results: Fifty-four percent of students were women. Poor sleep quality (PSQI>5) and daytime sleepiness (ESS>10) were found in 65% of the population. A higher GPA was more frequent in students with good sleep quality (OR= 2.6 [1.5-4.5]), lack of daytime sleepiness (OR= 2 [1.3-3.1]) and low risk of Obstructive Sleep Apnea Syndrome (OSAS) (OR= 3.1 [1.6-5.9]). DSM-IV depression criteria were fulfilled by 26% of the students and were associated with poor sleep patterns. Energy drinks use was associated with poor sleep quality.

The aim of this study was to evaluate the risk factors associated with MRSA SSTI in Colombia. Methods: A multicenter cohort study with nested case-control design was performed. Patients with an SSTI with at least 48 h of inpatient care were included. Patients with an MRSA SSTI were considered the case group and patients with either a non-MRSA SSTI or with an Methicillin-susceptible S. aureus (MSSA) SSTI were the control groups. A multivariate logistic regression approach was used to evaluate risk factors associated with MRSA SSTI with two different statistical models. Results: A total 1134 patients were included. Cultures were positive for 498 patients, of which 52% (n = 259) were Staphylococcus aureus. MRSA was confirmed in 68.3% of the S. aureus cultures. In the first model, independent risk factors for MRSA SSTI were identified as the presence of abscess (P < 0.0001), cellulitis (P = 0.0007), age 18-44 years (P = 0.001), and previous outpatient treatment in the previous index visit (P = 0.003); surgical site infection was a protective factor (P = 0.008). In the second model, the main risk factor found was previous outpatient treatment in the previous index visit (P = 0.013). Conclusions: Community-acquired SSTIs in Colombia are commonly caused by MRSA. Therefore, clinicians should consider MRSA when designing the initial empirical treatment for purulent SSTI in Colombia, although there seems to be low awareness of this fact. (C) 2019 The Authors.

Methods: An analytical matched case-control study was conducted with 210 controls and 210 patients with NSCLP. The patients were classified into 3 groups: complete right unilateral cleft lip and palate (RCLP), complete left unilateral cleft lip and palate (LCLP), and complete bilateral cleft lip and palate (BCLP). Univariate and multivariate Poisson regression models were used to analyze paired samples (Bonferroni adjustment, P <= .002). Results: A high risk of finding agenesis of the maxillary lateral incisors, supernumerary teeth, microdontia of the maxillary lateral incisors, and rotation of the maxillary central incisors adjacent to the cleft (P < .0001) was observed in the patients with NSCLP. One or more dental anomalies were found in 98% of patients with BCLP, in 96% of those with LCLP, and in 87% of those with RCLP. Most of the anomalies were located on the cleft area.

It has been reported that the incidence of RCC is rising. These changes are more common in developed countries because of better screening programs and disease registry. The aim of this article is to review the epidemiology of RCC around the world. Methods: A literature review of four databases was performed: PubMed, Embase, Lilacs, and Scielo. Studies of incidence, prevalence, mortality, and survival of RCC were taken from different countries. Studies included were published in the last 10 years. Two reviewers independently selected the studies. Results: A total of 5275 references were reviewed by title and abstract. In the end, 42 references were selected for full-text review. The global incidence and prevalence of cancer vary. The highest incidence was described in North America and Northern Europe. In Canada, by 2007 the incidence was 17.9/100 000 and 10.3/100 000 in males and females, respectively. Developing countries like Colombia have fewer incidence rates, with less information in poor-income areas. Conclusions: We have seen a rise in the incidence and mortality of RCC globally. There is an association between RCC and smoking, obesity, hypertension, and socioeconomic status. Seeing the epidemiological data from some regions in developing countries and the lack of specialists in those places, it can be deduced there is underreporting of the disease that reveals the need to improve both surveillance and disease registration programs, especially in these countries.",Review,"Medina-Rico, M.; Ramos, H.L.; Lobo, M.; Romo, J.; Prada, J.G.",,KIDNEY CANCER;CELL CARCINOMA;UNITED-STATES;MORTALITY;TRENDS;SURVIVAL;POPULATION;PREVALENCE;EUROPE;ENGLAND,Colombia,2-s2.0-85045319141;2-s2.0-85040450363;2-s2.0-85040450363

Human papillomavirus (HPV) vaccines are a promising alternative for disease control; however, their introduction is slow in settings with greater need. We conducted a review of HPV vaccine efficacy and effectiveness reported in clinical trials and population-based studies. Efficacy of HPV vaccines is close to 100% when using a three-dose schedule in HPV-negative young women (<25 years old) for protection against persistent infection and HPV vaccine-type associated pre-cancerous lesions. Furthermore, sustained protection for up to 12 years of follow-up has been demonstrated; cross-protection against non-vaccine types is particularly observed for the bivalent vaccine, and preliminary data regarding impact on invasive cancer have emerged. Given its lower efficacy, catch-up vaccination beyond 19 years of age and proposals for vaccinating adult women deserve careful evaluation in accurately designed studies and economic analyses. Despite positive results regarding immunogenicity and post-hoc analysis for cervical intra-epithelial neoplasia in clinical trials, population-based data for prime and booster two-dose schedules are not available. Evaluation of vaccine safety from surveillance systems in immunization programs that have already distributed more than 270 million doses found no association of HPV vaccination with serious side effects. The introduction of HPV vaccination in national immunization programs remains the main challenge in tackling the burden of cervical cancer (up to 2018, only 89 countries have introduced vaccination worldwide, and most of these are high-income countries). Access models and technical capacity require further development to help low- and middle-income countries to increase the pace of vaccine delivery. Alternative approaches such as one-dose schedules and vaccination at younger ages may help reduce the programmatic and economic challenges to adolescent vaccination.",Review,"Murillo, R.; Ordonez-Reyes, C.",papillomavirus vaccines; uterine cervical neoplasms; cervical intraepithelial neoplasia; immunisation programs; primary prevention; population impact; clinical efficacy; safety,papillomavirus vaccines;uterine cervical neoplasms;cervical intraepithelial neoplasia;immunisation programs;primary prevention;population impact;clinical efficacy;safety;MIDDLE-INCOME COUNTRIES;GRADE CERVICAL LESIONS;COST-EFFECTIVENESS;UNIVERSAL VACCINATION;HERD-IMMUNITY;CANCER;IMPACT;VACCINES;PREVALENCE;CHALLENGES,Colombia,2-s2.0-85071775286

OBJECTIVE: The aim of the study was to assess LDL-C goal achievement in International ChoLesterol management Practice Study participants with familial hypercholesterolemia (FH). METHODS: A total of 334 patients (aged >= 18 years) with definite or probable FH (Dutch Lipid Clinic Network score >= 6; 43.1% genetically confirmed) who had been receiving stable lipid modifying therapy (LMT) for >= 3 months were enrolled. RESULTS: The mean standard deviation age of the patients was 58.5 +/- 13.1 years, 49.1% were male, and 48.2% had coronary artery disease. Most were receiving statin (similar to 99%). Of these, 57.6% were on high-intensity statin therapy, 49.1% on the highest dose available, and 13.0% used a statin together with a cholesterol absorption inhibitor (CAI). Mean +/- standard deviation LDL-C level was 5.6 +/- 3.0 mmol/L before LMT and 3.3 +/- 2.0 mmol/L at enrollment. Overall, 32.0% of patients achieved their LDL-C target. Target achievement rates were 36.6% for patients with coronary artery disease, and 27.5% for those without, and 27.9%, 28.0%, and 37.5% for patients treated with a statin plus CAI, highest-dose statin (no CAI), and lower-dose statin (no CAI), respectively. CONCLUSIONS: LDL-C target achievement rates were low in patients with FH, even in those receiving intensive LMT. Factors that are likely to have contributed to the low LDL-C target achievement rates include high baseline LDL-C, inadequate statin dosages, and low use of CAI. Many patients would have been eligible for proprotein convertase subtilisin/kexin type 9 inhibitor therapy. (C) 2019 National Lipid Association.

Patients on hemodialysis and HIV-infected were prospectively followed between July 2011 and June 2012 in Bogota, Colombia. Nasal and axillary swabs were obtained and cultured. Colonizing S. aureus isolates were identified by standard and molecular techniques. Molecular typing was performed by using pulse-field gel electrophoresis and evaluating the presence of lukF-PV/lukS-PV by PCR. A total of 29% (n = 82) of HIV-infected and 45.5% (n = 15) of patients on hemodialysis exhibited S. aureus colonization. MSSA/MRSA colonization was observed in 28% and 3.6% of the HIV patients, respectively and in 42.4% and 13.3% of the hemodialysis patients, respectively. Staphylococcal cassette chromosome mec typing showed that four MRSA isolates harbored the type IV cassette, and one type I. In the hemodialysis group, two MRSA isolates were classified as belonging to the USA300-LV genetic lineage. Conversely, in the HIV infected group, no colonizing isolates belonging to the USA300-Latin American Variant (UDA300-LV) lineage were identified. Colonizing isolates recovered from the HIV-infected group belonged to the prevalent hospital-associated clones circulating in Latin America (Chilean [n = 1] and Pediatric [n = 2]).

Research shows that child maltreatment increases the risk for substance use and problems. Thus, recognition of this relationship may have important implications for substance demand reduction strategies, including efforts to prevent and treat substance use and related problems.

To date, relatively little work has addressed the link between child maltreatment and substance use in the region. A working group constituted by the Inter-American Drug Abuse Control Commission (CICAD) and the Centre for Addiction and Mental Health (CAMH) in June, 2010 identified this area as a priority area for a multinational research partnership. This paper summarizes existing information on drug use and child maltreatment in six participating countries, Colombia, El Salvador, Jamaica, Nicaragua, Panama and Uruguay, and considers the implications of child maltreatment prevention for demand reduction strategies to address substance use issues.

Randomized clinical trials have identified successful strategies in T2D prevention. However, translating these results to real-life scenarios and adapting to ethnocultural differences is a major challenge. Transculturalization allows incorporating cultural factors to diabetes prevention strategies to optimize implementation of clinical trials results. The purpose of this paper is to review the transcultural adaptations developed for T2D prevention in Latin America (LA). METHODS A comprehensive literature review spanning 1960-2016 was performed, using"" Diabetes,""""Latin America,""""Prevention,""""Screening,"" and ""Tools"" as key words. RESULTS Two major tasks are underway in LA: adaptation of screening tools for high-risk individuals, and implementation of diabetes prevention programs. The Finnish Diabetes Risk Score (FINDRISC) is the most widely used screening tool to detect new cases of T2D and people with prediabetes, and it has been adapted (LA-FINDRISC) to include the waist circumference cutoff values appropriate for LA population (>= 94 cm for men and >= 90 cm for women). The validation of the LA-FINDRISC performance depends on the local characteristics. A LA-FINDRISC score >10 may be the best cutoff to identify individuals with impaired glucose regulation in population-based studies, but a higher score (>12-14) might be more appropriate in a clinical setting. A shorter version of the FINDRISC using only the 4 variables with highest impact has been developed and validated in Colombia (ColDRISC). The translation of the Diabetes Prevention Program study in a Latino population in Venezuela found a significant improvement in cardiometabolic risk factors. An adaptation of the Diabetes Prevention Study in the DEMOJUAN study in Barranquilla, Colombia, reduced 2-hour postload glucose.

Geographical cluster distribution analysis in South America,"Objective Hypospadias is the most common congenital anomaly affecting the genitals. It has been established as a multifactorial disease with increasing prevalence. Many risk factors have been identified such as prematurity, birth weight, mother's age, and exposure to endocrine disruptors. In recent decades multiple authors using surveillance systems have described an increase in prevalence of hypospadias, but most of the published literature comes from developed countries in Europe and North America and few of the published studies have involved cluster analysis. Few large-scale studies have been performed addressing the effect of altitude and other geographical aspects on the development of hypospadias. Acknowledging this limitation, we present novel results of a multinational spatial scan statistical analysis over a 30-year period in South America and an altitude analysis of hypospadias distribution on a continent level. Method A retrospective review was performed of the Latin American collaborative study of congenital malformations (ECLAMC). A total of 4,020,384 newborns was surveyed between 1982 and December 2011 in all participating centers. We selected all patients with hypospadias. All degrees of clinical severity were included in the analysis. Each participating center was geographically identified with its coordinates and altitude above sea level. A spatial scan statistical analysis was performed using Kulldorf's methodology and a prevalence trend analysis over time in centers below and above 2000 m. Results During the study period we found 159 hospitals in six different countries (Colombia, Bolivia, Brazil, Argentina, Chile, and Uruguay) with 4,537 cases of hypospadias and a global prevalence rate of 11.3/10,000 newborns. Trend analysis showed that centers below 2000 m had an increasing trend with an average of 10/10,000 newborns as opposed to those centers above 2000 m that showed a reducing trend with an average prevalence of 7.8 (p = 0.1246). We identified clusters with significant increases of prevalence in five centers along the coast at an average altitude of 219.8 m above sea level (p > 0.0000). Reduction in prevalence was found in clusters located in two centers on the Andes mountains. Altitude of 2,000 m was associated with hypospadias (Figure), with an OR 0.59 (0.5-0.69). There are ethnic arguments to support our results supported by protective polymorphism distribution in high lands. Conclusion Altitude above 2,000 m is suggested to have a protective effect for hypospadias. Specific clusters have been identified with increased risk for hypospadias. Environmental risk factors in these areas need to be further studied given the association seen between altitude and the distribution of more severe cases.",Article,"Fernandez, N.; Lorenzo, A.; Bagli, D.; Zarante, I.",Hypospadias; Prevalence; Geographic clusters; Spatial analysis; ECLAMC,Hypospadias;Prevalence;Geographic clusters;Spatial analysis;ECLAMC;BIRTH-DEFECTS;TRENDS;ABNORMALITIES;ASSOCIATION,Colombia;Canada,2-s2.0-84971592076

Streptococcus pneumoniae is a commonly implicated agent in invasive disease. For infections of S. pneumoniae resistant to beta-lactam. macrolides are an alternative treatment. However, resistance to macrolides has increased worldwide as well. Objective. The frequency of resistance to erythromycin was determined for S. pneumoniae over a 15-year surveillance period, and the resistant isolates were characterized phenotypically and genotypically. Materials and methods. Demographic data of the patients, antimicrobial susceptibility and serotypes were analyzed for 3,241 S. pneumoniae isolates recovered between 1994 and 2008. The phenotypes were determined by the double-disc technique and genotypes by PCR (polymerase chain reaction) and PFGE (pulsed field gel electrophoresis). Isolates were recovered from invasive diseases and were provided by national public health laboratories. Results. Of the 3,241 isolates, 136 were resistant to erythromycin. In the 12-year period between 19941996 and 2006-2008, resistance in each 2-year sampling had increased from 2.4% to 6.9% in children under 6 years and from 3.3% to 5.7% in adults. The most common serotypes were 6B (36.8%). 14 (16.9%) and 6A (17.6%). Constitutive phenotype cMLSB was determined in 87 isolates; 82 of these expressed the ermB gene. Phenotype M was determined in 46 isolates; 45 had the mefA gene. An additional three isolates expressed the inducible phenotype (iMLS(B)), and one expressed the ermB gene. By PFGE, 50 of the isolates were found to be related to international clones-58% were Spain(6B)-ST90, 26% Spain(9V)-ST156, 8% Colombia(23F)-ST338 and 8% Spain(23F)-ST81. Conclusion. The increase in erythromycin resistance was primarily related to the mechanism of ribosomal methylation. More than half the cases were congeneric with the clone Spain(6B)-ST90 that has been circulating in Colombia since 1994.",Article,"Hidalgo, M.; Santos, C.; Duarte, C.; Castaneda, E.; Agudelo, C.I.",Streptococcus pneumoniae; erythromycin; drug resistance; surveillance; genotype; phenotype,Streptococcus pneumoniae;erythromycin;drug resistance;surveillance;genotype;phenotype;INVASIVE PNEUMOCOCCAL DISEASE;MACROLIDE RESISTANCE;CLONES;INFECTIONS;MEF;DETERMINANTS;POPULATION;PREVALENCE;PHENOTYPES,Colombia,

We have studied the socioeconomic inequalities in current smoking, ever smoking, and smoking cessation in Colombia by age-group and gender. Methods: Sixty thousand, three hundred and forty-nine Colombian men and women aged 12-69 years were selected at random from the results of a national survey. We used Pearson's chi-square and Robust Poisson regression analyses to estimate adjusted prevalence ratios between smoking behaviors and 2 indicators of socioeconomic position; individuals' educational level and household socioeconomic stratum. Results: In men aged 45-69 years, higher socioeconomic stratum and higher education were associated with a lower rate of current smoking (PR = 0.49 [95% CI, 0.32-0.73] and PR = 0.64 [95% CI, 0.47-0.86], respectively), a history of smoking (PR = 0.67 [95% CI, 0.53-0.85] and PR = 0.75 [95% CI, 0.63-0.90], respectively), or a higher rate of smoking cessation (PR = 1.37 [95% CI, 1.09-1.72] and PR = 0.18 [95% CI, 0.99-1.72], respectively). In men aged 18-44 years, higher education was associated with lower odds of current and history of smoking (PR = 0.75 [95% CI, 0.61-0.92 and PR = 0.81 [95% CI, 0.67-0.98], respectively). Results in women and adolescents were mixed.

Implementation of food safety management systems such as Hazard Analysis and Critical Control Points in swine abattoirs can help to mitigate pathogen exposure. The objective of the present study was to evaluate the impact of the HACCP system in slaughterhouses in Colombia on reducing Salmonella spp. exposure due to the consumption of fresh pork meat. Two slaughtering plants with a different degree of HACCP implementation were selected and a quantitative microbiological mapping was built by collecting 820 samples of Salmonella spp. enumeration at different processing stages. The overall Salmonella spp. mean concentration was 1.15 +/- 0.55 log MPN/g, with no significant differences among plants (P > 0.05). Deficiencies during carcass disinfection and temperature during distribution of meat cuts from the slaughterhouse lacking of HACCP resulted in a significant increase of Salmonella spp. prevalence (20-40%) (P < 0.05). Processing stages with the highest pathogen prevalence were transport (28-32%) and hanging (16-36%). The exposure assessment model estimated a higher degree of pathogen contamination at the time of consumption in meat cuts from the slaughterhouse without HACCP (3.36 versus 3.68 log MPN/g) and 10-fold increase in the probability a consumer would acquire a contaminated portion (0.011 versus 0.105).

Usher syndrome is a disorder characterized by progressive retinitis pigmentosa, prelingual sensory hearing loss and vestibular dysfunction. It is the most frequent cause of deaf-blindness in humans. Three clinical types and twelve genetic subtypes have been characterized. Type II is the most common, and among these cases, nearly 80% have mutations in the USH2A gene. Objective. The aim of the study was to establish the mutational frequencies for the short isoform of USH2A gene in Usher syndrome type II. Materials and methods. Twenty-six Colombian individuals with Usher syndrome type II were included. SSCP analysis for 20 exons of the short isoform was performed and abnormal patterns were sequenced. Sequencing of exon 13 of the USH2A gene was performed for all the individuals because the most frequent mutation is located in this exon. Results. The most frequent mutation was c.2299delG, identified in the 27% (n=8) of the sample. The second mutation, p.R334W, showed a frequency of 15%. A new variant identified in the 5'UTR region, g.129G>T, was present in 1 individual (4%). Four polymorphisms were identified; one of them is a new deletion in exon 20, first reported in this study.

Materials and methods: Presumptive Listeria isolates (314) were molecularly identified to discriminate among L monocytogenes, Listeria ivanovii, and Listeria species. Listeria monocytogenes serotypes were identified by polymerase chain reaction (PCR) and PCR-restriction enzyme analysis (PCR-REA) and tested for antimicrobial susceptibility. Results: Isolates were identified as L monocytogenes (259; 82.5%), L ivanovii (2; 0.6%), and Listeria species (53; 16.9%). Distribution of L monocytogenes serotypes: 4a/4c (0.4%), 4b (11.2%), 4d/4e (14%), 4b/4d/4e (9.3%), 1/2a (26.3%), 3a (7.7%), 1/2a/3a (6.2%), 1/2b/3b (1.2%), 1/2c (5%), 3c (1.2%), and 1/2c/3c (5.4%). Thirty-two L monocytogenes isolates (12.4%) were not typeable by PCR-REA, suggesting the possibility of serotypes 4ab/7. Susceptibility was 84.2% to 100% for most antimicrobials. Major resistance (R) and intermediate (I) susceptibility were found for clindamycin (R = 36.7%, I = 39.8% for L monocytogenes; R = 100% for L ivanovii; and R = 14%, I = 86% for Listeria species). Drugs of choice for treatment of human listeriosis (penicillin, ampicillin, and trimethoprim-sulfamethoxazole) remained effective; 1.2% of L monocytogenes were beta-lactam resistant. Multidrug resistance was found only in L monocytogenes (26.6%) and Listeria. species (26.4%), with (clindamycin(I) (or R) -erythromycin(R)-azithromycin(R)) and (ciprofloxacin(I)-clindamycin(I)) the most frequent phenotypes.

More studies are needed on risk factors, specifically in developing countries. This study explored the association of several factors and AR among urban residents in six cities of Colombia. Methodology:A cross-sectional study and a nested case-control study were carried out between 2009 and 2010 involving two Colombian subpopulations: children/adolescents and adults. Cases were affirmative respondents to ""In the past 12 months, have you (or your child) had a problem with sneezing or a running or blocked nose, when you (or your child) did not have a cold or the flur""""Controls""were subjects who never had been diagnosed with asthma, AR or atopic eczema by a physician, and whom did not report any symptoms in the past twelve months. Weighted logistic regression was used to assess the association of different factors with case/control status. Results:Factors associated with AR in children/adolescents were family history of AR, acetaminophen consumption and high socioeconomic status. Among adults, family history of asthma, AR and atopic eczema, and cetaminophen consumption were associated with AR. Consumption of cereals among children/adolescents and eating eggs among adults showed protective associations.

This study aimed to analyze the prevalence of MetS according to gender and aging stage, and its association with potential factors in older individuals >= 60 years of age in Colombia. Methods:The data for this study came from a secondary cross-sectional, nationally representative SABE study Survey on Health, Well-Being, and Aging in Colombia, 2015. A total of 1637 participants (60.7% women, 70.5 +/- 7.9 years) from 86 Colombian municipalities participated. A structured questionnaire was used to collect data on socio-demography, lifestyle, and self-report medical conditions. Measurements included anthropometric (weight, waist circumference, body mass index), sarcopenia ""proxy"" status (calf circumference) handgrip strength levels, high-density lipoprotein cholesterol, triglycerides, fasting glucose, and blood pressure. Univariate and multiple regression models were established as part of the main analysis. Results:Using the harmonized Joint Scientific Statement criteria, MetS was present in 54.9% of the study population, with a higher prevalence among females than males (59.8% vs. 47.3%). Individuals who were cigarette smokers (odds ratio [OR] = 1.5; 95% confidence interval [CI] = 1.0-2.4;P = 0.034), female gender (OR = 1.3; 95% CI = 1.0-1.8;P = 0.020), and sarcopenia ""proxy"" (OR = 1.6; 95% CI = 1.0-2.5;P = 0.026) were more likely to have a higher prevalence estimate of MetS, after controlling for relevant covariates. Conclusions:Overall prevalence of MetS among older adults in Colombia is high. Smoking, female gender, and sarcopenia ""proxy"" status are associated with MetS.

The discriminatory efficiency of the serological tests varies according to the disease prevalence and the test-antigen used. Objective: To evaluate the discriminatory efficiency of the commercial kit Chagas (Trypanosoma cruzi) IgG-ELISA (R) (Nova Tec Immunodiagnostica GmbBH) in a group of Colombian individuals, using indirect immunofluorescence antibody testing (IFAT) and enzyme immunoassay (ELISA) tests as references. Materials and methods: Seventy-eight samples from chronic chagasic patients (36 asymptomatic and 42 symptomatic) and 21 healthy controls were included. Seventeen samples from non-infected people with Chagas' disease epidemiological risk, seven with leishmaniasis and nine with non-chagasic cardiomyopathy were also analyzed. Real time PCR was performed on four individuals whose results differed among tests. Results: Significant differences at 450 nm optical absorbance were found (p < 0.0001) when the median absorbance values of healthy controls (0.143), asymptomatic (2.401) and symptomatic (2.776) chagasic patients were compared, as well as when asymptomatic and symptomatic patients (p = 0.0408) and seronegative people with epidemiological risk (0.232), cardiomyopathy (0.367) or leishmaniasis (0.337) were compared with chagasic patients (p < 0.0001). Finally, there were differences among healthy controls and non-infected people with epidemiological risk (p = 0.0264), patients with non-chagasic cardiomyopathy (p = 0.0015) and patients with leishmaniasis (p = 0.002).

Within this frame of reference, knowledge of antimicrobial susceptibility represents the fundamental approach of most Salmonella treatments. Therefore, scientific publications of antimicrobial susceptibilities and resistance must be precise, with interpretations adjusted to a particular standard. Hence, the three objectives in this study were: (i) to describe the frequency of antimicrobial-resistant isolates of Non-Typhoidal Salmonella (NTS) isolated from beef, pork, chicken meat, and other meat products; (ii) to describe the distribution of serovars and their multi-resistance to antibiotics for clinical use (veterinary and human) between 1996 and 2019; and (iii) to propose additional considerations that could improve the use and usefulness of the published results. Our results determined that the predominant isolates came from poultry. Enteritidis and Typhimurium were the most reported serovars by MIC (with both having the highest resistance to TET) while the lowest resistance was to CIP and CRO for Enteritidis and Typhimurium, respectively. The multi-resistance pattern AMP AMC CEP GEN KAN STR TET was the most frequently observed pattern by MIC in Montevideo and Seftenberg, while, for disc diffusion, the pattern AMP STR TET was the most frequent in the Bredeney serotype. In conclusion, researchers should carry out homogeneous sampling procedures, identify the types of the samples, use standard identification methods, and employ appropriate standards for antimicrobial susceptibility interpretation.

It is a frequent cause of disability in adults. Pain may be generated by different anatomical structures such as the facet joint. However, nowadays pain produced by the facet joint has no clinical diagnosis. Therefore, the purpose of this article is to propose a clinical diagnostic scale for lumbar facet syndrome. Materials and methods: The study was conducted by means of 6 phases as follows, Phase 1, a systematic review of the literature was performed regarding the clinical diagnosis of facet-based lumbar pain based on the PRISMA checklist; Phase 2, a list of signs and symptoms proposed for diagnosis lumbar pain of facet origin was made. Phase 3, the list of signs and symptoms found was submitted to a committee of experts to discriminate the most significant signs and symptoms, these were linked to general sociodemographic variables to develop an evaluation questionnaire; Phase 4, the evaluation questionnaire was applied, including those selected signs and symptoms to a group of patients with clinical diagnosis of facet disease lumbar pain and who underwent a selective facet block. Phase 5, under standard technique selective facet block and subsequent postoperative clinical control at 1 month. Phase 6, given pre and postsurgical results associated with signs present in the patients we propose a clinical scale of diagnosis scale. Descriptive statistics and Stata 12.0 were used as statistical software. Results: A total of 36 signs and symptoms were found for the diagnosis of lumbar facet syndrome that were submitted to the group of experts, where a total of 12 (8 symptoms and 4 signs) were included for the final survey. 31 patients underwent selective lumbar facet blockade, mostly women, with an average of 60 +/- 11.5 years, analogous visual scale of preoperative pain of 8/10, postoperative of 1.7/10, the signs and symptoms most frequently found included in a diagnostic scale were: 3 symptoms 1) axial or bilateral axial lumbar pain, 2) improvement with rest, 3) absence of root pattern, may have pseudoradicular pattern, however, the pain is greater lumbar than pain in the leg and 3 clinical signs 1) Kemp sign, 2) pain induced in joint or transverse process, 3) facet stress sign or Acevedo sign. Conclusion: The clinical diagnosis of lumbar facet pain is still debated. Few diagnostic scales have been postulated, with little or no external validity, so the present study proposes a diagnostic scale consisting of 3 symptoms and 3 clinical signs.

This is particularly true in Colombia. There, the number of individuals with dementia may increase five-fold by 2050. Yet research is lacking on dementia in such settings. This work estimates the prevalence of dementia in a community-dwelling population in Colombia. It also assesses how gender-based differences in cardiovascular conditions and socioeconomic disparities affect dementia. This work analyzes data on 2000 respondents at least 60 years of age in the Health, Well-Being, And Aging (SABE) study in Bogota. Respondents with dementia are those who have cognitive impairment and at least two limitations in instrumental activities of daily living. The SABE study finds 8.4% of respondents have dementia. Age, cardiovascular risks, and socioeconomic disparities contributed to higher odds of dementia. The contributors to dementia can differ for men and women. For example, socioeconomic disparities were a larger contributor to dementia for women than men. The findings support the cognitive reserve hypothesis on dementia. This holds that pre-existing cognitive processes and compensatory mechanisms influence dementia. Women in Latin America are more likely to suffer from socioeconomic disparities that limit their cognitive reserve.

Its initial evaluation showed strong psychometric properties. The aims of this study were to (a) translate and validate an international Spanish version of BEDQ and (b) evaluate its psychometric properties in a large Hispano-American sample of symptomatic individuals. Methods A Spanish BEDQ version was performed by Hispano-American experts using a Delphi process and reverse translation. Patients were prospectively recruited from seven centers in Spain and Latin America among individuals referred for high-resolution manometry (HRM). Patients completed several scores: Hospital Anxiety & Depression Scale (HADS), Eckardt score (ES), Gastroesophageal Reflux Questionnaire (GERDQ), and the BEDQ. Standardized psychometric analyses were performed. Key Results A total of 426 patients were recruited. Spanish BEDQ showed excellent reliability (Cronbach's alpha = 0.91). Factor analysis confirmed its unidimensional character. Moderate significant correlations between BEDQ and other symptomatic scores were found, suggesting sufficient convergent validity. Patients with abnormal or obstructive HRM findings scored significantly higher when compared to normal or non-obstructive findings, respectively. Using a cutoff of 10, BEDQ showed a sensitivity of 65.38% and a specificity of 66.21% and an area under the curve of 0.71 for obstructive or major manometric diagnosis.

Methods: BD in relatives, multi-impulsive behaviour (presence -of binges and purges associated with self-injuries, kleptomania, trichotilomania, or suicide attempt), substance abuse, and substance abuse in relatives, were compared in 62 Cases with ED and BD, and 262 Controls of the same clinical cohort with ED without BD. Diagnosis was made using SCID-1 and DSM IV criteria. Results: In this sample, 62 patients with BD of any type (19.1%) were found. Patients with BD and ED have a greater than 13-fold higher risk of familial bipolarity and multi-impulsive behaviour, compared with patients without this comorbidity (OR = 13.2, 95% Cl 6.3-27.6). Discussion: These findings agree with the hypothesis that EDS associated with multi-impulsivity, could be part of Bipolar II Spectrum. The early diagnosis of BD is crucial to decide the mood-stabilisers use as soon as possible and prevent greater chronicity, mood-cycle shortening and poor prognosis in both disorders.

Description of a hospital based population in South America,"Introduction: Hypospadias is a congenital abnormality of the penis, in which there is incomplete development of the distal urethra. There are numerous reports showing an increase of prevalence of hypospadias. Association of craniofacial malformations in patients diagnosed with hypospadias is rare. The aim of this study is to describe the association between hypospadias and craniofacial congenital anomalies. Materials and Methods: A retrospective review of the Latin-American collaborative study of congenital malformations (ECLAMC) data was performed between January 1982 and December 2011. We included children diagnosed with associated hypospadias and among them we selected those that were associated with any craniofacial congenital anomaly. Results: Global prevalence was 11.3 per 10.000 newborns. In this population a total of 809 patients with 1117 associated anomalies were identified. On average there were 1.7 anomalies per patient. Facial anomalies were present in 13.2%. The most commonly major facial anomaly associated to hypospadias was cleft lip/palate with 52 cases. We identified that 18% have an association with other anomalies, and found an association between craniofacial anomalies and hypospadias in 0.59 cases/10.000 newborns. Discussion: Hypospadias is the most common congenital anomaly affecting the genitals. Its association with other anomalies is rare. It has been reported that other malformations occur in 29.3% of the cases with hypospadias. The more proximal the meatus, the higher the risk for having another associated anomaly. Conclusion: Associated hypospadias are rare, and it is important to identify the concurrent occurrence of craniofacial anomalies to better treat patients that might need a multidisciplinary approach.",Article,"Fernandez, N.; Escobar, R.; Zarante, I.",Hypospadias; Craniofacial Abnormalities; South America; Population Groups,Hypospadias;Craniofacial Abnormalities;South America;Population Groups;HYPERTELORISM;PREVALENCE;REPAIR,Colombia,2-s2.0-84991088866

High incidence of sleep-related breathing disorders in children with down syndrome referred to a high-altitude sleep laboratory. High Alt Med Biol. 00:000-000, 2019. Aims: The aim of the study was to assess the incidence of sleep-related breathing disorders (SRBD) in children with Down Syndrome (DS) living at high altitude. Methods: A retrospective descriptive study was conducted on 53 children with DS who underwent polysomnography (PSG) at San Ignacio University Hospital (2640 m/8660 ft above sea level) from 2009 to 2016. Data were extracted from official PSG reports and analyzed using measures of central tendency and dispersion, frequency calculation, ranges, and confidence intervals. Associations were examined using t-test, chi-square test, and analysis of variance test. Results: Obstructive sleep apnea (OSA) was present in 90.5% of children. Central sleep apnea was evident in 11.3%. Periodic breathing was seen in 15.1% of patients. Snoring was able to predict OSA with a sensitivity of 61.7%, a specificity of 100%, and negative predictive value of 25%. Conclusion: Children with DS who live at high altitude have a high incidence of SRBD. Our findings show a higher incidence of SRBD than previously reported in the population with DS. Furthermore, snoring was not sensitive enough to predict OSA. This high risk of SRBD may increase the risk of other comorbid conditions seen in the population with DS.

Non-typhoid Salmonella in meat and meat products as model (systematic review),"Background The scientific publications of antimicrobial susceptibilities and resistance must be precise, with interpretations adjusted to the standard. In this frame, knowledge of antimicrobial resistance is fundamental in pathogenic microorganisms such as Salmonella spp., known for many annual deaths worldwide. The objective of this work was to compare the interpretation of standards, the concentrations, and the breakpoints, to study antimicrobial resistance in Non-Typhoidal Salmonella (NTS) isolated from beef, pork, and chicken meat, meat products, and propose additional considerations that improve the use and usefulness of published results. Results After refining the search based on meeting the inclusion and exclusion criteria, 48 papers were selected. In 33 (68.8%) of them, the disc diffusion method was used, in 11 (22.9%) the MIC determination method, and in 4 (8.33%) were used both. In 24 (50%) of the articles, the selection of a different (correct) standard could have had an impact on the interpretation of antimicrobial susceptibility, which observed when considering three scenarios, i) comparison between the year of the isolation versus the implemented standard, ii) comparison between the year of submission versus implemented standard and iii) comparison between the year of publication versus implemented standard. Conclusions The most frequent scenario was the inadequate selection of standards, indicating that some studies had not ensured that applied standards kept in line with the date of isolation, date of publication and interpretation of susceptibilities. We proposed 2 years for standards use for resistance and multi-resistance interpretations. On the other hand, we invite researchers to publish their results in the shortest possible time, and editors and reviewers of scientific journals to prioritise these types of studies and verify the correspondence between the standard cited and the one used and the one to be taken into account.",Review,"Rincon-Gamboa, S.M.; Poutou-Pinales, R.A.; Carrascal-Camacho, A.K.",Multidrug resistance; Meat products; Standard; Non-typhoidal Salmonella,Multidrug resistance;Meat products;Standard;Non-typhoidal Salmonella;RETAIL CHICKEN MEAT;ANTIBIOTIC-RESISTANCE;GENETIC-CHARACTERIZATION;EXTENDED-SPECTRUM;MOLECULAR CHARACTERIZATION;TURKEY MEAT;PREVALENCE;ENTERICA;SEROVARS;POULTRY,Colombia,2-s2.0-85111749301;2-s2.0-85111749301

Results: Ten studies fulfilling the inclusion criteria were included in the review (two longitudinal studies with 1-year follow-up comparing the success of primary root canal treatment between type 2 diabetic patients and non-diabetic patients, and eight cross-sectional studies). Analysis of the ten studies showed that inadequate control of type 2 DM may predispose and influence the inflammatory pulpal and periapical disease evolution. Conclusions: The present systematic review suggests that there are biologic bases to suggest that type 2 DM may act as a risk factor for developing an endodontic pathology, affecting the course of the disease in terms of susceptibility, prevalence, progression, and tissue healing capacity as a consequence of a disrupted immune response.

In Colombia, its prevalence is 25% with a high mortality rate. The psychosocial factors affecting pharmacological adherence among patients have not been sufficiently studied and despite international evidence on their impact, in Colombia, there is a paucity of research on the role of chronic stress in the relationship between socioeconomic status and pharmacological adherence. Objective: To examine the role of chronic stress in the relationship between socioeconomic status and pharmacological adherence in hypertensive patients aged 45 to 70 years old in three Colombian cities between 2015 and 2016. Materials and methods: We conducted a cross-sectional study in a population of hypertensive patients. Data for this study came from the first wave of longitudinal study aimed at examining social factors associated with the control of hypertension in Bogota, Medellin, and Quibdo. Patients with hypertension were selected randomly from a sample of those participating in the hypertension control program De todo corazon. For the statistical analysis of the data, we used factorial analysis and multivariate regressions. Results: We found a positive association between socioeconomic status and the degree of pharmacological adherence and a negative one with chronic stress. Besides, evidence was found that stress has a negative association with the degree of adherence. Conclusions: The results suggest that stress is not a likely mediator between socioeconomic status and the pharmacological adherence of hypertensive patients in Colombia.

This paper describes a cohort of Colombian subjects treated with direct-acting antiviral agents. A total of 195 patients from 5 hepatology centers in 4 Colombian cities were retrospectively studied. For each patient, serum biomarkers were obtained, and Child-Pugh, MELD, cirrhosis and fibrosis stage were calculated. Additionally, viral load was quantified at initiation, end of treatment and at 12 weeks of completion. Adverse effects were recorded.

,,,2,WOS:000808512500001,2022,Historical overview and update on relapsing fever group Borrelia in Latin America,"Relapsing fever group Borrelia (RFGB) are motile spirochetes transmitted to mammalian or avian hosts through the bite of hematophagous arthropods, such as soft ticks (Argasidae), hard ticks (Ixodidae) and the human clothing lice. RFGB can infect pets such as dogs and cats, as well as birds, cattle and humans. Borrelia recurrentis, B. anserina and B. theileri are considered to have worldwide distribution, affecting humans, domestic birds and ruminants, respectively. Borrelia spp. associated with soft ticks are transmitted mainly by Ornithodoros ticks and thrive in endemic foci in tropical and subtropical latitudes. Nowadays, human cases of soft tick-borne relapsing fever remain neglected diseases in several countries, and the impact these spirochetes have on the health of wild and domestic animals is largely understudied. Human infection with RFGB is difficult to diagnose, given the lack of distinguishing clinical features (undifferentiated febrile illness). Clinically, soft tick or louse-borne relapsing fever is often confused with other etiologies, such as malaria, typhoid or dengue. In Latin America, during the first half of the twentieth century historical documents elaborated by enlightened physicians were seminal, and resulted in the identification of RFGB and their associated vectors in countries such as Mexico, Panama, Colombia, Venezuela, Peru and Argentina. Almost 80 years later, research on relapsing fever spirochetes is emerging once again in Latin America, with molecular characterizations and isolations of novel RFGB members in Panama, Bolivia, Brazil and Chile. In this review we summarize historical aspects of RFGB in Latin America and provide an update on the current scenario regarding these pathogens in the region. To accomplish this, we conducted an exhaustive search of all the published literature for the region, including old medical theses deposited in libraries of medical academies. RFGB were once common pathogens in Latin America, and although unnoticed for many years, they are currently the focus of interest among the scientific community. A One Health perspective should be adopted to tackle the diseases caused by RFGB, since these spirochetes have never disappeared and the maladies they cause may be confused with etiologies with similar symptoms that prevail in the region.",Review,"Faccini-Martinez, A.A.; Silva-Ramos, C.R.; Santodomingo, A.M.; Ramirez-Hernandez, A.; Costa, F.B.; Labruna, M.B.; Munoz-Leal, S.",Soft ticks; Ornithodoros; Spirochetes; Tick-borne diseases; Relapsing fever; Borrelia; Clothing lice; Latin America,Soft ticks;Ornithodoros;Spirochetes;Tick-borne diseases;Relapsing fever;Borrelia;Clothing lice;Latin America;ACARI ARGASIDAE;PUERTORICENSIS FOX;TICK;SPIROCHETE;BURGDORFERI;THEILERI;IXODIDA;NEOTROPICALIS;TRANSMISSION;PREVALENCE,Colombia;Chile;Brazil,2-s2.0-85131642911;2-s2.0-85131642911

Low vitamin E intake during early pregnancy associates with congenital malformations and embryonic loss in animals and with miscarriage and intrauterine growth restriction in humans. Vitamin E protects cell membranes from lipoperoxidation and exerts non-antioxidant activities. Its function can be restored by vitamin C; thus, intake and circulating levels of both micronutrients are frequently analyzed together. Although substantial vitamin E inadequacy was reported worldwide, its consumption in Latin America (LatAm) is mostly unknown. Using data from the Latin American Study of Nutrition and Health (Estudio Latinoamericano de Nutricion y Salud, ELANS), we evaluated vitamin E and C intake in women of reproductive age (WRA) from eight LatAm countries and identified their main food sources. Two non-consecutive 24-h dietary recalls in 3704 women aged from 15 to 49 years and living in urban locations showed low average intake of vitamin E (7.9 mg/day vs. estimated average requirement (EAR) of 12 mg/day) and adequate overall vitamin C consumption (95.5 mg/day vs. EAR of 60 mg/day). The mean regional inadequacy was 89.6% for vitamin E and 36.3% for vitamin C. The primary food sources of vitamin E were fats and oils, as well as vegetables. Vitamin C intake was explained mainly by the consumption of fruit juices, fruits, and vegetables. Combined deficient intake of both vitamins was observed in 33.7% of LatAm women.

Method: We used data from three upper middle-income settings (Colombia-SABE-Bogota, Mexico-SAGE, and South Africa-SAGE) and two high-income countries (England-ELSA and US-HRS) to estimate logistic regression models using age, gender, and education to predict health and health behaviors. Results: The sharpest gradients appear in middle-income settings but follow expected patterns found in high-income countries for poor self-reported health, functionality, cognitive impairment, and depression. However, weaker gradients appear for obesity, hypertension, diabetes, and other chronic conditions in Colombia and Mexico and the gradient reverses in South Africa. Strong disparities exist in risky health behaviors and in early nutritional status in the middle-income settings. Discussion: Rapid demographic and nutritional transitions, urbanization, poor early life conditions, social mobility, negative health behavior, and unique country circumstances provide a useful framework for understanding the SES health gradient in middle-income settings.

In the visual screening, visual acuity, ocular alignment and the presence of structural ocular anomalies should be assessed. Methods: A literature review about strategies to perform an adequate pediatric visual examination by general physicians and pediatricians for early detection of visual problems in children was carried out. Results: Visual disorders are one of the main causes of disability in children, being the main risk factors uncorrected refractive errors, strabismus and congenital cataracts, that can leave irreversible sequels if they are not detected on time, being those disorders identified through visual screening.

Thus, 20% adults will develop metabolic syndrome (MS) along their lifespan within a tremendous effect their lives. Objective: To identify social, biological and behavioral factors associated with MS in adults. Materials and methods: 300 cases, 675 controls were included. Cases had waist circumference (abdominal obesity) >= 94cm/men and >= 88cm/women, plus other two factors including hypertension, high glycated hemoglobin, high triglycerides, and low HDL levels. Controls presented one or none one of previously cited risk factors. Results: Whole MS prevalence was 30.2%, being in females 33.6%, and 25.6% in males. Therefore, females had a higher risk for developing MS, OR = 1.70 95%CI (1.17-2.47). Ethnicity ""mestizo"" also increased the risk of having MS, OR =1.55 (1.10-2.19). In contrast, frequent fruit consumption and being housekeeper were protective factors, OR 0.83 (0.69 - 1.00), OR 0.58 (0.36-0.92), respectively. Logistic regression showed that obesity is the strongest associated MS risk factor, OR = 7.52 (4.79-11.80). Increasing age yield alinear trend with SM. Thus, age range from 40 to 49 years old, yield OR = 4.24 (2.20-8.16), 50 to 59 years old, OR = 4.63 (2.40-8.93) and those older than 80 years, OR = 5.32(1.92-14.71).

Methods: A cross-sectional study was conducted among 1742 people with type 2 diabetes attending diabetes clinics in London, Ontario, Canada, and Bogota, Colombia. The data were extracted from the Global Registry and Surveillance System for Diabetes (GRAND). Results: Canadian patients were diagnosed with diabetes at significantly younger ages than Colombian patients (49 years and 53 years, respectively) and were heavier (body mass indices of 33 and 28, respectively). The Colombian patient population had significantly higher mean glycated hemoglobin (A1C) levels (9.4% vs. 8.6%) and fewer patients (22% vs. 26%) at the glycemic target (A1C <7.0%) than Canadian patients. In Colombia, 1 or more diabetes-related complications were present in 51% of the study population compared with 37% in Canada. Newly diagnosed Colombians had higher mean A1C levels (9.1% vs. 8.7%) and low-density lipoprotein-C levels (3.3 mmol/L vs. 2.5 mmol/L) than did newly diagnosed Canadians.

,,,1,WOS:000697552100001,2021,Analysis of Heritability Across the Clinical Phenotypes of Frontotemporal Dementia and the Frequency of the C9ORF72 in a Colombian Population,"Frontotemporal dementia (FTD) is a highly heritable condition. Up to 40% of FTD is familial and an estimated 15% to 40% is due to single-gene mutations. It has been estimated that the G4C2 hexanucleotide repeat expansions in the C9ORF72 gene can explain up to 37.5% of the familial cases of FTD, especially in populations of Caucasian origin. The purpose of this paper is to evaluate hereditary risk across the clinical phenotypes of FTD and the frequency of the G4C2 expansion in a Colombian cohort diagnosed with FTD.</p> Methods: A total of 132 FTD patients were diagnosed according to established criteria in the behavioral variant FTD, logopenic variant PPA, non-fluent agrammatic PPA, and semantic variant PPA. Hereditary risk across the clinical phenotypes was established in four categories that indicate the pathogenic relationship of the mutation: high, medium, low, and apparently sporadic, based on those proposed by Wood and collaborators. All subjects were also examined for C9ORF72 hexanucleotide expansion (defined as >30 repetitions).</p> Results: There were no significant differences in the demographic characteristics of the patients between the clinical phenotypes of FTD. The higher rate phenotype was bvFTD (62.12%). In accordance with the risk classification, we found that 72 (54.4%) complied with the criteria for the sporadic cases; for the familial cases, 23 (17.4%) fulfilled the high-risk criteria, 23 (17.4%) fulfilled the low risk criteria, and 14 (10.6%) fulfilled the criteria to be classified as subject to medium risk. C9ORF72 expansion frequency was 0.76% (1/132).</p> Conclusion: The FTD heritability presented in this research was very similar to the results reported in the literature. The C9ORF72 expansion frequency was low. Colombia is a triethnic country, with a high frequency of genetic Amerindian markers; this shows consistency with the present results of a low repetition frequency. This study provides an initial report of the frequency for the hexanucleotide repeat expansions in C9ORF72 in patients with FTD in a Colombian population and paves the way for further study of the possible genetic causes of FTD in Colombia.</p>",Article,"Lopez-Caceres, A.; Velasco-Rueda, M.; Garcia-Cifuentes, E.; Zarante, I.; Matallana, D.",C9ORF72; frontotemporal dementia; Colombia; family inheritance; heritability,C9ORF72;frontotemporal dementia;Colombia;family inheritance;heritability;HEXANUCLEOTIDE REPEAT EXPANSION;LOBAR DEGENERATION;PREVALENCE;GENETICS;CRITERIA;SUBTYPES;NUMBER;FTD;ALS,Colombia,2-s2.0-85114830437;2-s2.0-85114830437;2-s2.0-85114830437;2-s2.0-85114830437

The primary objective was to describe the frequency of dyslipidaemias. The secondary objectives were: frequency of cardiovascular comorbidity, statins and other lipid lowering drugs use, frequency of statins intolerance, percentage of patients achieving c-LDL goals, and distribution of cardiovascular risk (CVR). Materials and methods: Cross-sectional study with retrospective data collection from 461 patients diagnosed with dyslipidaemia and treated in 17 highly specialised centres distributed into six geographic and economic regions of Colombia. Results: Mean (SD) age was 66.4 ( 12.3) years and 53.4% (246) were women. Dyslipidaemias were distributed as follows in order of frequency: mixed dystipidaemia (51.4%), hypercholesterolaemia (41.0%), hypertriglyceridaemia (5.4%), familial hypercholesterolaemia (3.3%), and low c-HDL (0.7%). The most prescribed drugs were atorvastatin (75.7%) followed by rosuvastatin (24.9%). As for lipid control, 55% of all patients, and 28.6% of those with coronary heart disease, did not achieve their personal c-LDL goal despite treatment. The frequency of statin intolerance was 2.6% in this study. Conclusions: Mixed dyslipidaemia and hypercholesterolaemia are the most frequent dyslipidaemias in Colombia. A notable percentage of patients under treatment with lipid -lowering drugs, including those with coronary heart disease, did not achieve specific c-LDL goals. This poor lipid control may worsen patient's CVR, so that therapeutic strategies need to be changed, either with statin intensification or addition of new drugs in patients with higher CVR. 2020 Sociedad Espanola de Arteriosclerosis.

A cross-sectional study was carried out, in which 1057 Colombian university students participated. The instruments applied were the Cuestionario Confidencial Vida Sexual Activa (CCVSA, for its Spanish acronym), the tests Barreras Hacia la Prueba del VIH, Escala de Actitudes hacia el VIH-Sida and an ad hoc questionnaire on knowledge about the test. The students who were tested (n = 214) reported a lower age of sexual initiation (p < .01), a higher number of sexual partners (p = .01), and a lower use of condoms in the first (p = .02) and last (p = .04) sexual intercourse. They also reported more knowledge about HIV testing (p < .001). The main barriers were associated with low risk perception of the disease (29.8 %), trust in sexual partners (29.2 %), and lack of offer of the test (25.2 %).

To test this hypothesis, samples were obtained from five abattoirs, which represent 50% of the beef production in this country. A total of 1017 samples were collected, from which 606 were bovine feces, 206 were hide swabs, and 205 corresponded to carcass post-intervention. From the 1017 samples, 49.9% (n = 507) were collected during dry season, while 50.1% (n = 510) during rainy season. All samples (n = 1017) underwent screening for E. coli O157:H7 and Salmonella, while only a proportion of fecal samples (n = 339) were screened for the big six STEC serogroups and their virulence markers. The effect of season, age of animal and sex of animal were correlated with the prevalence results. A total of 84.7% of fecal samples carried virulence genes associated to STEC (stx or eae), suggesting that testing and control should be increased for the big-six STEC compared to E. coli O157:H7. Pathogen prevalence in feces was found to be 8.3%, 5.0%, and 51.0% for Salmonella, E. coli O157:H7 and STEC non-O157, respectively.

Human cysticercosis poses a substantial public health burden in endemic countries. The World Health Organization (WHO) aims to target high-endemicity settings with enhanced interventions in 17 countries by 2030. Between 2008 and 2010, Colombia undertook a national baseline serosurvey of unprecedented scale, which led to an estimated seroprevalence of T. solium cysticercus antibodies among the general population of 8.6%. Here, we use contemporary geostatistical approaches to analyse this unique dataset with the aim of understanding the spatial distribution and risk factors associated with human cysticercosis in Colombia to inform how best to target intervention strategies. Methods: We used a geostatistical model to estimate individual and household risk factors associated with seropositivity to T. solium cysticercus antibodies from 29,253 people from 133 municipalities in Colombia. We used both independent and spatially structured random effects at neighbourhood/village and municipality levels to account for potential clustering of exposure to T. solium. We present estimates of the distribution and residual correlation of seropositivity at the municipality level. Results: High seroprevalence was identified in municipalities located in the north and south of Colombia, with spatial correlation in seropositivity estimated up to approximately 140 km. Statistically significant risk factors associated with seropositivity to T. solium cysticercus were related to age, sex, educational level, socioeconomic status, use of rainwater, consumption of partially cooked/raw pork meat and possession of dogs. Conclusions: In Colombia, the distribution of human cysticercosis is influenced by socioeconomic considerations, education and environmental factors related to the spread of T. solium eggs. This information can be used to tailor national intervention strategies, such as targeting spatial hotspots and more highly exposed groups, including displaced people and women.

Clinical features and impact on health","Background During a health survey in a remote area in southwest Colombia, it became apparent that a high percentage of the population suffered from chronic pruritus in association with high numbers of ticks and tickbites. Objective To determine the clinical features and severity of tickbite-associated pruritus. Method At twotime points - 8 weeks apart to account for seasonal effects - a cross-sectional study was conducted encompassing physical examination of the population, histological analysis of skin biopsies, and determining serum for antibodies against spotted fever (SFG) rickettsiae and typhus group (TG) rickettsiae. Ticks were identified using morphological criteria, and infection by rickettsiae was determined by PCR. Results About 94.5% of the population (95% CI 92-97%) showed clinical signs of a pruritic arthropod reaction and of chronic pruritus with lichenoid papules and hyper- and hypopigmented nodules on otherwise noninflamed skin. Pruritus markedly impaired the quality of life in terms of sleeping disturbances. No signs for other diseases were observed. Chronic pruritus appeared to be because of repeated tickbites and scratching, but not because of other dermatological or medical conditions. Antibodies against SFG and TG-rickettsiae were detected at 79.0% (95% CI 73-86) and 3.6% (95% CI 0.7-6), respectively. Ticks were identified asAmblyomma cajennense. Conclusion Remarkably high exposure to tick bites caused an unusually high rate of acute and chronic pruritus and markedly impaired quality of life of the investigated rural community.

Colombian Association of Rheumatology","Background: Axial Spondyloarthritis is a rheumatic condition affecting young patients with social and occupational consequences. Diagnosis delay is associated with functional impairment and impact on quality of life, requiring a multidisciplinary approach. Objective: To develop a set of recommendations based on the best available evidence for early detection, diagnosis, treatment and monitoring adult patients with axial spondyloarthritis. Methods: A working group was established, questions were developed, outcomes were graded, and a systematic search for evidence was conducted. A multidisciplinary panel of members was established (including patient representatives), minimizing bias in relation to conflicts of interest. The GRADE approach ""Grading of Recommendations Assessment, Development and Evaluation"" was used to assess the quality of the evidence as well as the direction and strength of recommendations. In total, 11 recommendations with regard to diagnosis (n = 2), pharmacological treatment (n = 6), non-pharmacological treatment (n = 2) and monitoring (n = 1) are presented. Results: Sacroiliac joint radiography as the first diagnostic method, and the use of disease activity scales for patient monitoring (ASDAS or BASDAI), are recommended. Nonsteroidal anti-inflammatory drugs are the first treatment option; in case of intolerance or residual pain, acetaminophen or opioids are recommended. In patients with axial involvement, it is recommended not to use conventional disease-modifying antirheumatic drugs or systemic or local glucocorticoids. In patients with failure to non-steroidal anti-inflammatory drugs, anti-TNF or anti-IL17A is recommended. In those patients presenting with anti-TNF failure, starting an anti-IL17A is recommended. Exercise, physical and occupational therapy are recommended as part of treatment. It is recommended not to use unconventional therapies as the only treatment option. Conclusions: This set of recommendations provides an updated guide on the diagnosis, treatment and monitoring of patients with axial spondyloarthritis.(c) 2021 Elsevier Espan tilde a, S.L.U. and Sociedad Espan tilde ola de Reumatologi acute accent a y Colegio Mexicano de Reumatologi acute accent a.

This study aimed to characterize alcohol consumers at the nutritional, anthropometric, and sociodemographic levels. Data from 9218 participants from Argentina, Brazil, Chile, Colombia, Costa Rica, Ecuador, Peru, and Venezuela participating in ""Latin American Health and Nutrition Study (ELANS)"", a multi-country, population-based study, were used. Dietary intake was collected through two, 24 h recalls. Participants were classified into consumers (n = 1073) and non-alcohol consumers (n = 8145) using a cut-off criterium of >= 15 g/day of alcohol consumption calculated from the estimation of their usual daily intake. Among alcohol consumers, the mean alcohol consumption was 69.22 +/- 2.18 grams (4.6. beverages/day), contributing to 484.62 kcal, which corresponded to 16.86% of the total energy intake. We found that the risk of alcohol consumption was higher in young and middle-aged men from low and middle socioeconomic status. Argentine, Brazil, and Chile had the highest percentage of consumers, while Ecuador showed the highest alcohol consumption. Alcohol drinkers were characterized by having higher body weight and wider neck, waist, hips circumferences. Alcohol drinkers had a higher energy intake, with macronutrients providing relatively less energy at the expense of the energy derived from alcohol. Alcohol drinkers showed lower and higher consumptions of healthy and unhealthy food groups, respectively. In addition, adequacy ratios for all micronutrients assessed were lower in alcohol consumers. All these deleterious effects of alcohol on nutritional and anthropometric parameters increased with the number of alcoholic beverages consumed daily.

The aim of the present study was to analyze the early neonatal case fatality rate (CFR) and total birth prevalence of newborns diagnosed with CH. Methods Data were provided by 25 registries from four continents participating in the International Clearinghouse for Birth Defects Surveillance and Research (ICBDSR) on births ascertained between 2000 and 2014. Two CH rates were calculated using a Poisson distribution: early neonatal CFR (death within 7 days) per 100 liveborn CH cases (CFR) and total birth prevalence rate (BPR) per 10,000 births (including live births and stillbirths) (BPR). Heterogeneity between registries was calculated using a meta-analysis approach with random effects. Temporal trends in CFR and BPR within registries were evaluated through Poisson regression modeling. Results A total of 13,112 CH cases among 19,293,280 total births were analyzed. The early neonatal CFR was 5.9 per 100 liveborn cases, 95% confidence interval (CI): 5.4-6.8. The CFR among syndromic cases was 2.7 times (95% CI: 2.2-3.3) higher than among non-syndromic cases (10.4% [95% CI: 9.3-11.7] and 4.4% [95% CI: 3.7-5.2], respectively). The total BPR was 6.8 per 10,000 births (95% CI: 6.7-6.9). Stratified by elective termination of pregnancy for fetal anomalies (ETOPFA), region and system, higher CFR were observed alongside higher BPR rates. The early neonatal CFR and total BPR did not show temporal variation, with the exception of a CFR decrease in one registry. Conclusions Findings of early neonatal CFR and total BPR were highly heterogeneous among registries participating in ICBDSR. Most registries with higher CFR also had higher BPR. Differences were attributable to type of registry (hospital-based vs. population-based), ETOPFA (allowed yes or no) and geographical regions.

Aim: To determine the prevalence of FSD/ED and its association with LUTS in Colombia. Methods: Sub-analysis of a cross-sectional, population-based study conducted in subjects >= 18 years old to evaluate LUTS/OAB. The estimated sample size was 1,054. ED was defined as <= 21 points in the SHIM and FSD as <= 19 in the FSFI-6. For LUTS/OAB, we used the 2002 ICS and 2010 IUGA/ICS definitions and validated questionnaires. Descriptive and inferential statistics were employed. Outcomes: Prevalence of FSD/ED and association of FSD/ED and LUTS. Results: We included 1,060 participants; the median age was 40 (IQR 27-54) years. Fifty-seven (11.4%) men and 182 (32.7%) women were sexually inactive. The prevalence of FSD/ED in sexually active participants was 47% (men 52.9%, women 38.9%). The most common FSD/ED symptoms were diminished/absent lubrication in women (42%) and diminished erection maintenance after penetration in men (13%). Individuals with FSD/ED had higher rates of various LUTS. The multivariable logistic regression model found that the city of residence (OR = 0.4, 95% CI 0.2-0.9), diabetes mellitus (DM) (OR = 8.4, 95% CI 1.4-48.7), menopause (OR=3.5, 95% CI 1.9-6.2), urge urinary incontinence (UUI) (OR=1.9, 95% CI 1.1-3.3) and nocturia >= 2 (OR = 2.2, 95% CI 1.2-4.2) were associated with FSD. In men, age 40-59 (OR = 2.3, 95% CI 1.4-3.7) and >= 60 (OR = 5.5, 95% CI 2.4-12.5), the city of residence (OR = 0.2, 95% CI 0.1-0.3), less than a high-school diploma vs higher education (OR = 2.0, 95% CI 1.2-3.2), depression (OR = 4.6, 95% CI 1.8-11.5), UUI (OR = 3.2, 95% CI 1.1 -10.2) and feeling of incomplete bladder emptying (OR = 2.1, 95% CI 1.3-3.5) were associated with ED. Clinical Implications: This study underlines the importance of assessing LUTS in women and men of all affected age groups who present with symptoms of FSD/ED and vice versa, which could help achieve a better approach for these patients. Strengths & Limitations: This is the first study in Colombia and one of the few in Latin America that addresses both FSD/ED and LUTS in men and women aged 18 years and older. Limitations include being a sub-analysis of a study aiming to determine the prevalence of LUTS/OAB and not FSD/ED. Conclusions: Regardless of age, LUTS were observed more frequently in patients with FSD/ED. Various LUTS were associated with FSD/ED. Copyright (C) 2021, International Society of Sexual Medicine.

Even as the amygdala undergoes significant atrophy in mild dementia, amygdala volume is underexplored as a risk factor for neuropsychiatric symptoms (NPS). Objective: To analyze the association between baseline amygdala volume and the longitudinal trajectories of NPS and cognitive decline in Alzheimer's disease (AD) and dementia with Lewy bodies (DLB) over 5 years. Methods: Eighty-nine patients with mild dementia were included (AD = 55; DLB = 34). Amygdala volume was segmented from structural magnetic resonance images (sMRI) using a semi-automatic method (Freesurfer 6.0) and normalized by intracranial volumes. The intracranial volume-normalized amygdala was used as a predictor of the Neuropsychiatric Inventory (NPI) total score, ordinal NPI item scores (0 = absence of symptoms, 1-3 = mild symptoms, >= 4 = clinically relevant symptoms), and Mini-Mental State Examination (MMSE) as measured annually over 5 years using gamma, ordinal, and linear mixed-effects models, respectively. The models were adjusted for demographic variables, diagnosis, center of sMRI acquisition, and cognitive performance. Multiple testing-corrected p-values (q-values) are reported. Results: Larger intracranial volume-normalized amygdala was associated with less agitation/aggression (odds ratio (OR) = 0.62 [0.43, 0.90], p = 0.011, q = 0.038) and less MMSE decline per year (fixed effect = 0.70, [0.29, 1.03], p = 0.001, q = 0.010) but more depression (OR = 1.49 [1.09, 2.04], p = 0.013, q = 0.040).

The aim of this article was to report our experience with the complete study for erectile dysfunction, including intracavernous injection rigidity test, biothesiometry and colour duplex Doppler ultrasound. Data were collected and analysed prospectively. The primary end point was to determine whether treatment decision-making was eased by the CompED test. Secondary end points were to establish which clinical variables prior to the study could impact the results of the CompED test, to finally improve patient selection for the study. 187 patients were recruited, 31.2% of the patients had an axial rigidity below 50%, 28.5% had a peak systolic velocity <25 cm/s, 13.2% had an end-diastolic velocity >5cm/s and 27.5% had an abnormal biothesiometry. The factors that best predicted an abnormal result in any of the tests were age >70 years, IIEF domain A < 14 points, and previous radical prostatectomy or radiotherapy.

It is characterized by involvement in the nerves that produce a pain like rush, burn or stitch. This neuropathic pain has been associated with a high risk of anxiety in patients with it, thus generating a more significant economic burden in patients with symptomatic diabetic neuropathy. Aim: To describe current literature on the relationship between symptomatic diabetic Neuropathy and the risk of concomitant anxiety symptoms. Method: We carried out a similar search by four reviewers in the Ovid, Pubmed, SciELO, and Cochrane databases. Results: Of the 1140 articles found, 56 were evaluated in full text. A varied prevalence of anxious and depressive symptoms was found in patients with symptomatic diabetic neuropathy, evaluated using different questionnaires and scales. Some studies found an association between anxiety symptoms, sleep disorders, and inadequate glycemic control. Early education and the management of neuropathic pain have been reported as factors of good prognosis, the latter being the determinants of quality of life and productivity in patients with symptomatic diabetic neuropathy. Conclusion: The relationship between diabetic neuropathy and anxiety symptoms can be bidirectional. Given these findings and their possible impact on the individual and public health, opportunities arise to fill the gaps in primary prevention, early diagnosis, and treatment in this population, which should be defined in future research.",Article,"Botero-Rodriguez, F.; Cruz-Ramirez, V.; Cote, D.; Cespedes, K.; Smith-Velasco, S.; Gomez-Restrepo, C.",diabetic neuropathy; diabetes mellitus; anxiety; public health,diabetic neuropathy;diabetes mellitus;anxiety;public health;HEALTH-CARE COSTS;DEPRESSION;PAIN;ANTIDEPRESSANT;PREVALENCE;DISORDERS;PATTERNS;MODEL,Colombia,

Materials and methods Searches for randomized clinical trials were performed in PubMed, Embase, Scopus, Cochrane (CENTRAL), and Web of Science. Two independent researchers performed study selection, data extraction, and risk-of-bias assessment; a third one resolved any disagreement. Meta-analysis was not feasible, and a narrative approach was used to synthesize the evidence. Results Seven studies were included. Dental floss with chlorhexidine was used in five studies, whereas interdental brushes with chlorhexidine and cetylpyridinium chloride were used in one study each. ICDs with active substances resulted in significantly higher antiplaque and antigingivitis efficacies than without ICDs (n = 3). ICDs with and without active substances demonstrated contrasting results. For this comparison, six studies were included for each outcome. Significantly higher antigingivitis efficacy of ICDs with active substances was noted in four studies, whereas significantly higher antiplaque efficacy of ICDs with active substances was reported in three studies.

This, in addition to metabolic effects, makes it difficult to assess the real state of individual energy balance. This study aims to analyze the energy gaps between intake and expenditure in the adult population of Latin America, as well as its relationships with sociodemographic variables and nutrition status, to draw an epidemiological perspective based on the trends observed. The energy imbalance gap was used to this end. The difference between energy intake and expenditure can be applied as a reference to explain whether weight equilibrium can prevent weight gain. Moreover, the energy imbalance gap allows for a better understanding of the design of public health policies. Using data from the Latin American Study of Nutrition and Health, the energy imbalance gap in adult population from eight Latin-American countries was assessed in 5994 subjects aged from 19-65. Usual dietary intake was measured using two non-consecutive 24 h dietary recalls. The sociodemographic questionnaire was supplemented by anthropometric measurements. Physical activity was measured through the long International Physical Activity Questionnaire. Energy expenditure was obtained using the basal metabolic rate. For the overall sample, the mean energy intake was 1939.1 kcal (95% CI: 1926.9; 1951.3), the mean of energy expenditure was 1915.7 kcal (95% CI: 1906.4; 1924.9), and the mean of energy imbalance gap was 23.4 kcal (95% CI: 11.9; 35.0). Results show that energy intake and expenditure were higher in men. Moreover, subjects aged 19-34, of high socioeconomic level, who completed high school, were mestizos and were of normal weight consumed the highest number of calories. Overall, a positive energy imbalance gap was observed. Overweight and obese from Argentina, Costa Rica, Ecuador, Peru, and Venezuela showed a significantly lower energy imbalance gap than underweight subjects.

Hence, we evaluated the vector competence of A. patinoi with R. rickettsii under laboratory conditions. Experimental guinea pigs and rabbits (males and females) were separated in the infected group (IG) and the control group (CG). In the IG, the filial 1 (F1) larvae (R. rickettsii-free) from Colombian A. patinoi engorged female specimens were exposed to R. rickettsii (ITU strain) by feeding on infected guinea pigs. Next, F1 nymphs and adults, and F2 larvae were allowed to feed on uninfected guinea pigs or rabbits and tested by qPCR targeting the gltA rickettsial gene. All animals used to feed the IG F1 ticks became febrile and had R. rickettsii infection (89% fatality rate) detected through serological or molecular techniques. After the F1 larvae ticks became R. rickettsii infected, subsequent IG tick stages were able to maintain the rickettsial infection by transstadial maintenance to all infested animals, indicating A. patinoi vector competence. Subsequently, almost 31% of the F1 female egg masses and only 42% of their F2 larvae were infected. Less than 50% of the infected females transmitted R. rickettsii transovarially, and only a part of the offspring were infected. This study demonstrated that A. patinoi might not be able to sustain R. rickettsii infection by transovarial transmission for successive tick generations without horizontal transmission via rickettsemic hosts.

This study aimed to prospectively investigate the distribution of musculoskeletal pain anatomically, and explore risk factors for increases/reductions in the number of painful sites. Methods Using data from participants working in 45 occupational groups in 18 countries, we explored changes in reporting pain at 10 anatomical sites on two occasions 14 months apart. We used descriptive statistics to explore consistency over time in the number of painful sites, and their anatomical distribution. Baseline risk factors for increases/reductions by >= 3 painful sites were explored by random intercept logistic regression that adjusted for baseline number of painful sites. Results Among 8927 workers, only 20% reported no pain at either time point, and 16% reported >= 3 painful sites both times. After 14 months, the anatomical distribution of pain often changed but there was only an average increase of 0.17 painful sites. Some 14% workers reported a change in painful sites by >= 3. Risk factors for an increase of >= 3 painful sites included female sex, lower educational attainment, having a physically demanding job and adverse beliefs about the work-relatedness of musculoskeletal pain. Also predictives were as follows: older age, somatizing tendency and poorer mental health (each of which was also associated with lower odds of reductions of >= 3 painful sites). Conclusions Longitudinally, the number of reported painful sites was relatively stable but the anatomical distribution varied considerably. These findings suggest an important role for central pain sensitization mechanisms, rather than localized risk factors, among working adults. Significance Our findings indicate that within individuals, the number of painful sites is fairly constant over time, but the anatomical distribution varies, supporting the theory that among people at work, musculoskeletal pain is driven more by factors that predispose to experiencing or reporting pain rather than by localized stressors specific to only one or two anatomical sites.",Article,"Ntani, G.; Coggon, D.; Felli, V.E.; Harari, F.; Barrero, L.H.; Felknor, S.A.; Rojas, M.; Serra, C.; Bonzini, M.; Merisalu, E.; Habib, R.R.; Sadeghian, F.; Wickremasinghe, A.R.; Matsudaira, K.; Nyantumbu-Mkhize, B.; Kelsall, H.L.; Harcombe, H.; Walker-Bone, K.",,CHRONIC WIDESPREAD PAIN;LOW-BACK-PAIN;MUSCULOSKELETAL PAIN;PSYCHOSOCIAL FACTORS;POPULATION;WORK;DETERMINANTS;PREVALENCE;NUMBER;SITES,United Kingdom;Brazil;Ecuador;Sweden;Colombia;United States;Costa Rica;Spain;Italy;Estonia;Lebanon;Iran;Sri Lanka;Japan;South Africa;Australia;New Zealand,2-s2.0-85131726578

Feed samples (n=38) were collected from 19 farms for the analysis of heavy metals. Samples were processed in triplicate and analyzed by plasma-coupled atomic absorption spectrometry. For the microbiological analysis, 391 samples from 22 farms were processed. For the detection of Salmonella, the MD S-3M equipment was used, and its presence was confirmed using Maldi-tof, while for the counting of E. coli cromocult agar was used. For mesophilic aerobes, the plate count agar was used and for the fungi and yeasts rose bengal agar. The results indicated that only two samples from the same farm had high arsenic values (2 ppm) while the other metals were within the expected limits. The counts of mesophiles, fungi and yeasts and Clostridium were within the Colombian regulations, with only one positive sample for Salmonella (0.25%), while 1% of the samples presented E. coli. The results reflect that the quality of concentrates used in pig feeding is not an important source of pathogens or heavy metals.",Article,"Barrientos, I.; Chamorro, I.; Zambrano, C.; Perez, M.; Gonzalez, N.; Carrascal, A.K.",feeding; pigs; heavy metals; microbiological analysis; concentrates,feeding;pigs;heavy metals;microbiological analysis;concentrates;ANIMAL FEEDS;RISK-FACTORS;SALMONELLA;FARMS;PORK;CONTAMINATION;PREVALENCE;RESIDUES;MANURES,Colombia,2-s2.0-85054579075

Multiple Sclerosis (MS) is a chronic inflammatory demyelinating disease associated with neurological disability. Clinical features include: motor function, cerebellar and visual, sensory disturbances and psychiatric comorbidities. There is little literature available on the quality of life of patients and their caregivers. Objective. Assess the quality of life of patients with MS and their caregivers in Colombia, since there is no information on the subject in this particular population to establish comprehensive management plans. Materials and methods. Was used the questionnaire MusiQol, CareQol and depression of Beck. A prospective analytical observational protocol was designed to include patients aged 18 to 65 years with diagnosis of Relapsing-Remitting MS (RR) between October 2014 and 2015 at the San Ignacio University Hospital. Quantitative variables, Spearman correlations. Data analysis with Student T-Test and Mann-Whitney U. Results. 55 patients with MS RR In 27%, chronic fatigue was the most common comorbidity. The MusiQol revealed a good basal quality of life, which remained at similar levels in the follow-ups of 6 months and 12 months. Quality of life was good during the study, since there were no statistically significant differences between baseline and follow-up MusiQol scores A good quality of life was observed in caregivers. Conclusions. The quality of life of a number of Colombian patients diagnosed with MS was very good. This positive result was also observed in caregivers, as demonstrated by the results of CareQol. We also observed and indicated an inversely proportional correlation between the EDSS and the quality of life indexes.",Article,"Beltran, E.; Diaz, D.; Diaz, C.; Zarco, L.",multiple sclerosis; patients; quality of life; caregivers; Colombia,multiple sclerosis;patients;quality of life;caregivers;Colombia;SOCIAL-CONSEQUENCES;MS PATIENTS;PREVALENCE;FATIGUE;IMPACT,Colombia,

The objective of the present study was to determine the sleep characteristics of a patient undergoing polysomnography (PSG) in three Colombian cities at different altitudes (Bogota, at 2,640 m above sea level [ASL]; Bucaramanga, at 959 m ASL; and Santa Marta, at 15 m ASL). The patient was an obese man with diabetes and suspected OSA. All PSG recordings were scored and interpreted in accordance with American Academy of Sleep Medicine criteria. In Bogota, PSG revealed moderate OSA (an apnea-hypopnea index [AHI] of 21 events/h); in Bucaramanga, PSG revealed increased upper airway resistance (an AHI of 2 events/h); in Santa Marta, PSG revealed mild OSA (an AHI of 7 events/h). The reduction in the AHI was predominantly a reduction in hypopneas and obstructive apneas. The respiratory events were shorter in duration in the city at an intermediate altitude. Given that the AHI varied widely across cities, we can assume that the patient is normal or has moderate OSA depending on the city where he is.

Previous analyses of mortality amenable to health care only focused on high-income countries and faced several methodological challenges. In the present analysis, we use the highly standardised cause of death and risk factor estimates generated through the Global Burden of Diseases, Injuries, and Risk Factors Study (GBD) to improve and expand the quantification of personal health-care access and quality for 195 countries and territories from 1990 to 2015. Methods We mapped the most widely used list of causes amenable to personal health care developed by Nolte and McKee to 32 GBD causes. We accounted for variations in cause of death certification and misclassifications through the extensive data standardisation processes and redistribution algorithms developed for GBD. To isolate the effects of personal health-care access and quality, we risk-standardised cause-specific mortality rates for each geography-year by removing the joint effects of local environmental and behavioural risks, and adding back the global levels of risk exposure as estimated for GBD 2015. We employed principal component analysis to create a single, interpretable summary measure-the Healthcare Quality and Access (HAQ) Index-on a scale of 0 to 100. The HAQ Index showed strong convergence validity as compared with other health-system indicators, including health expenditure per capita (r= 0.88), an index of 11 universal health coverage interventions (r= 0.83), and human resources for health per 1000 (r= 0.77). We used free disposal hull analysis with bootstrapping to produce a frontier based on the relationship between the HAQ Index and the Socio-demographic Index (SDI), a measure of overall development consisting of income per capita, average years of education, and total fertility rates. This frontier allowed us to better quantify the maximum levels of personal health-care access and quality achieved across the development spectrum, and pinpoint geographies where gaps between observed and potential levels have narrowed or widened over time. Findings Between 1990 and 2015, nearly all countries and territories saw their HAQ Index values improve; nonetheless, the difference between the highest and lowest observed HAQ Index was larger in 2015 than in 1990, ranging from 28.6 to 94.6. Of 195 geographies, 167 had statistically significant increases in HAQ Index levels since 1990, with South Korea, Turkey, Peru, China, and the Maldives recording among the largest gains by 2015. Performance on the HAQ Index and individual causes showed distinct patterns by region and level of development, yet substantial heterogeneities emerged for several causes, including cancers in highest-SDI countries; chronic kidney disease, diabetes, diarrhoeal diseases, and lower respiratory infections among middle-SDI countries; and measles and tetanus among lowest-SDI countries. While the global HAQ Index average rose from 40.7 (95% uncertainty interval, 39.0-42.8) in 1990 to 53.7 (52.2-55.4) in 2015, far less progress occurred in narrowing the gap between observed HAQ Index values and maximum levels achieved; at the global level, the difference between the observed and frontier HAQ Index only decreased from 21.2 in 1990 to 20.1 in 2015. If every country and territory had achieved the highest observed HAQ Index by their corresponding level of SDI, the global average would have been 73.8 in 2015. Several countries, particularly in eastern and western sub-Saharan Africa, reached HAQ Index values similar to or beyond their development levels, whereas others, namely in southern sub-Saharan Africa, the Middle East, and south Asia, lagged behind what geographies of similar development attained between 1990 and 2015. Interpretation This novel extension of the GBD Study shows the untapped potential for personal health-care access and quality improvement across the development spectrum. Amid substantive advances in personal health care at the national level, heterogeneous patterns for individual causes in given countries or territories suggest that few places have consistently achieved optimal health-care access and quality across health-system functions and therapeutic areas. This is especially evident in middle-SDI countries, many of which have recently undergone or are currently experiencing epidemiological transitions. The HAQ Index, if paired with other measures of health-systemcharacteristics such as intervention coverage, could provide a robust avenue for tracking progress on universal health coverage and identifying local priorities for strengthening personal health-care quality and access throughout the world.

Monetary and nonmonetary resources, credibility, maximization of uptake, as well as logical arguments should guide the choice of the approach and processes. Objectives: To describe a potentially efficient model for guideline production based on adoption, adaptation, and/or de novo development of recommendations utilizing the Grading of Recommendations Assessment, Development and Evaluation (GRADE) Evidence to Decision (EtD) frameworks. Study Design and Setting: We applied the model in a new national guideline program producing 22 practice guidelines. We searched for relevant evidence that informs the direction and strength of a recommendation. We then produced GRADE EtDs for guideline panels to develop recommendations. Results: We produced a total of 80 EtD frameworks in approximately 4 months and 146 EtDs in approximately 6 months in two waves. Use of the EtD frameworks allowed panel members understand judgments of others about the criteria that bear on guideline recommendations and then make their own judgments about those criteria in a systematic approach. Conclusion: The ""GRADE-ADOLOPMENT"" approach to guideline production combines adoption, adaptation, and, as needed, de novo development of recommendations. If developers of guidelines follow EtD criteria more widely and make their work publically available, this approach should prove even more useful. (C)2016 The Author(s).

The World Mental Health (WMH) Surveys allow investigation of the implications of the changing criteria compared to DSM-IV and ICD-10. Methods: WMH Surveys in 13 countries asked respondents to enumerate all their lifetime traumatic events (TEs) and randomly selected one TE per respondent for PTSD assessment. DSM-IV and ICD-10 PTSD were assessed for the 23,936 respondents who reported lifetime TEs in these surveys with the fully structured Composite International Diagnostic Interview (CIDI). DSM-5 and proposed ICD-11 criteria were approximated. Associations of the different criteria sets with indicators of clinical severity (distress-impairment, suicidality, comorbid fear-distress disorders, PTSD symptom duration) were examined to investigate the implications of using the different systems. Results: A total of 5.6% of respondents met criteria for ""broadly defined"" PTSD (i.e., full criteria in at least one diagnostic system), with prevalence ranging from 3.0% with DSM-5 to 4.4% with ICD-10. Only one-third of broadly defined cases met criteria in all four systems and another one third in only one system (narrowly defined cases). Between-system differences in indicators of clinical severity suggest that ICD-10 criteria are least strict and DSM-IV criteria most strict. The more striking result, though, is that significantly elevated indicators of clinical significance were found even for narrowly defined cases for each of the four diagnostic systems. Conclusions: These results argue for a broad definition of PTSD defined by any one of the different systems to capture all clinically significant cases of PTSD in future studies.

We tested the hypothesis that forest fragmentation sensitivity-affected by avoidance of habitat edges-should be driven by historical exposure to, and therefore species' evolutionary responses to disturbance. Using a database containing 73 datasets collected worldwide (encompassing 4489 animal species), we found that the proportion of fragmentation-sensitive species was nearly three times as high in regions with low rates of historical disturbance compared with regions with high rates of disturbance (i.e., fires, glaciation, hurricanes, and deforestation). These disturbances coincide with a latitudinal gradient in which sensitivity increases sixfold at low versus high latitudes.

We aimed to quantify the clinical effect of carbapenem resistance on mortality and length of hospital stay among inpatients in LMICs with a bloodstream infection due to Enterobacteriaceae. Methods The PANORAMA study was a multinational prospective cohort study at tertiary hospitals in Bangladesh, Colombia, Egypt, Ghana, India, Lebanon, Nepal, Nigeria, Pakistan, and Vietnam, recruiting consecutively diagnosed patients with carbapenem-susceptible Enterobacteriaceae (CSE) and carbapenem-resistant Entero-bacteriaceae (CRE) bloodstream infections. We excluded patients who had previously been enrolled in the study and those not treated with curative intent at the time of bloodstream infection onset. There were no age restrictions. Central laboratories in India and the UK did confirmatory testing and molecular characterisation, including strain typing. We applied proportional subdistribution hazard models with inverse probability weighting to estimate the effect of carbapenem resistance on probability of discharge alive and in-hospital death, and multistate modelling for excess length of stay in hospital. All patients were included in the analysis. Findings Between Aug 1, 2014, and June 30, 2015, we recruited 297 patients from 16 sites in ten countries: 174 with CSE bloodstream infection and 123 with CRE bloodstream infection. Median age was 46 years (IQR 15-61). Crude mortality was 20% (35 of 174 patients) for patients with CSE bloodstream infection and 35% (43 of 123 patients) for patients with CRE bloodstream infection. Carbapenem resistance was associated with an increased length of hospital stay (3.7 days, 95% CI 0.3-6.9), increased probability of in-hospital mortality (adjusted subdistribution hazard ratio 1.75, 95% CI 1.04-2.94), and decreased probability of discharge alive (0.61, 0.454.83). Multilocus sequence typing showed various clades, with marginal overlap between strains in the CRE and CSE clades. Interpretation Carbapenem resistance is associated with increased length of hospital stay and mortality in patients with bloodstream infections in LMICs. These data will inform global estimates of the burden of antimicrobial resistance and reinforce the need for better strategies to prevent, diagnose, and treat CRE infections in LMICs.

In the 65 articles reviewed, the most used model starting in 2001 was SWAT and starting in 2009 the most commonly used was InVEST. Eighty percent of the scientific articles have been published from 2010 to 2015 suggesting that spatial modeling of ES is an emergent research field. Only 4 of the 9 tools encountered in our review are backed by papers, the others only offer grey literature. The spatial modeling of ES is mainly done in the U.S.A. and China, and the most frequently evaluated ES are related to hydrological services (water provision and quality treatment), climate regulation and soil formation. Most of the studies are done along hydrological basins, at different spatial scales and based upon different map resolution ranging from 20 to 900 m. With concern, we observe the lack of validation of the spatial models and the tools' lack of integrated validation modules. As long as the tools used to spatially model ecosystem services continue to be used as black boxes, the models they generate will suffer from a high degree of uncertainty and will not be reliable for decision making purposes.

Although fundamental questions focus on how the different dimensions of TQM can bring about better business performance, a more recent recurring issue pertains to the relationship between TQM and technological innovation and whether technological innovation might provide a source of competitive advantage. Unfortunately, from both theoretical and empirical perspectives, the relationship between TQM and technological innovation appears contradictory and complex. This paper argues that the relationship might be better understood from the contingent perspective of strategic management and thus proposes a multidimensional intervening variable in the relationship, called Business Innovation Capability (BIC). An empirical study of 105 Spanish industrial firms reveals that the effect of some business practices suggested by TQM on technological innovation can be better understood when BIC dimensions are taken into account.",Article,"Perdomo-Ortiz, J.; Gonzalez-Benito, J.; Galende, J.",total quality management; business innovation capability; technological innovation,total quality management;business innovation capability;technological innovation;COMPETITIVE ADVANTAGE;FIRMS;PERFORMANCE;STRATEGY;CONTINGENCY;IMPACT;TQM;DETERMINANTS;COMPETENCE;SUCCESS,Spain;Colombia,2-s2.0-70449670658;2-s2.0-70449670658;2-s2.0-70449670658

However, relatively few studies have investigated the association between clinical and economic outcomes and malnutrition in hospitalized patients, particularly those with cardiac and pulmonary conditions. Methods: This multicenter prospective observational cohort study included 800 patients hospitalized at four Colombian hospitals with a diagnosis of congestive heart failure, acute myocardial infarction, community-acquired pneumonia, or chronic obstructive pulmonary disease. All patients were screened for malnutrition using the Malnutrition Screening Tool (MST). A descriptive analysis of baseline variables was followed by multivariate analysis and inverse probability weighting (IPW) to compare the clinical outcomes, i.e., length of stay (LOS), mortality, and readmission, and hospital costs associated with a positive MST result. Results: The prevalence of a positive MST result was 24.62% (n = 197) and was more common in patients with older age and greater comorbidities. Multivariate analysis controlling for age, gender, healthcare plan, university degree, hospitalization, entrance disease and Charison co-morbidity index showed that a positive MST result was associated with increased LOS (1.43 +/- 0.61 days) and both in-hospital mortality (odds ratio, 2.39) and global mortality (odds ratio, 2.52). IPW analysis confirmed the association between a positive MST result and increased hospital LOS and 30-day mortality, as well as a relative increase of 30.13% in the average cost associated with hospitalization. Conclusions: This study of hospital inpatients demonstrated a high burden of malnutrition at the time of hospital admission, which negatively impacted LOS and mortality and increased the costs of hospitalization. These findings underscore the need for improved diagnosis and treatment of hospital malnutrition to improve patient outcomes and reduce healthcare costs. (C) 2018 The Authors.

Outdoor workers, who are exposed to high ambient UVR levels are at increased risk. ObjectiveTo compare outdoor with indoor workers in terms of: (i) skin cancer risk factors, and (ii) risk of developing skin cancer. MethodsUsing descriptive methods and a large multicenter European case-control study, we compared risk factor patterns between outdoor (N=1416) and indoor workers (N=1863). Risk of developing basal cell carcinoma (BCC), squamous cell carcinoma (SCC), melanoma and actinic keratosis (AK) were analysed by type of work using multivariate logistic regression models, for three categories of work: indoor; farming/construction; other outdoor work. ResultsAlthough skin phototype was equally distributed by type of work, significantly less outdoor than indoor workers used sunscreen in their own country (44.3% vs. 60.2%), but had more outdoor hobbies (66.2% vs. 58.2%). Outdoor workers had lower educational levels, and felt less confident in understanding medical information and filling medical forms (all P<0.001). Outdoor workers had more signs of photodamage (78.1% vs. 65.5%) and among the skin cancer patients, 37.7% of outdoor workers vs. 28.6% of indoor workers had 2 skin cancers diagnosed during their lifetime.Multivariate logistic regression models showed significantly increased risk of outdoor vs. indoor work for AK (ORother outdoor=1.55, ORfarming/construction=2.58), SCC (ORother outdoor=1.32, ORfarming/construction=2.77) and BCC (ORother outdoor=1.53, ORfarming/construction=1.83). No significant associations were found for melanoma. The risk of all types of skin cancer and AK was significantly increased for workers with 5years of outdoor work. ConclusionsOutdoor workers had more risk behaviour with similar constitutional skin cancer risk factors: more UV exposure (both occupational and leisure) and less sunscreen use and lower health literacy.

It is locations like Kathmandu, Nepal, a densely populated city in South Asia with endemic typhoid fever, where this goal is most pertinent. Aiming to understand the public health implications of water quality in Kathmandu we subjected weekly water samples from 10 sources for one year to a range of chemical and bacteriological analyses. We additionally aimed to detect the etiological agents of typhoid fever and longitudinally assess microbial diversity by 16S rRNA gene surveying. We found that the majority of water sources exhibited chemical and bacterial contamination exceeding WHO guidelines. Further analysis of the chemical and bacterial data indicated site-specific pollution, symptomatic of highly localized fecal contamination. Rainfall was found to be a key driver of this fecal contamination, correlating with nitrates and evidence of S. Typhi and S. Paratyphi A, for which DNA was detectable in 333 (77%) and 303 (70%) of 432 water samples, respectively. 16S rRNA gene surveying outlined a spectrum of fecal bacteria in the contaminated water, forming complex communities again displaying location-specific temporal signatures. Our data signify that the municipal water in Kathmandu is a predominant vehicle for the transmission of S. Typhi and S. Paratyphi A.

A before-after prospective surveillance study to assess the impact of a multidimensional infection control approach for the reduction of catheter-associated urinary tract infection (CAUTI) rates. SETTING. Pediatric intensive care units (PICUs) of hospital members of the International Nosocomial Infection Control Consortium (INICC) from 10 cities of the following 6 developing countries: Colombia, El Salvador, India, Mexico, Philippines, and Turkey. PATIENTS. PICU inpatients. METHODS. We performed a prospective active surveillance to determine rates of CAUTI among 3,877 patients hospitalized in 10 PICUs for a total of 27,345 bed-days. The study was divided into a baseline period (phase 1) and an intervention period (phase 2). In phase 1, surveillance was performed without the implementation of the multidimensional approach. In phase 2, we implemented a multidimensional infection control approach that included outcome surveillance, process surveillance, feedback on CAUTI rates, feedback on performance, education, and a bundle of preventive measures. The rates of CAUTI obtained in phase 1 were compared with the rates obtained in phase 2, after interventions were implemented. RESULTS. During the study period, we recorded 8,513 urinary catheter (UC) days, including 1,513 UC-days in phase 1 and 7,000 UCdays in phase 2. In phase 1, the CAUTI rate was 5.9 cases per 1,000 UC-days, and in phase 2, after implementing the multidimensional infection control approach for CAUTI prevention, the rate of CAUTI decreased to 2.6 cases per 1,000 UC-days (relative risk, 0.43 [95% confidence interval, 0.21-1.0]), indicating a rate reduction of 57%. CONCLUSIONS. Our findings demonstrated that implementing a multidimensional infection control approach is associated with a significant reduction in the CAUTI rate of PICUs in developing countries.

Acute bronchiolitis is the leading cause of medical emergencies during winter in children younger than two years of age. Chest physiotherapy is thought to assist infants in the clearance of secretions and to decrease ventilatory effort. Objectives The main objective was to determine the efficacy of chest physiotherapy in infants aged less than 24 months old with acute bronchiolitis. A secondary objective was to determine the efficacy of different techniques of chest physiotherapy (for example, vibration and percussion and passive forced exhalation). Search methods We searched the Cochrane Central Register of Controlled Trials (CENTRAL) (The Cochrane Library 2011, Issue 4) which contains the Cochrane Acute Respiratory Infections Group's Specialised Register, MEDLINE (1966 to November week 3, 2011), MEDLINE in-process and other non-indexed citations (8 December 2011), EMBASE.com (1990 to December 2011), CINAHL (1982 to December 2011), LILACS (1985 to December 2011) and Web of Science (1985 to December 2011). Selection criteria Randomised controlled trials (RCTs) in which chest physiotherapy was compared against no intervention or against another type of physiotherapy in bronchiolitis patients younger than 24 months of age. Data collection and analysis Two review authors independently extracted data. Primary outcomes were respiratory parameters and improvement in severity of disease. Secondary outcomes were length of hospital stay, duration of oxygen supplementation and the use of bronchodilators and steroids. No pooling of data was possible. Main results Nine clinical trials including 891 participants were included comparing physiotherapy with no intervention. Five trials (246 participants) evaluated vibration and percussion techniques and four trials (645 participants) evaluated passive expiratory techniques. We observed no significant differences in the severity of disease (eight trials, 867 participants). Results were negative for both types of physiotherapy. We observed no differences between groups in respiratory parameters (two trials, 118 participants), oxygen requirements (one trial, 50 participants), length of stay (five trials, 222 participants) or severe side effects (two trials, 595 participants). Differences in mild transient adverse effects (vomiting and respiratory instability) have been observed (one trial, 496 participants). Authors' conclusions Since the last publication of this review new good-quality evidence has appeared, strengthening the conclusions of the review. Chest physiotherapy does not improve the severity of the disease, respiratory parameters, or reduce length of hospital stay or oxygen requirements in hospitalised infants with acute bronchiolitis not on mechanical ventilation. Chest physiotherapy modalities (vibration and percussion or forced expiratory techniques) have shown equally negative results.",Review,"Figuls, M.R.I.; Gine-Garriga, M.; Rugeles, C.G.; Perrotta, C.","Acute Disease; Bronchiolitis [therapy]; Drainage, Postural; Infant, Newborn; Oxygen Inhalation Therapy; Percussion [methods]; Randomized Controlled Trials as Topic; Respiratory Therapy [methods]; Vibration [therapeutic use]; Humans; Infant","Acute Disease;Bronchiolitis [therapy];Drainage, Postural;Infant, Newborn;Oxygen Inhalation Therapy;Percussion [methods];Randomized Controlled Trials as Topic;Respiratory Therapy [methods];Vibration [therapeutic use];Humans;Infant;RESPIRATORY SYNCYTIAL VIRUS;CONSENSUS CONFERENCE;RISK-FACTORS;INFANTS;MANAGEMENT;CHILDREN;GUIDELINES;DEATHS;IMPACT;CARE",Spain;Colombia;Ireland,WOS:000373285000014

In light of the advances in the reprocessing of goods to improve financial performance, the analysis of a closed-loop supply chain becomes crucial for the competitiveness of companies. We propose a multi-period model to solve the supply chain design problem in which several items must be produced through different levels after the production process, considering the flow of reverse of some products, which can be reprocessed or discarded. In this paper, we studied the design of a supply chain that includes several plants, distribution centers, collection centers, demand zones, and products; it consists of both products forward and reverses in the supply chain. Indeed, the perturbation parameters, robustness requirements, and the performance characteristics were identified qualitatively and quantitatively by determining their impact on the formulation and methodology. A variety of configurations are produced in the closed-loop supply chain, considering the variations of the uncertainty of the demand as a perturbation parameter. The objective is to maximize the economic value-added (EVA (TM)); therefore, the most robust configuration is identified through robustness- EVA (TM) characterization and used to design the closed-loop chain. Finally, we present a numerical example using real information of the electronics industry in Bogota to test the applied methodology and show that it is suitable for this type of problems.

,,,39,WOS:000292668200041,2011,Incorporating temporality and biophysical vulnerability to quantify the human spatial footprint on ecosystems,"Land use is a pervasive influence on most terrestrial ecosystems. Humans are converting natural ecosystems and appropriating an increasingly large portion of the net primary productivity of the Earth's ecosystems, leaving a rapidly expanding footprint on the environment and threatening the functioning of ecosystems and the ecological services they provide. Understanding the impacts of human activities on the environment from a local to a global scale requires an adequate representation of human modified landscapes and an explanation of the relationships between socioeconomic and biophysical factors. A first step towards this objective is the development of a quantitative measure of the spatial footprint of humans on landscapes, which can then be used as an analytical and monitoring tool for global change, biodiversity and ecosystem studies. Existing approaches have been based mainly on geographic proxies of human influence such as population density, land transformation, accessibility and infrastructure. In this paper, we developed a more comprehensive and spatially-explicit footprint index based on three dimensions: land use intensity, intervention time, and biophysical vulnerability, which we then applied to Colombia as a case study. We found the inclusion of the vulnerability index provided an effective means to address regional variability in biophysical responses to land use impacts. Accounting for the duration of human intervention provided new insights into the relative capacity of ecosystems to recover or be restored. From this knowledge, more appropriate land use policies can be developed. (C) 2011 Elsevier Ltd.

Here, we report immediate impacts of changes in human activities on wildlife and environmental threats during the early lockdown months of 2020, based on 877 qualitative reports and 332 quantitative assessments from 89 different studies. Hundreds of reports of unusual species observations from around the world suggest that animals quickly responded to the reductions in human presence. However, negative effects of lockdown on conservation also emerged, as confinement resulted in some park officials being unable to perform conservation, restoration and enforcement tasks, resulting in local increases in illegal activities such as hunting. Overall, there is a complex mixture of positive and negative effects of the pandemic lockdown on nature, all of which have the potential to lead to cascading responses which in turn impact wildlife and nature conservation. While the net effect of the lockdown will need to be assessed over years as data becomes available and persistent effects emerge, immediate responses were detected across the world. Thus, initial qualitative and quantitative data arising from this serendipitous global quasi-experimental perturbation highlights the dual role that humans play in threatening and protecting species and ecosystems.

,,,38,WOS:000301240900010,2012,The ties that bind: The relationship between caregiver burden and the neuropsychological functioning of TBI survivors,"Advances in medical and assistive technology have increased the likelihood of survival following a traumatic brain injury (TBI). Consequently, families frequently must provide care to individuals with TBI. Because they are rarely prepared for the associated demanding medical needs and financial burden, family caregivers are at risk for physical and emotional problems, which can negatively influence their individual and family functioning. Whereas scholars have examined the influence of survivor functioning on caregiver burden, few have explicitly recognized that caregiver burden also influences survivor functioning. Results of a multivariate linear regression suggest that, in a sample of 51 pairs of TBI survivors and their caregivers living in Colombia, survivors receiving care from a family member who reported a higher level of burden had poorer objective neuropsychological functioning than those receiving care from a family member who reported a lower level of burden, after controlling for survivor education and history of occupational therapy. Therefore, a family-focused approach might maximize intervention effectiveness, especially for Latin American and Hispanic families, which tend to be characterized by a strong sense of familism.

Methods: During the 6-year study period, prospective data from 532,483 ICU patients hospitalized in 242 hospitals, for an aggregate of 2,197,304 patient days, were collected through the INICC Surveillance Online System (ISOS). The Centers for Disease Control and Prevention-National Healthcare Safety Network (CDC-NHSN) definitions for device-associated health care-associated infection (DA-HAI) were applied. Results: Although device use in INICC ICUs was similar to that reported from CDC-NHSN ICUs, DA-HAI rates were higher in the INICC ICUs: in the medical-surgical ICUs, the pooled central line-associated bloodstream infection rate was higher (5.05 vs 0.8 per 1,000 central line-days); the ventilator-associated pneumonia rate was also higher (14.1 vs 0.9 per 1,000 ventilator-days,), as well as the rate of catheter-associated urinary tract infection (5.1 vs 1.7 per 1,000 catheter-days). From blood cultures samples, frequencies of resistance, such as of Pseudomonas aeruginosa to piperacillin-tazobactam (33.0% vs 18.3%), were also higher. Conclusions: Despite a significant trend toward the reduction in INICC ICUs, DA-HAI rates are still much higher compared with CDC-NHSN's ICUs representing the developed world. It is INICC's main goal to provide basic and cost-effective resources, through the INICC Surveillance Online System to tackle the burden of DA-HAIs effectively.

The Colombian health reform addressed this issue through a segmented progressive social health insurance approach. The strategy was to assure universal coverage expanding the population covered through payroll linked insurance, and implementing a subsidized insurance program for the poorest populations, those not affiliated through formal employment. A prospective study was performed to follow-up health service utilization and out-of-pocket expenses using a cohort design. It was representative of four Colombian cities (Cendex Health Services Use and Expenditure Study 2001). A four part econometric model was applied. The model related medical service utilization and medication With different socioeconomic, geographic, and risk associated variables. Results showed that subsidized health insurance improves health service utilization and reduces the financial burden for the poorest, as compared to those non-insured. Other social health insurance schemes preserved high utilization with variable out-of-pocket expenditures. Family and age conditions have significant effect on medical service utilization. Geographic variables play a significant role in hospital inpatient service utilization. Both, geographic and income variables also have significant impact on out-of-pocket expenses. Projected utilization rates and a simulation favor a dual policy for two-state income seumented insurance to progress towards the universal insurance goal.

Obesity is frequently associated with risk factors for cardiovascular and metabolic diseases. Central obesity is a marker of increased intra-abdominal adiposity and a known risk factor for atherosclerosis and diabetes; it is also a good predictor of risk for coronary events, cardiovascular mortality, diabetes and metabolic syndrome. A less predictive alternate measurement is known as the body mass index (BMI). Objective. Obesity prevalence was estimated first by BMI and then by abdominal obesity (measured by waist circumference, WC) in primary care patients. Materials and methods. As part of an international study, primary care physicians recruited consecutive patients aged 18 to 80 years who consulted for any reason on two pre-specified half-days. Age, gender, smoking status and history of cardiovascular disease or diabetes were recorded. Height, weight and WC were measured using standard methods. Pregnant women and subjects unwilling to participate were excluded. Results. A total of 3,795 patients from 105 primary care centers located throughout Colombia were evaluated. The mean age was 45 years (69% females). Of these, 60.7% of males and 53.9% of females were overweight or obese according to their BMI; 24.6% of males and 44.6% of females had abdominal obesity when National Cholesterol Education Program guidelines were used, but numbers changed to 62.5% and 67.0% when the International Diabetes Federation guidelines were used. Obesity, either determined by BMI or by WC, was associated with higher prevalence of diabetes, hypertension and dyslipidemia. Conclusions. Increased waist circumference is a practical and useful marker for cardiovascular and metabolic conditions. The prevalence of abdominal obesity in Colombian primary care patients is high and more frequent in females.",Article,"Ruiz, A.J.; Aschner, P.J.; Puerta, M.F.; Alfonso-Cristancho, R.",obesity; overweight; body weight; mortality; abdominal circumference; body mass index; risk factors,obesity;overweight;body weight;mortality;abdominal circumference;body mass index;risk factors;WAIST CIRCUMFERENCE;CARDIOVASCULAR RISK;METABOLIC SYNDROME;LATIN-AMERICA;INTRAABDOMINAL ADIPOSITY;TIME TRENDS;DISEASE;BUCARAMANGA;HEALTH;IMPACT,Colombia;United States,

To delineate this clinical association, we investigated the phenotypical features of OSA in asthmatic children. Specifically, we hypothesized that asthmatic children have a distinct OSA phenotype that involves a higher prevalence of Rapid-Eye-Movement (REM)-related breathing abnormalities relative to children with OSA alone. Methods We conducted a retrospective cross-sectional analysis of 141 children aged 2-12 years with OSA diagnosed by polysomnography (PSG) in our sleep center. Outcomes included PSG parameters, maximal %SaO2 REM desaturations and prevalence of REM-related OSA. Multivariate linear regression model or logistic regression model was built to study the joint effect of asthma and OSA parameters with control for potential confounders (significance level P<0.05). Results Baseline respiratory parameters, obstructive apnea-hypopnea index (OAHI) severity, and oxygenation during NREM sleep were unaffected by the presence of asthma in children with OSA. In contrast, maximal %SaO2 REM desaturation, REM-OAHI and prevalence of REM-related OSA in children with moderate-severe OSA were significantly increased in asthmatic children with OSA compared to subjects with OSA alone. Multivariate analysis revealed that the association between asthma and REM-related OSA parameters is independent of asthma control, BMI, age, and gender. The presence of REM-related OSA in asthmatics was unaffected by rhinitis or atopic status. Conclusion These results demonstrate that asthma is associated with REM-related breathing abnormalities in children with moderate-severe OSA. The link between asthma and REM-related OSA is independent of asthma control and obesity. Further research is needed to delineate the REM-sleep biological mechanisms that modulate the phenotypical expression of OSA in asthmatic children. Pediatr Pulmonol. 2013; 48:592-600.

A systematic search, which identified 9,976 abstracts, led to the inclusion of 58 reviews. BC mortality reduction with screening mammography was 15-25% in trials and 28-56% in observational studies in all age groups, and the risk of stage III+ cancers was reduced for women older than 49 years. Overdiagnosis due to mammography was 1-60% in trials and 1-12% in studies with a low risk of bias, and cumulative false-positive rates were lower with biennial than annual screening (3-17% vs 0.01-41%). There is no consistency in the reviews' conclusions about the magnitude of BC mortality reduction among women younger than 50 years or older than 69 years, or determinants of benefits and harms of mammography, including the type of mammography (digital vs screen-film), the number of views and the screening interval. Similarly, there was no solid evidence on determinants of benefits and harms or BC mortality reduction with screening by ultrasonography or clinical breast examination (sensitivity ranges, 54-84% and 47-69%, respectively), and strong evidence of unfavourable benefit-to-harm ratio with breast self-examination. The reviews' conclusions were not dependent on the quality of the reviews or publication date. Systematic reviews on mammography screening, mainly from high-income countries, systematically disagree on the interpretation of the benefit-to-harm ratio.

Nevertheless, the characteristics and uses in South America are unknown. Objectives: To identify sources, characteristics, and uses of RWE in Argentina, Brazil, Colombia, and Chile, and evaluate the context-specific challenges. The implications for future regulation and responsible management of RWE in the region are also considered. Methods: A systematic literature review, database mapping, and targeted gray literature search were conducted to identify the sources and characteristics of RWE. Findings were validated by key opinion leaders attending workshops in 4 South American countries. Results: A database mapping exercise revealed 407 unique databases. Geographic scope, database type, population, and outcomes captured were reported. Characteristics of national health information systems show efforts to collect interoperable data from service providers, insurers, and government agencies, but that initiatives are hampered by fragmentation, lack of stewardship, and resources. In South America, RWE is mainly used for pharmacovigilance and as pure academic research, but less so for health technology assessment decision making or pricing negotiations and not at all to inform early access schemes.

METHOD: Two hundred and seventy-one family members of an individual with TBI in Mexico, Colombia, Spain, Denmark, and Norway completed the Family Needs Questionnaire. RESULTS: Eight of the ten needs rated as most important globally were from the Health Information subscale. Importance ratings on the Health Information, Professional Support, and Involvement With Care subscales were similar across countries, but Mexican family members rated Instrumental Support needs as less important than Colombian, Spanish, and Danish family members, and also rated their Community Support needs as less important than Danish and Spanish family members. Mexican family member's rated emotional support needs as less important than Colombian, Spanish, and Danish family members. Globally, the needs rated as most often met were from the Health Information subscale, and the most unmet needs were from the Emotional Support subscale.

Historically, it has been difficult to accurately verify the rates of hypoglycemia within a clinical setting and there is a need for high-quality, real-world data to ascertain the true rates of hypoglycemia in clinical practice. The global Hypoglycemia Assessment Tool (HAT) study was designed to assess the global incidence of hypoglycemia in patients with insulin-treated diabetes, and the results have indicated that the overall incidence of hypoglycemia is high, with large variations between geographical regions. Methods: The International Operations HAT (IO HAT) study retrospectively and prospectively assessed the incidence of hypoglycemia in patients with insulin-treated diabetes in Bangladesh, Colombia, Egypt, Indonesia, Philippines, Singapore, South Africa, Turkey, and United Arab Emirates. Results: During the prospective period, hypoglycemic events were reported by 97.4% of patients with type 1 diabetes and 95.3% of those with type 2 diabetes, with an estimated rate of 6.86 events per patient permonth (PPPM) for patients with type 1 diabetes and 2.37 events PPPM for patients with type 2 diabetes. Conclusions: These results represent the first patient-reported dataset on hypoglycemia in the participating countries and confirm that hypoglycemia is under-reported and more widespread than previously believed. Although the incidence of hypoglycemiawas variable among patients on different treatment regimens, there were substantial impacts on both productivity and healthcare utilization following an episode of hypoglycemia.

A convenience sample of 550 adults living in Bogota was presented with 12 realistic stories depicting a former perpetrator of violence (a member of the guerillas, the paramilitary, or the military) who begged a victim's family for forgiveness. The vignettes were created by combining the levels of 4 factors-Identity X Apologies (has apologized and offered compensation or not) X Type of Crime (murder or destruction of property) X Level of Responsibility (mere agent or organizer)-in a Latin square design. Three different rating scales were used: a willingness to forgive scale, an acceptance in the neighborhood scale, and an acceptance as a coworker scale. Through cluster analysis, 4 personal positions regarding forgiveness were found: a never forgive under any circumstances position (29%), a hesitant position (23%), an always forgive position (18%), and a depends on circumstances position (13%). Few participants adopted positions showing that at least minimal deliberation (weighing the pros and the cons) had taken place before responding. In addition, 17% of the sample was totally undetermined. Ninety-two percent of the participants who were hostile to forgiveness or hesitant were unwilling to have former perpetrators live in their neighborhoods, and 94% were unwilling to have them as coworkers. The corresponding figures were 62% and 66%, respectively, for participants holding an always forgive position. The gut reaction to former perpetrators found regarding the possibility of forgiving extended to the issue of reintegration. Overall, and despite the fact that, from a practical viewpoint, reintegrating people into society does not imply full forgiveness, Colombian people's views on reintegration are not more favorable than are their views on forgiveness. Public Significance Statement During the past few years, and possibly as a result of the development of the peace process, Colombian citizens have become more open to the idea of forgiveness to perpetrators of violence. This change has not yet manifested itself in a visible way, however. Rather, some people who were, in the recent past, hostile to the idea of forgiveness are now in a state of indetermination. To be successful, the reintegration of former perpetrators into society must be done with care, on a voluntary basis. Some citizens are blatantly hostile to the idea of living and working in the same places as former perpetrators; it would be difficult to impose perpetrators' presence on them in these places. A minority of citizens, however, is open to this idea: The process of reintegration is, therefore, not necessarily blocked everywhere.",Article,"Lopez, W.L.; Alvarado, G.S.; Rodriguez, S.; Ruiz, C.; Leon, J.D.; Pineda-Marin, C.; Mullet, E.",forgiveness; reintegration; Colombia; paramilitary forces; guerrilla,forgiveness;reintegration;Colombia;paramilitary forces;guerrilla;INTERGROUP FORGIVENESS;NORTHERN-IRELAND;RECONCILIATION SENTIMENT;COLLECTIVE GUILT;PTSD SYMPTOMS;MENTAL-HEALTH;CONFLICT;IMPACT;ASSOCIATION;GENOCIDE,Colombia;France,2-s2.0-85044862060

Women are underrepresented in long-term studies of alcohol dependence. While gender differences in drinking behaviour have been observed when starting treatment, very few studies have investigated gender differences in long-term drinking outcomes. This paper evaluates gender differences in the long-term outcome of patients treated for alcohol dependence. Design and Methods. A cohort of 850 outpatients (19% women, age 39 +/- 9 years) treated for alcohol dependence in specialist centres of Catalonia (Spain) were followed up prospectively for 20 years. Covariance analysis was used to assess gender differences at 1, 5, 10 and 20 years in drinking behaviour, psychosocial stress and social functioning (Axes 4 and 5 of Diagnostic and Statistical Manual of Mental Disorders, Third Edition, Revised). We evaluated gender differences in drinking trajectories using a multilevel model controlling for basal differences. Results. Women started treatment earlier in their drinking career, with more symptoms of dependence. In the first year they remained in treatment longer and had more clinic visits. Women presented lower alcohol consumption than men at baseline, 5 and 10 years, and similar levels of stress and psychosocial functioning. When basal alcohol consumption, length of treatment and employment were controlled, female gender predicted less drinking at year 1 and a drinking trajectory closer to abstinence between 1 and 20 years. Discussion and Conclusions. Increased severity of alcohol dependence in women starting treatment was not associated with a worse prognosis. Women did better while under treatment and achieved a better long-term drinking outcome. Gender differences were not relevant concerning psychosocial stress and social functioning.",Article,"Bravo, F.; Gual, A.; Lligona, A.; Colom, J.",alcoholism; gender; treatment outcome; longitudinal study; multilevel analysis,alcoholism;gender;treatment outcome;longitudinal study;multilevel analysis;UNITED-STATES;WOMEN;DRINKING;ABUSE;MEN;IMPACT,Colombia;Spain,2-s2.0-84879881653;2-s2.0-84879881653

Canonical correlation results showed that the maximum and average rainfall intensities are the most influential variables to describe CSO water quantity and pollutant loads whereas the duration of the rainfall event and the rain depth seem to be the most influential variables to describe CSO pollutant concentrations. The analysis of partial least squares (PLS) regression models confirms the findings of the canonical correlation and highlights three main influences of rainfall on CSO characteristics: (i) CSO water quantity characteristics are mainly influenced by the maximal rainfall intensities, (ii) CSO pollutant concentrations were found to be mostly associated with duration of the rainfall and (iii) pollutant loads seemed to be principally influenced by dry weather duration before the rainfall event. The prediction quality of PLS models is rather low (R-2 < 0.6) but results can be useful to explore qualitatively the influence of rainfall on CSO characteristics.",Article,"Sandoval, S.; Torres, A.; Pawlowsky-Reusing, E.; Riechel, M.; Caradot, N.",canonical correlation; CSO; online monitoring; partial least squares regression; UV-Vis spectrometry,canonical correlation;CSO;online monitoring;partial least squares regression;UV-Vis spectrometry;CANONICAL CORRELATION-ANALYSIS;TURBIDITY MEASUREMENTS;WATER-QUALITY;LOADS;QUANTIFICATION;CALIBRATION;REGRESSION;IMPACT;EVENT;MODEL,Colombia;Germany,2-s2.0-84892744769

Typically, they are composed of various materials which interactions are worth for studying, to improve the prediction of some variables, such as velocities, forces and affected areas. Constitutive models and numerical methods are fundamental in broadening the knowledge of the behaviour of these phenomena. Thus, the coupling of numerical techniques, for the different constituents of debris flow is becoming indispensable to describe the behaviour of these natural events. The coupling of Smooth Particle Hydrodynamics (SPH) and Discrete Element Method (DEM) is presented in this paper to show the capacity to represent the interaction of several materials at the same time. SPH is employed to represent the fluid and soil by using different constitutive models from a continuum approach. In contrast, DEM is used to represent immersed objects such as boulders and boundary conditions. In this sense, we can couple the behaviour that occurs at very different scales in a unified framework more suitable to describe the heterogeneity of debris flows. Benchmark cases were solved to validate this new approach. The simulations show good agreement with analytical solutions, experimental results and field data.",Article,"Trujillo-Vela, M.G.; Galindo-Torres, S.A.; Zhang, X.; Ramos-Canon, A.M.; Escobar-Vargas, J.A.",SPH-DEM coupling; Benchmark validation cases; Debris flows,SPH-DEM coupling;Benchmark validation cases;Debris flows;FLUID-STRUCTURE INTERACTION;NUMERICAL-SIMULATION;FRICTIONAL CONTACT;GRANULAR-MATERIALS;LARGE-DEFORMATION;SPH MODEL;CLASSIFICATION;LANDSLIDE;IMPACT;AVALANCHE,China;Colombia;United Kingdom,2-s2.0-85086074389;2-s2.0-85086074389

Objective The purpose of this study was to assess histological and clinical characteristics and survival outcomes in Hispanic EGFR mutated lung cancer patients after disease progression. Patients and Methods EGFR mutation-positive lung cancer patients (n = 34) with acquired resistance to the EGFR-TKI erlotinib were identified from 2011 to 2015. Post-progression tumor specimens were collected for molecular analysis. Post-progression interventions, response to treatment, and survival were assessed and compared among all patients and those with and without T790M mutations. Results Mean age was 59.4 +/- 13.9 years, 65% were never-smokers, and 53% had a performance status 0-1. All patients received erlotinib as first-line treatment. Identified mutations included: 60% DelE19 (Del746-750) and 40% L858R. First-line erlotinib overall response rate (ORR) was 61.8% and progression free survival (PFS) was 16.8 months (95% CI: 13.7-19.9). Acquired resistance mutations identified were T790M mutation (47.1%); PI3K mutations (14.7%); EGFR amplification (14.7%); KRAS mutation (5.9%); MET amplification (8.8%); HER2 alterations (5.9%, deletions/insertions in e20); and SCLC transformation (2.9%). Of patients, 79.4% received treatment after progression. ORR for post-erlotinib treatment was 47.1% (CR 2/PR 14) and median PFS was 8.3 months (95% CI: 2.2-36.6). Median overall survival (OS) from treatment initiation was 32.9 months (95% CI: 30.4-35.3), and only the use of post-progression therapy affected OS in a multivariate analysis (p = 0.05).

However, studies about stigma associated with coronavirus are scarce worldwide. Aims: To determine the association between stigmatisation and fear of COVID-19 in the general population of Colombia. Method: A cross-sectional study was carried out. A total of 1,687 adults between 18 and 76 years old (M = 36.3; SD = 12.5), 41.1% health workers, filled out an online questionnaire on Stigma-Discrimination and the COVID-5 Fear Scale, adapted by the research team. Results: The proportion of high fear of COVID-19 was 34.1%; When comparing the affirmative answers to the questionnaire on stigma-discrimination towards COVID-19, it was found that the difference was significantly higher in the general population compared to health workers in most of the questions evaluated, which indicates a high level of stigmatisation in that group. An association between high fear of COVID-19 and stigma was evidenced in 63.6% of the questions in the questionnaire.

In clinical practice, there are two modalities: the professional or retrospective and the personal or real-time CGM (RT-CGM). The latest-generation sensors are more accurate and sensitive for hypoglycemia, improving adherence to self-monitoring, which has allowed optimizing glycemic control. The development of algorithms that allow the suspension of the infusion of insulin during hypoglycemia gave rise to the integrated therapy or sensor-augmented insulin pump therapy with low glucose suspend, which has proven to be an effective and safe alternative in the treatment of diabetic patients with high risk of hypoglycemia.

Design: A multinational, cross-sectional, observational study. Methods: The International ChoLesterol management Practice Study (ICLPS) investigated achievement of European Society of Cardiology (ESC)/European Atherosclerosis Society (EAS) guideline low-density lipoprotein cholesterol (LDL-C) targets in patients receiving lipid-modifying therapy in countries outside Western Europe. We examined the rate of, and association between, control of multiple risk factors in ICLPS participants with dyslipidaemia, diabetes and hypertension (N = 2377). Results: Mean (standard deviation) age of patients was 61.4 (10.4) years; 51.3% were male. Type 2 diabetes was the most common form of diabetes (prevalence, 96.9%). The prevalence of metabolic syndrome was 67.8%, obesity 40.4%, atherosclerotic disease 39.6% and coronary artery disease 33.5%. All patients were at high (38.2%) or very high (61.8%) cardiovascular risk according to ESC/EAS guidelines. Body mass index (BMI) was <25 kg/m(2) in 20.3% of patients, 62.8% had never smoked and 25.2% were former smokers. Overall, 12.2% achieved simultaneous control of LDL-C, diabetes and blood pressure. Risk factor control was similar across all participating countries. The proportion of patients achieving individual guideline-specified treatment targets was 43.9% for LDL-C, 55.5% for blood pressure and 39.3% for diabetes. Multiple correspondence analysis indicated that control of LDL-C, control of blood pressure, control of diabetes, BMI and smoking were associated.

It is considered a multicausal disease, and one of the determining factors is nutritional imbalances, which include high-fat diets. In this paper, we use the zebrafish model to assess the impact of overfeeding and a high-fat diet in somatic and cardiac parameters in young and adult zebrafish. The results show that fish receiving a high-fat diet showed greater weight gain compared to fish receiving a standard fat diet. Additionally, changes in the heart, including increases in size, a change in the triangular shape of the ventricle to a globular shape, and an increase in the thickness of the trabeculae of the spongy myocardium were observed. These changes could be indicators of cardiovascular overload. The results show that there is a direct relationship between the intake of a high-fat diet and obesity, which in turn can induce cardiac changes, supporting the hypothesis of the relationship between high-fat diets and cardiovascular risk factors. Given the genetic similarity between zebrafish and humans, these results could be extrapolated to human beings, and the findings similarly highlight the importance of incorporating a balanced diet from the early life stages to reduce the risk of cardiovascular disease.",Article,"Vargas, R.; Vasquez, I.C.",Nutrition; Body mass index; Obesity; Myocardium; Cardiovascular risk,Nutrition;Body mass index;Obesity;Myocardium;Cardiovascular risk;METABOLIC SYNDROME;BIRTH-WEIGHT;CHILDHOOD;INSULIN;HEALTH;ADIPOKINES;CHILDREN;IMPACT;GROWTH,Colombia,2-s2.0-85028325305

The World Health Organization (WHO) affirms that injuries related to burns are a global public health problem mainly in low-and middle-income countries. The first step towards reducing any preventable injury is based on accurate information. In Colombia, the basic epidemiological characteristics of burn injuries are unknown. The objectives were establishing the causes, high-risk populations, mortality rate, and tendencies of burn deaths. Methods: Observational, analytical, population-based study based on official death certificate occurred between 2000 and 2009. All codes of the International Classification of Diseases-10th Revision (ICD-10) related to burns were included. The mortality rates were standardized using the WHO world average age weights 2000-2025. To determine the tendency, an average annual percent change (AACP) was calculated. Results: A total of 5448 deaths due to burns were identified; 78.4 % were men. The crude and adjusted burn mortality rate was 1.270 and 1.302 per 100,000, respectively. The AACP was -5.25 %. Electrical injury caused the greatest number of deaths (49.5 %), followed by fire and lightning injuries. A total of 1197 (22.1 %) children were under 15 years old. The causes of deaths were different among age groups. 59.4 % deaths occurred outside health institutions. Conclusions: This study is a first step in identifying the main causes of death and groups with higher mortality rates. Electricity is the main cause of deaths due to burn injury.

The contextual resource-based dimensions improve the participating firm's performance through its impact on the job-related attitudes of the firm's personnel. Design/methodology/approach Hypotheses were tested using structural equation model to analyze a set of data collected through surveys among a sample of Colombian manufacturers. Findings This study provides empirical evidence that contributes to the scarce research in the open innovation arena about how human resources influence performance in the inter-organizational collaborative innovations. In particular, it offers strong support for the key mediating role of the employees' job-related attitudes in the relationship between complementary capabilities and innovation culture as value-creating conditions, and the participating firm's ultimate sales and financial performance. Research limitations/implications The results may be affected by the context of the data set. Further studies considering the influence of specific contextual variables, such as the type of innovation, the national culture or the type of partner, could yield richer insights that would help validate the results of this study. Practical implications This study provides useful information for managers. As well as creating the required conditions to add value in the collaborative innovation, they should work to guarantee the better job-related outcomes for the employees involved in collaborative innovation projects.

U. europaeus is widely distributed in the south-central area of Chile, which is considered a world hotspot for biodiversity conservation. In addition to its negative effects on the biodiversity of natural ecosystems, U. europaeus is one of the most severe pests for agriculture and forestry. Despite its importance as an invasive species, U. europaeus has been little studied. Although information exists on the potential distribution of the species, the interaction of the invasion process with the spatial dynamic of the landscape and the landscape-scale factors that control the presence or absence of the species is still lacking. We studied the spatial and temporal dynamics of the landscape and how these relate to U. europaeus invasion in south-central Chile. We used supervised classification of satellite images to determine the spatial distribution of the species and other land covers for the years 1986 and 2003, analysing the transitions between the different land covers. We used logistic regression for modelling the increase, decrease and permanence of U. europaeus invasion considering landscape variables. Results showed that the species covers only around 1 % of the study area and showed a 42 % reduction in area for the studied period. However, U. europaeus was the cover type which presented the greatest dynamism in the landscape. We found a strong relationship between changes in land cover and the invasion process, especially connected with forest plantations of exotic species, which promotes the displacement of U. europaeus. The model of gorse cover increase presented the best performance, and the most important predictors were distance to seed source and landscape complexity index. Our model predicted high spread potential of U. europaeus in areas of high conservation value. We conclude that proper management for this invasive species must take into account the spatial dynamics of the landscape within the invaded area in order to address containment, control or mitigation of the invasion.",Article,"Altamirano, A.; Cely, J.P.; Etter, A.; Miranda, A.; Fuentes-Ramirez, A.; Acevedo, P.; Salas, C.; Vargas, R.",Land use/cover change; Biological invasions; Logistic regression; Remote sensing; Forest plantations; Biodiversity conservation,Land use/cover change;Biological invasions;Logistic regression;Remote sensing;Forest plantations;Biodiversity conservation;ALIEN PLANT INVASIONS;KUNZEA-ERICOIDES;FOREST LOSS;GORSE;BIODIVERSITY;DISTURBANCE;IMPACT;PERFORMANCE;KANUKA,Chile;Colombia,2-s2.0-84979998270

The sustainability maturity model proposed here for MSMEs is capable of supporting the efforts of companies in their attempts to achieve both environmental sustainability and an improvement in their production systems. The model encompasses a four-level qualitative scale and uses supervised classification algorithms to categorize companies through data analysis techniques. After applying the model to a group of MSMEs from different productive sectors in Colombia, the results have shown that 6% of the companies were at an insufficient level, 31% were at an initial level, 45% at a developed sustainability maturity level, and 18% at a consolidated level.

Thus, our study aims at investigating configural, metric and scalar invariance across the German and the Spanish version of the GHQ-12 in two population samples. The GHQ-12 was applied in two large-scale population-based samples in Germany (N=1,977) and Colombia (N=1,500). To investigate measurement equivalence, confirmatory factor analyses were conducted in both samples. In the German sample mean GHQ-12 total scores were higher than in the Colombian sample. A one-factor model including response bias on the negatively worded items showed superior fit in the German and the Colombian sample; thus both versions of the GHQ-12 showed configural invariance. Factor loadings and intercepts were not equal across both samples; thus GHQ-12 showed no metric and scalar invariance. As both versions of the GHQ-12 did not show measurement equivalence, it is not recommendable to compare both measures and to conclude that mental distress is higher in the German sample, although we do not know if the differences are attributable to measurement problems or represent a real difference in mental distress.

To address this problem, healthcare managers could aim at improving attendance levels or minimizing the operational impact of no-shows by adapting resource allocation policies. However, given the uncertainty of patient behaviour, generating relevant information regarding no-show probabilities could support the decision-making process for both approaches. In this context many researchers have used multiple regression models to identify patient and appointment characteristics than can be used as good predictors for no-show probabilities. This work develops a Decision Support System (DSS) to support the implementation of strategies to encourage attendance, for a preventive care program targeted at underserved communities in Bogota, Colombia. Our contribution to literature is threefold. Firstly, we assess the effectiveness of different machine learning approaches to improve the accuracy of regression models. In particular, Random Forest and Neural Networks are used to model the problem accounting for non-linearity and variable interactions. Secondly, we propose a novel use of Layer-wise Relevance Propagation in order to improve the explainability of neural network predictions and obtain insights from the modelling step. Thirdly, we identify variables explaining no-show probabilities in a developing context and study its policy implications and potential for improving healthcare access. In addition to quantifying relationships reported in previous studies, we find that income and neighbourhood crime statistics affect no-show probabilities.

In 2004 the district government of Bogota initiated a Primary Health Care (PHC) strategy to improve health care access and population health status. This study aims to analyse the contribution of the PHC strategy to the improvement of health outcomes controlling for socioeconomic variables. Methods: A longitudinal ecological analysis using data from secondary sources was carried out. The analysis used data from 2003 and 2007 (one year before and 3 years after the PHC implementation). A Primary Health Care Index (PHCI) of coverage intensity was constructed. According to the PHCI, localities were classified into two groups: high and low coverage. A multivariate analysis using a Poisson regression model for each year separately and a Panel Poisson regression model to assess changes between the groups over the years was developed. Dependent variables were infant mortality rate, under-5 mortality rate, infant mortality rate due to acute diarrheal disease and pneumonia, prevalence of acute malnutrition, vaccination coverage for diphtheria, pertussis, tetanus (DPT) and prevalence of exclusive breastfeeding. The independent variable was the PHCI. Control variables were sewerage coverage, health system insurance coverage and quality of life index. Results: The high PHCI localities as compared with the low PHCI localities showed significant risk reductions of under-5 mortality (13.8%) and infant mortality due to pneumonia (37.5%) between 2003 and 2007. The probability of being vaccinated for DPT also showed a significant increase of 4.9%. The risk of infant mortality and of acute malnutrition in children under-5 years was lesser in the high coverage group than in the low one; however relative changes were not statistically significant.

Methods A cross-sectional, population-based study was conducted in men and women >= 18 years using directed interviews and self-administered questionnaires in five main cities in Colombia. A sample size of 1054 subjects was estimated (prevalence of LUTS/OAB 15%, CI 95%, statistical power 80%, precision 3%). We used a multi-stage probabilistic sampling technique to randomly select individuals in the community, stratified by socioeconomic status, gender, and age. We used the 2002 ICS and 2010 IUGA/ICS definitions as well as validated questionnaires in Spanish. Descriptive statistics were employed. Results A total of 1060 participants were included. Mean age was 42 (range 18-89) years. The prevalence of at least one LUTS was 84%, while overactive bladder was reported by 31.8% participants. Among individuals with at least one LUTS, 13.2% would feel ""mostly unsatisfied,"" ""unhappy,"" or ""terrible"" to spend the rest of their lives with their current urinary condition.

We also separate the information effect from the effect of being aware of the system. We combined a randomized field intervention in a university cafeteria in Bogota, Colombia with data from an after-purchase survey and receipts. We found that randomly providing information on Nutri-Score increased total expenditure by $0.18. Additional spending on healthier items was 21% or $0.26 higher, with no change for less healthy items. Expenditure estimates were higher among customers who were aware of the system's existence. Customers in the study were also 10% more likely to buy a healthier item than control customers were, and the concentration of protein in their purchases was greater.

The objective of this study was to model the potential distribution of Mountain cloud forests in the Transversal Volcanic System, Michoacan and to analyze the role of these areas in maintaining landscape connectivity. Potential distribution was modeled for the Mountain cloud forests based on the maximum entropy approach using 95 occurrence points and 17 ecological variables at 30 m spatial resolution. Potential connectivity was then evaluated by using a probability of connectivity index based on graph theory. The percentage of variation (dPCk) was used to identify the individual contribution of each potential area of Mountain cloud forests in overall connectivity. The different ways in which the potential areas of Mountain cloud forests can contribute to connectivity were evaluated by using the three fractions derived from dPCk (dPCintrak, dPCfluxk, and dPCconnectork). We determined that 37,567 ha of the TVSMich are optimal for the presence of Mountain cloud forests. The contribution of said area in the maintenance of connectivity was low.

However, it has been demonstrated that a pre-treatment, such as its transformation by saprophytic fungi, is required before DOR soil application. A greenhouse experiment was designed where 0 and 50 g kg(-1) of raw DOR (DOR), Coriolopsis floccosa-transformed DOR (CORDOR) and Fusarium oxysporum-transformed DOR (FUSDOR) were added to soil. Analyses of the soil chemical properties as well as the structure and relative abundance of bacterial and actinobacterial communities were conducted after 0, 30 and 60 days following amendment. The different amendments produced a slight decrease in soil pH and significant increases in carbon fractions, C/N ratios, phenols and K, with these increases being more significant after DOR application. Quantitative PCR assays of the 16S rRNA gene and PLFA analyses showed that all amendments favoured bacterial growth at 30 and 60 days, although actinobacterial proliferation was more evident after CORDOR and FUSDOR application at 60 days. Bacterial and actinobacterial DGGE multivariate analyses showed that the amendments produced structural changes in both communities, especially after 60 days of amendment. PLFA data analysis identified changes in soil microbial communities according to the amendment considered, with FUSDOR and CORDOR being less disruptive than DOR.

We incorporated the variation associated with the ranking of institutions simulating its random effects under a binomial distribution. Methods: A nationwide survey on structure, technology, and staffing resources available in Colombian intensive care units during 1997-1998 was conducted. We collected data on admissions from 20 randomly selected adult medical and surgical intensive care units. Results: The mortality ratio from the 20 intensive care units ranged from 0.59 to 2.36; 80% of the intensive care units had a mortality ratio greater than 1. All four intensive care units with the lowest mortality ratio belonged to private institutions, while four of five institutions with the highest mortality belonged to the public sector. Intensive care units in private institutions also had fewer number of beds, lower median length of stay, lower occupancy rates, higher education training for specialists and nurses and fewer emergency nonelective surgical procedures. Conclusion: We successfully accounted for intensive care mortality baseline differences and random effects variations. There were substantial differences between intensive care units in institution type, bed availability, technology, staffing resources, and degree of training, which may have been associated with patient outcome.

,,,9,WOS:000688608600002,2021,Beyond the Circular Economy Theory: Implementation Methodology for Industrial SMEs,"Purpose: The circular economy has multiple benefits and opportunities to achieve sustainability and a better future for the next generations. The purpose of this paper is to propose a methodology that guides step-by-step any industrial SMEs in the transition from the linear to a circular model. Small and medium enterprises (SMEs) have a crucial role in the sustainable development transition, considering that they represent most of the world's companies. Design/methodology/approach: To develop this methodology, two research techniques were used: a focus group and storyboarding. Findings: The resulting methodology, called Ecopyme, comprises five steps: 1) Firm identity, 2) Diagnosis, 3) Planning, 4) Get the ball rolling, and 5) Assessment and feedback. In addition, two key criteria that must be included in the whole process were identified: value creation in the firm through a circular economy and organization commitment from the top management to the staff. Research limitations/implications: The Ecopyme methodology has two limitations: It does not propose either implementation tools or involve consumers and actors at the meso (e.g., eco-industrial parks) and macro (e.g., cities, provinces, countries) levels. Practical implications: This study will help policymakers understand the SMEs' perspective and remove barriers that may hinder the paradigm shift. The methodology is also a useful tool for consultants and entrepreneurs to incorporate the circular economy (CE) principles into their business. Originality/value: In the CE literature, little attention has been paid to proposing a structured methodology to implement CE in SMEs. Thus, the study provides a step-by-step methodology that guides any industrial SMEs to transition from linear to circular. Also, it provides additional evidence concerning the importance of human commitment in changing firms' paradigm because people can encourage the adoption of responsible production practices if firms commit CEOs, sustainability managers, and staff.",Article,"Prieto-Sandoval, V.; Torres-Guevara, L.E.; Ormazabal, M.; Jaca, C.",circular economy implementation; strategic management; sustainable improvement; SMEs; storyboarding,circular economy implementation;strategic management;sustainable improvement;SMEs;storyboarding;SUSTAINABILITY;STRATEGY;LINKING;IMPACT;CHINA,Colombia;Spain,2-s2.0-85106905771;2-s2.0-85106905771

Human papillomavirus (HPV) vaccines are a promising alternative for disease control; however, their introduction is slow in settings with greater need. We conducted a review of HPV vaccine efficacy and effectiveness reported in clinical trials and population-based studies. Efficacy of HPV vaccines is close to 100% when using a three-dose schedule in HPV-negative young women (<25 years old) for protection against persistent infection and HPV vaccine-type associated pre-cancerous lesions. Furthermore, sustained protection for up to 12 years of follow-up has been demonstrated; cross-protection against non-vaccine types is particularly observed for the bivalent vaccine, and preliminary data regarding impact on invasive cancer have emerged. Given its lower efficacy, catch-up vaccination beyond 19 years of age and proposals for vaccinating adult women deserve careful evaluation in accurately designed studies and economic analyses. Despite positive results regarding immunogenicity and post-hoc analysis for cervical intra-epithelial neoplasia in clinical trials, population-based data for prime and booster two-dose schedules are not available. Evaluation of vaccine safety from surveillance systems in immunization programs that have already distributed more than 270 million doses found no association of HPV vaccination with serious side effects. The introduction of HPV vaccination in national immunization programs remains the main challenge in tackling the burden of cervical cancer (up to 2018, only 89 countries have introduced vaccination worldwide, and most of these are high-income countries). Access models and technical capacity require further development to help low- and middle-income countries to increase the pace of vaccine delivery. Alternative approaches such as one-dose schedules and vaccination at younger ages may help reduce the programmatic and economic challenges to adolescent vaccination.",Review,"Murillo, R.; Ordonez-Reyes, C.",papillomavirus vaccines; uterine cervical neoplasms; cervical intraepithelial neoplasia; immunisation programs; primary prevention; population impact; clinical efficacy; safety,papillomavirus vaccines;uterine cervical neoplasms;cervical intraepithelial neoplasia;immunisation programs;primary prevention;population impact;clinical efficacy;safety;MIDDLE-INCOME COUNTRIES;GRADE CERVICAL LESIONS;COST-EFFECTIVENESS;UNIVERSAL VACCINATION;HERD-IMMUNITY;CANCER;IMPACT;VACCINES;PREVALENCE;CHALLENGES,Colombia,2-s2.0-85071775286

These studies have shown a great diversity of positions among participants, ranging from ""zero tolerability"" to ""non-zero tolerability"", to high tolerance to favoritism, and to complete tolerability. The present study analyzed Colombian lay persons' views as a function of three separate factors characterizing acts of corruption: (a) the current status or position in society of the person who behaved in a corrupt way (politician, judge, entrepreneur or ordinary citizen), (b) the motive behind the act of corruption (nepotism or monetary gain), and (c) the means used for obtaining the underserved benefit (threatening the person, bribery or illicitly sharing of confidential information). As expected, four qualitatively different perspectives were identified. The first one (60 % of the participants) was the expected Zero Tolerance view because all acceptability ratings were extremely low. The second one (32 %) was called Never Very Tolerable because ratings, although always low, varied as a function of the means used: Threat and bribery were considered as more intolerable than use of information. The third one (7 %) was called Depends on Means because the ratings were affected by the means used to a larger extent than in the preceding case. The fourth one (1 %) was called Always Tolerable because in all cases, the ratings were high. In no cases did acceptability depend much on the status of the person performing the corrupt act or of the motives behind the act. Although only a small minority of participants agreed with the last two views, it is probably enough to create a climate of suspicion in the country.",Article,"Lopez, W.L.; Bocarejo, M.A.R.; Peralta, D.R.; Marin, C.P.; Mullet, E.",Corruption; Threat; Bribery; Politicians; Entrepreneurs; Colombia,Corruption;Threat;Bribery;Politicians;Entrepreneurs;Colombia;PERCEPTION;ATTITUDES;PAYMENTS;PEOPLES;IMPACT,Colombia;France,2-s2.0-84976618906;2-s2.0-84976618906;2-s2.0-84976618906

Objective: To evaluate the risk factors for presentation of bacteremia due to carbapenem-resistant P. aeruginosa acquired in the Hospital Universitario San Ignacio between January 2008 and June 2014. Materials and methods: This was a case control study in which the case patients presented bacteremia due to P. aeruginosa resistant to carbapenems and the control group included patients with P. aeruginosa susceptible to this group of antibiotics. Variables such as the previous use of meropenem and ertapenem, immunosuppression and neoplasia were measured. Mortality and duration of hospital were also described. Results: In all, 168 patients were evaluated, of which 42 were cases and 126 controls. Using a multivariate model, the risk factors related to bacteremia due to carbapenem-resistant P. aeruginosa acquired in hospital were the following: use of parenteral nutrition (OR=8.28; 95% CI: 2.56-26.79; p=0); use of meropenem (OR=1.15; 95% CI: 1.03-1.28; p=0.01); and use of ciprofloxacin (OR=81.99; 95% CI: 1.14-5884; p=0.043). Conclusion: In order to prevent the emergence of carbapenem-resistant P. aeruginosa, antimicrobial control programs should be strengthened by promoting the prudent administration of carbapenems and quinolones. The correct use of parenteral nutrition should also be monitored.",Article,"Valderrama, S.L.; Gonzalez, P.F.; Caro, M.A.; Ardila, N.; Ariza, B.; Gil, F.; Alvarez, C.",Pseudomonas aeruginosa; risk factors; parenteral nutrition; bacteremia; parenteral nutrition; ciprofloxacin,Pseudomonas aeruginosa;risk factors;parenteral nutrition;bacteremia;ciprofloxacin;BLOOD-STREAM INFECTIONS;GRAM-NEGATIVE BACILLI;INTENSIVE-CARE-UNIT;PARENTERAL-NUTRITION;ANTIMICROBIAL RESISTANCE;ANTIBIOTIC-THERAPY;IMPACT;MORTALITY;IMIPENEM;ERTAPENEM,Colombia,
,,,9,WOS:000467584200014,2019,"Species sorting and mass effect along forest succession: Evidence from taxonomic, functional, and phylogenetic diversity of amphibian communities","Species recovery after forest disturbance is a highly studied topic in the tropics, but considerable debate remains on the role of secondary forests as biodiversity repositories, especially regarding the functional and phylogenetic dimensions of biodiversity. Also, studies generally overlook how alpha and beta diversities interact to produce gamma diversity along successional gradients. We used a metacommunity approach to assess how species sorting (i.e., environmental filtering) and mass effect (i.e., source-sink dynamics) affect 14 complementary metrics of amphibian taxonomic, functional, and phylogenetic diversity along a successional gradient in southern Mexico. As amphibians have narrow environmental tolerances and low dispersal capabilities, we expected that species sorting may be relatively more important than mass effect in structuring amphibian communities. Between 2010 and 2012, we sampled frogs, salamanders, and caecilians in 23 communities distributed in four successional stages: young (2-5 years old) and intermediate (13-28 years old) secondary forests, old-growth forest fragments, and old-growth continuous forest. We assessed 15 ecologically relevant functional traits per species and used a time-calibrated molecular phylogeny. We recorded 1,672 individuals belonging to 30 species and 11 families. Supporting our expectations from the species sorting perspective, from the poorest (younger forests) to the best quality (continuous forest) scenarios, we observed (a) an increase in alpha diversity regardless of species abundances; (b) a clear taxonomic segregation across successional stages; (c) an increase in functional richness and dispersion; (d) an increase in mean phylogenetic distance and nearest taxon index; and (e) a reduction in mean nearest taxon distance. However, 10 species occurred in all successional stages, resulting in relatively low beta diversity. This supports a mass effect, where interpatch migrations contribute to prevent local extinctions and increase compositional similarity at the regional scale. Our findings indicate that amphibian metacommunities along forest successional gradients are mainly structured by species sorting, but mass effects may also play a role if high levels of forest cover are conserved in the region. In fact, secondary forests and forest fragments can potentially safeguard different aspects of amphibian diversity, but their long-term conservation value requires preventing additional deforestation.",Article,"Hernandez-Ordonez, O.; Santos, B.A.; Pyron, R.A.; Arroyo-Rodriguez, V.; Urbina-Cardona, J.N.; Martinez-Ramos, M.; Parra-Olea, G.; Reynoso, V.H.",anuran; caecilian; environmental filtering; metacommunity; salamander; secondary forest,anuran;caecilian;environmental filtering;metacommunity;salamander;secondary forest;RAIN-FOREST;METAPOPULATION DYNAMICS;ASSEMBLAGES;CONSERVATION;LANDSCAPE;RECOVERY;REPTILES;ECOLOGY;IMPACT;ENVIRONMENT,Mexico;Brazil;United States;Colombia,2-s2.0-85065471982;2-s2.0-85065471982

Hypertension guidelines recommendation on attaining SBP levels < 150 mmHg in this population is currently based on experts' opinion. To clarify this issue, we systematically reviewed and quantified available evidence on the impact of achieving different SBP levels < 150 mmHg on various adverse outcomes in subjects aged >= 60 years old receiving antihypertensive drug treatment. Methods: We searched 8 databases to identify randomized controlled trials (RCTs) and post-hoc analyses or subanalyses of RCTs reporting the effects of attaining different SBP levels < 150 mmHg on the risk of stroke, acute myocardial infarction, heart failure, cardiovascular mortality and all-cause mortality in participants aged >= 60 years. We performed random-effects meta-analyses stratified by study design. Results: Eleven studies (> 33,600 participants) were included. Compared with attaining SBP levels >= 140 mmHg, levels of 130 to < 140 mmHg were not associated with lower risk of outcomes in the meta-analysis of RCTs, whereas there was an associated reduction of cardiovascular mortality (RR 0.72, 95% CI 0.59-0.88) and all-cause mortality (RR 0.86, 95% CI 0.75-0.99) in the meta-analysis of post-hoc analyses or subanalyses of RCTs. Limited and conflicting data were available for the SBP levels of < 130 mmHg and 140 to < 150 mmHg. Conclusions: Among older people, there is suggestive evidence that achieving SBP levels of 130 to < 140 mmHg is associated with lower risks of cardiovascular and all-cause mortality.

How citizens, academics, and leaders explain climate-related risk and disasters in Latin America and the Caribbean","For decades, social scientists have attempted to reveal the real causes behind disasters. While some scholars have recently focused almost exclusively on people's vulnerabilities, the majority recognize that disasters result from a combination of people's choices and hazards. Agencies and government officials, on the other hand, have often downplayed the political component of disasters (particularly those linked to global warming), preferring to focus on the technical and managerial aspects of climate response. This study explores how activists in informal settlements, academics, and governments in the Global South explain climate-related risk and disasters. The study is based on interviews, workshops, and group meetings in Haiti, Cuba, Chile, and Colombia, and on a fouryear analysis of implementation activities where community leaders were given financial resources to create risk reduction initiatives. Results show that there are significant mismatches between understandings of climate effects by people in informal settlements and decision-makers. Besides, whereas some scholars tend to focus on an anthropocentric view of risk and consider climate a component of ""the hazard,"" residents perceive it as a factor of their vulnerability and a threat to their territories and ecosystems. These results challenge some popular definitions of climate risk and suggest that modern epistemologies of disasters are inappropriate to set up effective risk reduction in the Global South.

Many studies have reported contradictory results regarding changes in the biomarker profile after neoadjuvant therapy (NAT). Given its clinical implications for the disease management, we aimed to analyze changes in ER, PR, HER2, and Ki67 expression in paired core-needle biopsies and surgical samples in breast cancer patients that had either been treated or not with NAT. Methods We included 139 patients with confirmed diagnosis of invasive ductal breast carcinoma from the Colombian National Cancer Institute. Variation in biomarker profile were assessed according to NAT administration (NAT and no-NAT treated cases) and NAT scheme (hormonal, cytotoxic, cytotoxic + trastuzumab, combined). Chi-squared and Wilcoxon signed-rank test were used to identify changes in biomarker status and percentage expression, respectively, in the corresponding groups. Results We did not find any significant variations in biomarker status or expression values in the no-NAT group. In cases previously treated with NAT, we did find a statistically significant decrease in Ki67 (p < 0.001)and PR (p = 0.02605) expression. When changes were evaluated according to NAT scheme, we found a significant decrease in both Ki67 status (p = 0.02977) and its expression values (p < 0.001) in cases that received the cytotoxic treatment. Conclusions Our results suggest that PR and Ki67 expression can be altered by NAT administration, whereas cases not previously treated with NAT do not present IHC biomarker profile variations.

Few studies have considered this subject, and they have reported both the ineffectiveness and effectiveness of ICT tools for sharing tacit knowledge. Design/methodology/approach - In this study, the participants comprised 217 knowledge workers from New Zealand and researchers who attended a knowledge management conference in the UK. In all, 59% of the sample was men and 41% women. The research model compared the scores of knowledge workers in two categories of ICT, those that allow dialogue and those that do not, in relation to knowledge sharing in organizations. The instrument used a Likert scale with five levels of response. Findings - It was found that not all ICT technologies let tacit knowledge to be shared, but those ICT that facilitate dialogue, for example, text messaging and video conferences. Emails did not facilitate the exchange of tacit knowledge. Research limitations/implications - It is suggested to replicate the study with different countries to evaluate the role of culture in the communication of tacit knowledge. Practical implications - An implication for practitioners based on this study is that email should not be the preferred mode for transferring knowledge between an organization and their workers. This mode is adequate for the exchange of explicit knowledge, but it has a limited capacity for transferring tacit knowledge. Thus, organizations may increase the use of audio and video tools to transfer electronically tacit knowledge. Interaction or socialization may facilitate the understanding and internalization of tacit knowledge by workers. Originality/value - This study contributed to understand the reason for contradictory results from previous research. ICT tools are effective to share tacit knowledge when they facilitate dialogue. Results also support practitioners about how to obtain more effective exchange of tacit knowledge in organizations.",Article,"Castaneda, D.I.; Toulson, P.",Knowledge sharing; Organizations; Tacit knowledge; Knowledge management; Communication; ICT tools,Knowledge sharing;Organizations;Tacit knowledge;Knowledge management;Communication;ICT tools;SOCIAL MEDIA;SYSTEMS SUCCESS;MANAGEMENT;IMPACT;BEHAVIOR;TEAM,Colombia;New Zealand,2-s2.0-85104076232

However, there is a lack of knowledge about the prevalence and the impact of nutritional risk on outcomes in Colombia. The aim of the present study was to determine the prevalence of nutritional risk, to know how nutrition screening is routinely performed and to determine the impact of nutritional risk on the outcomes of in-hospital mortality and being discharged home outcomes. Methods: We conducted a descriptive analysis of selected data from 7 consecutive, annual, and crosssectional nutritionDay samples (2009-2015) including a total of 7,994 adult patients in 248 units in Colombia. Data is contrasted with the Latin American and worldwide results. The prevalence of nutritional risk was determined according to the malnutrition screening tool (MST). The impact of nutritional risk in Colombian patients regarding outcomes was assessed by a Fine and Gray competing risk regression model controlling for PANDORA score (age, BMI, length of stay before nutritionDay, cancer diagnosis, and mobility). Results: The prevalence of nutritional risk (MST score >= 2) in Colombia was 38%, 41% in Latin America, and 32% worldwide. Half of the Colombian units screened patients for malnutrition or nutritional risk on admission to hospital, compared to 80% in Latin America and 62% worldwide. Only 23% of the Colombian patients identified as being at nutritional risk in the nutritionDay survey received any nutritional therapy. The hospital mortality hazard ratio of Colombian patients at nutritional risk defined by MST was 1.94 (95% CI, 1.53,2.46; p < 0.001) and 0.82 of being discharged home (95% CI, 0.76,0.88, p < 0.001). Conclusions: This is the first large-scale study in Colombia evaluating the impact of nutritional risk on clinical outcomes showing an increase of in-hospital mortality and a reduction of being discharged home. Moreover, the study shows that nutritional risk is still highly prevalent worldwide implying the need to promote an optimal nutritional care. The participation of Latin American countries in the nutritionDay survey is an opportunity to increase knowledge and awareness of these issues.

However, there are no available data on SSI rates stratified by surgical procedure (SP) in Colombia. Methods: From January 2008-December 2010, a prospective surveillance study on SSIs was conducted by the International Nosocomial Infection Control Consortium (INICC) in 4 hospitals in 4 cities within Colombia using the definitions of the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention-National Healthcare Safety Network (CDC-NHSN). SPs were classified into 10 types, according to ICD-9 criteria. Results: We recorded 193 SSIs associated with 5,063 SPs. SSI rates per type of SP were the following, compared with INICC and CDC-NHSN rates, respectively: 9.1% for laminectomy (vs 1.7% and 1.0%), 8.3% for cardiac surgery (vs 5.6% and 1.3%), 3.9% for appendix surgery (vs 2.9% and 1.4%), 5.5% for abdominal hysterectomy (vs 2.7% and 1.6%), 4.4% for prostate surgery (vs 2.1% and 1.2%), 4.5% for spleen surgery (vs 5.6% and 2.3%), 4.3% for vaginal hysterectomy (vs 2.0% and 0.9%), and 3.0% for gallbladder surgery (vs 2.5% and 0.6%).

LP analyses were performed to identify nutrients whose requirements were difficult to achieve using local foods as consumed; and to test and compare the NCFg and alternative food-based recommendations (FBRs) on the basis of dietary adequacy, for 11 micronutrients, at the population level. Results: Thiamine recommended nutrient intakes for these young children could not be achieved given local foods as consumed. NCFg focusing only on meat, fruits, vegetables, and breast milk ensured dietary adequacy at the population level for only 4 micronutrients, increasing to 8 of 11 modelled micronutrients when the FBRs promoted legumes, dairy, vitamin A-rich vegetables, and chicken giblets. None of the FBRs tested ensured population-level dietary adequacy for thiamine, niacin, and iron unless a fortified infant food was recommended. Conclusions: The present study demonstrated the value of using LP to adapt NCFg for a different age group than the one for which they were designed. Our analyses suggest that to ensure dietary adequacy for 12- to 23-month olds these adaptations should include legumes, dairy products, vitamin A-rich vegetables, organ meat, and a fortified food.",Article,"Tharrey, M.; Olaya, G.A.; Fewtrell, M.; Ferguson, E.",dietary practices; food-based recommendations; micronutrients; nutritional adequacy; young children,dietary practices;food-based recommendations;micronutrients;nutritional adequacy;young children;BREAST-FED INFANTS;IRON INTAKE;GROWTH;MEAT;INTERVENTIONS;GUIDELINES;NUTRIENTS;LACTATION;IMPACT;LIFE,United Kingdom;Colombia,2-s2.0-85021173051
,,,6,WOS:000366545900034,2015,A polymorphism in the base excision repair gene PARP2 is associated with differential prognosis by chemotherapy among postmenopausal breast cancer patients,"Background: Personalized therapy considering clinical and genetic patient characteristics will further improve breast cancer survival. Two widely used treatments, chemotherapy and radiotherapy, can induce oxidative DNA damage and, if not repaired, cell death. Since base excision repair (BER) activity is specific for oxidative DNA damage, we hypothesized that germline genetic variation in this pathway will affect breast cancer-specific survival depending on treatment. Methods: We assessed in 1,408 postmenopausal breast cancer patients from the German MARIE study whether cancer specific survival after adjuvant chemotherapy, anthracycline chemotherapy, and radiotherapy is modulated by 127 Single Nucleotide Polymorphisms (SNPs) in 21 BER genes. For SNPs with interaction terms showing p < 0.1 (likelihood ratio test) using multivariable Cox proportional hazard analyses, replication in 6,392 patients from nine studies of the Breast Cancer Association Consortium (BCAC) was performed. Results: rs878156 in PARP2 showed a differential effect by chemotherapy (p = 0.093) and was replicated in BCAC studies (p = 0.009; combined analysis p = 0.002). Compared to non-carriers, carriers of the variant G allele (minor allele frequency = 0.07) showed better survival after chemotherapy (combined allelic hazard ratio (HR) = 0.75, 95 % 0.53-1.07) and poorer survival when not treated with chemotherapy (HR = 1.42, 95 % 1.08-1.85). A similar effect modification by rs878156 was observed for anthracycline-based chemotherapy in both MARIE and BCAC, with improved survival in carriers (combined allelic HR = 0.73, 95 % CI 0.40-1.32). None of the SNPs showed significant differential effects by radiotherapy. Conclusions: Our data suggest for the first time that a SNP in PARP2, rs878156, may together with other genetic variants modulate cancer specific survival in breast cancer patients depending on chemotherapy. These germline SNPs could contribute towards the design of predictive tests for breast cancer patients.",Article,"Seibold, P.; Schmezer, P.; Behrens, S.; Michailidou, K.; Bolla, M.K.; Wang, Q.; Flesch-Janys, D.; Nevanlinna, H.; Fagerholm, R.; Aittomaki, K.; Blomqvist, C.; Margolin, S.; Mannermaa, A.; Kataja, V.; Kosma, V.M.; Hartikainen, J.M.; Lambrechts, D.; Wildiers, H.; Kristensen, V.; Alnaes, G.G.; Nord, S.; Borresen-Dale, A.L.; Hooning, M.J.; Hollestelle, A.; Jager, A.; Seynaeve, C.; Li, J.M.; Liu, J.J.; Humphreys, K.; Dunning, A.M.; Rhenius, V.; Shah, M.; Kabisch, M.; Torres, D.; Ulmer, H.U.; Hamann, U.; Schildkraut, J.M.; Purrington, K.S.; Couch, F.J.; Hall, P.; Pharoah, P.; Easton, D.F.; Schmidt, M.K.; Chang-Claude, J.; Popanda, O.",Survival; Genetic variation; Chemotherapy; Radiotherapy; Anthracyclines,Survival;Genetic variation;Chemotherapy;Radiotherapy;Anthracyclines;STRESS-RELATED GENES;POLY(ADP-RIBOSE) POLYMERASES;DOXORUBICIN;EXPRESSION;RISK;IMPACT;DAMAGE;XRCC1,Germany;United Kingdom;Finland;Sweden;Belgium;Norway;Netherlands;Singapore;Colombia;United States,2-s2.0-84959139071

To assess the quality and public health risk of different types of water, the fecal indicator bacteria (FIB) are used. However, some pathogens, such as Helicobacter pylori, may be present in water when FIB cannot be found.Hpylori is recognized as the causative agent of chronic gastritis, peptic and duodenal ulcers, and gastric cancer. The aim of this study was to evaluate the relationships among physicochemical parameters, FIB concentrations, and the presence of Hpylori DNA in raw and drinking water from Bogota, Colombia. Materials and MethodsA total of 310 water samples were collected 1day per week from July 2015 to August 2016, and physicochemical parameters (pH, turbidity, conductivity, and residual free chlorine) were measured. Presence of Hpylori DNA was determined and quantified by quantitative polymerase chain reaction (qPCR). Fecal indicator bacteria (total coliforms, Escherichia coli, and spores of sulfite-reducing Clostridia) were enumerated by using standard culture techniques. ResultsThirty of 155 (31%) raw water samples and forty-eight of 155 (38.7%) drinking water samples were positive for the presence of Hpylori. No statistically significant relationships were found between physicochemical parameters or FIB with the presence or absence of Hpylori in any sample (P<0.05). ConclusionsThis study provides evidence of the presence of Hpylori DNA in raw and drinking water in Bogota, and shows that the detection and enumeration of FIB and physicochemical parameters in water do not correlate with the risk of contamination with Hpylori.",Article,"Vesga, F.J.; Moreno, Y.; Ferrus, M.A.; Ledesma-Gaitan, L.M.; Campos, C.; Trespalacios, A.A.",drinking water; fecal indicator bacteria; Helicobacter pylori; physicochemical parameters; qPCR; raw water,drinking water;fecal indicator bacteria;Helicobacter pylori;physicochemical parameters;qPCR;raw water;QUALITY;PATHOGENS;PCR;CONTAMINATION;INFECTION;SURVIVAL;SEWAGE;IMPACT;RIVER,Colombia;Spain,2-s2.0-85063884721

Design/methodology - We use the comparative case studies method to draw on the common features among the seven in-debt cases we built. We are well aware that the method of comparative case studies does not provide a sufficient base for bold generalizations. However, the qualitative approach adopted here allows for the first in-depth look at the strategies that bring surviving entrepreneurs from explosive growth to a more balanced growth path. Findings - We identify four organizational capabilities as key to the survival of these businesses ten years later: first, ability to prioritize product and market development, including internationalization, over operations; second, ability to reorganize internally and delegate in a timely manner; third, ability to manage innovation and support creativity linked to productivity; and finally, ability to manage economic and financial resources.

So far, no study has examined the impact of public social spending during the recent economic recession on health, and social inequalities in health among young people. This study investigates whether an increase in public spending relates to a lower prevalence in health complaints and buffers health inequalities among adolescents. Methods: Data were obtained from the 2009/2010 ""Health Behaviour in School-aged Children (HBSC)"" study comprising 11 - 15-year-old adolescents from 27 European countries (N = 144,754). Socioeconomic position was measured by the Family Affluence Scale (FAS). Logistic multilevel models were conducted for the association between the absolute rate of public spending on family benefits per capita in 2010 and the relative change rate in family benefits (2006-2010) in relation to adolescent psychological health complaints in 2009/2010. Results: The absolute rate of public spending on family benefits in 2010 did not show a significant association with adolescents' psychological health complaints. Relative change rates of public spending on family benefits (2006-2010) were related to better health. Greater socioeconomic inequalities in psychological health complaints were found for countries with higher change rates in public spending on family benefits (2006-2010). Conclusions: The results partially support our hypothesis and highlight that policy initiatives in terms of an increase in family benefits might partially benefit adolescent health, but tend to widen social inequalities in adolescent health during the recent recession.",Article,"Rathmann, K.; Pfortner, T.K.; Osorio, A.M.; Hurrelmann, K.; Elgar, F.J.; Bosakova, L.; Richter, M.",Health inequalities; Recession; Social spending; Adolescence; Multilevel analysis,Health inequalities;Recession;Social spending;Adolescence;Multilevel analysis;FAMILY AFFLUENCE SCALE;MENTAL-HEALTH;CRISIS;COMPLAINTS;EUROPE;MULTILEVEL;COUNTRIES;CHILDREN;IMPACT;RISE,Germany;Colombia;Canada;Slovakia;Czech Republic,2-s2.0-84983262115
,,,5,WOS:000664151200003,2021,Coastal erosion risk assessment in the dynamic estuary: The Meghna estuary case of Bangladesh coast,"Erosion is one of the predominant hazards in coastal Bangladesh. For implementing effective adaptation and mitigation strategies, assessment of risk to coastal erosion is crucial. This study aimed to assess the levels of risk to coastal erosion in the Meghna estuary, a major erosion-prone area in the coastal region of the country impacted by abrupt changes in hydrological and geomorphological conditions. Using physical, environmental, and socio-economic geospatial data, this is the first attempt in assessing erosion risk and characterizing three main risk components: hazard, vulnerability, and exposure at a regional extent in the estuary. A total of 19 indicators were considered, and statistical methods assisted with the Analytic Hierarchy Process (AHP) were used for the construction of hazard, vulnerability, and exposure indices, which were then integrated to calculate erosion risk comprehensively at the lowermost administrative unit (union) level throughout the study area. The results of hazard and vulnerability analyses depicted 35.72% and 46.69% areas as highly hazard-prone and highly vulnerable to erosion, respectively. Assessment of the exposure index exhibited 42.25% area as highly exposed to coastal erosion in the estuary. Finally, the results quantified different levels of risk as very high (14.91%), high (19.36%), moderate (23.40%), low (23.91%), and very low (18.41%). Among 161 coastal unions, 45 unions were identified as high to very high erosion risk-prone areas, located in the coasts of Bhola, Noakhali, and Barishal districts including their major islands. The validation result confirmed a reasonable level of acceptance of the calculated risk map, despite several data limitations.

,,,5,WOS:000300905500003,2011,Demography of the clonal palm Prestoea acuminata in the Colombian Andes: sustainable household extraction of palm hearts,"Prestoea acuminata is a highland clonal palm traditionally used as a source of palm hearts by the Awa Indians of Colombia and Ecuador; its commercial use thrived in the 1980's. Extraction pressure on the resource is particularly strong during Holy Week, as campesinos use it as a substitute for meat. We studied P. acuminata demography at La Planada Reserve, southwestern Colombia, and elaborated a ramet-based matrix model to assess the impact of different palm heart harvest regimes. The 1.5 ha study area had 1182 genets, composed of 5389 ramets. Harvestable stems were 23-40 years old and accounted for 0.32% of the stable stage distribution (SSD). Ramet population asymptotic growth rate lambda was 1.0485, and was more sensitive to changes in the survival of stemless ramets. Observed stage distribution (OSD) differed from predicted SSD, which suggests the population was exhibiting transient dynamics. As our census was conducted four years after a severe ENSO, we argue that the OSD could be reflecting this environmental disturbance. Thus, harvest simulations must be interpreted with caution. Although P. acuminata ramets are abundant at La Planada, the typical genet architecture, with many stemless ramets (approximate to 20) and only 1-2 stems appropriate for palm heart extraction, accounts for a very low resource yield (127 palm hearts ha(-1) in our survey). This, and its slow growth rate, make P. acuminata suitable only for household extraction. As harvest has a strong effect on sexual recruitment, we recommend a maximum annual extraction of 10% of harvestable ramets.",Article,"Gamba-Trimino, C.; Bernal, R.; Bittner, J.",Arecaceae; La Planada; Matrix Projection,Arecaceae;La Planada;Matrix Projection;DIVISION-OF-LABOR;POPULATION-GROWTH;ATLANTIC FOREST;TROPICAL PALM;MODELS;IMPACT;DYNAMICS;HARVEST;REPRODUCTION,Colombia,2-s2.0-84856826517
,,,5,WOS:000475649600004,2019,Distributional health and financial benefits of increased tobacco taxes in Colombia: results from a modelling study,"Background In Colombia, smoking is the second leading modifiable risk factor for premature mortality. In December 2016, Colombia passed a major tax increase on tobacco products in an effort to decrease smoking and improve population health. While tobacco taxes are known to be highly effective in reducing the prevalence of smoking, they are often criticised as being regressive in consumption. This analysis attempts to assess the distributional impact (across socioeconomic groups) of the new tax on selected health and financial outcomes. Methods This study builds on extended cost-effectiveness analysis methods to study the new tobacco tax in Colombia, and estimates, over a time period of 20 years and across income quintiles of the current urban population (80% of the country population), the years of life gained with smoking cessation and the increased tax revenues, all associated with a 70% relative price increase of the pack of cigarettes. Where possible, we use parameters that vary by income quintile, including price elasticity of demand for cigarettes (average of -0.44 estimated from household survey data). Findings Over 20 years, the tax increase would lead to an estimated 191000 years of life gained among Colombia's current urban population, with the largest gains among the bottom two income quintiles. The additional annual tax revenues raised would amount to about 2%-4% of Colombia's annual government health expenditure, with the poorest quintiles bearing the smallest tax burden increase. Conclusions The tobacco tax increase passed by Colombia has substantial implications for the country's population health and financial well-being, with large benefits likely to accrue to the two poorest quintiles of the population.",Article,"James, E.K.; Saxena, A.; Restrepo, C.F.; Llorente, B.; Vecino-Ortiz, A.I.; Uribe, M.V.; Iunes, R.F.; Verguet, S.",,EXCISE TAX;SMOKING;SMOKERS;CONSEQUENCES;IMPACT;PRICE,United States;Colombia,2-s2.0-85052540725;2-s2.0-85052533043;2-s2.0-85052540725;2-s2.0-85052533043

Therefore, this study aimed to characterise impact of high income countries (HIC) versus low and middle income countries (LMIC) on the outcomes following esophagectomy for esophageal cancer. Method: This international multi-center prospective study across 137 hospitals in 41 countries included patients who underwent an esophagectomy for esophageal cancer, with 90-day follow-up. The main explanatory variable was country income, defined according to the World Bank Data classification. The primary outcome was 90-day postoperative mortality, and secondary outcomes were composite leaks (anastomotic leak or conduit necrosis) and major complications (Clavien-Dindo Grade III-V). Multivariable generalized estimating equation models were used to produce adjusted odds ratios (ORs) and 95% confidence intervals (CI95%). Results: Between April 2018 to December 2018, 2247 patients were included. Patients from HIC were more significantly older, with higher ASA grade, and more advanced tumors. Patients from LMIC had almost three-fold increase in 90-day mortality, compared to HIC (9.4% vs 3.7%, p < 0.001). On adjusted analysis, LMIC were independently associated with higher 90-day mortality (OR: 2.31, CI95%: 1.17-4.55, p = 0.015). However, LMIC were not independently associated with higher rates of anastomotic leaks (OR: 1.06, CI95%: 0.57-1.99, p = 0.9) or major complications (OR: 0.85, CI95%: 0.54-1.32, p = 0.5), compared to HIC. Conclusion: Resections in LMIC were independently associated with higher 90-day postoperative mortality, likely reflecting a failure to rescue of these patients following esophagectomy, despite similar composite anastomotic leaks and major complication rates to HIC. These findings warrant further research, to identify potential issues and solutions to improve global outcomes following esophagectomy for cancer.

Aim: To determine the frequency of screening for risk of malnutrition in medical records and assess the usefulness of the Malnutrition Screening Tool (MST). Material and Methods: In a cross-sectional study, we searched for malnutrition screening in medical records, and we applied the MST tool to hospitalized patients at the Internal Medicine Wards of San Ignacio University Hospital. Results: Of 295 patients included, none had been screened for malnutrition since hospital admission. Sixty one percent were at nutritional risk, with a higher prevalence among patients with HIV (85.7%), cancer (77.5%) and pneumonia. A positive MST result was associated with a 3.2 days increase in length of hospital stay (p = 0.024). Conclusions: The prevalence of malnutrition risk in hospitalized patients is high, but its screening is inadequate and it is underdiagnosed.

A text mining analysis, using Leximancer 4.5 software, of the most influential SE research studies was conducted to identify themes and trace changes over time. Our literature search process produced 101 articles, which were used in the analysis. The analysis was conducted over three time periods corresponding to three different phases of SE research. The nascent phase covers 1990-2002; the growth phase covers 2003-2010, and the maturity phase covers 2011-2018. This temporal analysis reveals that different themes emerged at the different phases. The dominant theme in the first phase focused on the social entrepreneur (individual level). The second phase focused heavily on the organisational level of SE and the third phase focused on institutional and contextual dimensions of social entrepreneurship. Overall, our analysis revealed four dominant themes in SE, namely (1) social entrepreneurs, individuals and communities (2) organisation of SE (3) innovation and value creation in SE, and (4) context of social entrepreneurship.

Methods: In this work, we developed 3D multicellular spheroid (3D-MS) for the study of human hematopoietic stem cells (HSCs) with some components of perivascular niche. HSCs were isolated from umbilical cord blood, MSCs were isolated from human bone marrow and a microvasculature EC line (CC-2811, Lonza (R)) was used. For the formation of a 3D structure, a magnetic levitation culture system was used. Cultures were maintained in 21%, 3% and 1% O-2 for 15 days. Culture volume, sphericity index and cell viability were determined. Also, human HSC proliferation, phenotype and production of reactive oxygen species were evaluated. Results: After 15 days, 3D-MS exhibited viability greater than 80%. Histology results showed structures without necrotic centers, and higher cellular proliferation with 3% O2. An increase in the expression of the CD34 antigen and other hematopoietic antigens were observed to 1% O-2 with MSCs plus ECs and low ROS levels. Conclusion: These findings suggest that 3D-MS formed by MSCs, ECs and HSCs exposed to low concentrations of oxygen (1-3% O-2) modulate human HSC behavior and mimics some features of the perivascular niche, which could reduce the use of animal models and deepen the relationship between the microenvironment of HSC and human hematological diseases development.",Article,"Barreto-Duran, E.; Mejia-Cruz, C.C.; Jaramillo-Garcia, L.F.; Leal-Garcia, E.; Barreto-Prieto, A.; Rodriguez-Pardo, V.M.",hematopoietic stem cells; niche; bone marrow; microenvironment; 3D culture,hematopoietic stem cells;niche;bone marrow;microenvironment;3D culture;BONE-MARROW;SELF-RENEWAL;PDGFR-ALPHA;EXPRESSION;NICHES;LIVE;DIFFERENTIATION;PROGENITORS;HYPOXIA;IMPACT,Colombia,2-s2.0-85109959129

Methods: International Nosocomial Infection Control Consortium (INICC) members conducted a prospective, surveillance study on PIVCR BSIs from January 2010 to March 2018 in 100 intensive care units (ICUs) among 41 hospitals, in 26 cities of 9 countries in Latin America (Argentina, Brazil, Colombia, Costa Rica, Dominican-Republic, Ecuador, Mexico, Panama, and Venezuela). The Centers for Disease Control and Prevention (CDC) National Health Safety Network (NHSN) definitions were applied, and INICC methodology and INICC Surveillance Online System software were used. Results: In total, 10,120 ICU patients were followed for 40,078 bed days and 38,262 PVC days. In addition, 79 PIVCR BSIs were identified, with a rate of 2.06 per 1,000 PVC days (95% confidence interval [CI], 1.635-2.257). The average length of stay (ALOS) of patients without a PIVCR BSI was 3.95 days, and the ALOS was 5.29 days for patients with a PIVCR BSI. The crude extra ALOS was 1.34 days (RR, 1.33; 95% CI, 1.0975-1.6351; P = .040). The mortality rate in patients without PIVCR BSI was 3.67%, and this rate was 6.33% in patients with a PIVCR BSI.

However, conspicuous consumption often does not represent social and environmental values, because their products are often not characterized by being made through sustainable processes. United Nations, through its sustainable development agenda, invited companies to be aware of the social and environmental problems of the world and to be able to generate strategies that can be sustainable over time and allow the growth of both the company and society in general. This study analyses the case of Starbucks as a global and sustainable brand, which also generates conspicuous consumption in emerging markets. In this way, we explain how this brand generates a social status in emerging markets, which allow their consumers to excel socially. On the other hand, we explain how Starbucks contributes positively to sustainability in these types of markets, generating greater well-being for both the environment and society in general. In this way, this brand manages to transmit messages with symbolic values of social status, as well as social and environmental awareness. This research allows us to see how Starbucks is able to generate conspicuous consumption in Colombia, which is the third largest exporter of coffee in the world but is also capable of generating sustainable processes that help Colombian coffee growers and the environment. This research used a quantitative methodology based on a structured questionnaire made for conspicuous consumers of the Starbucks brand in Colombia, whose data were processed through the statistical program PLS 3.2.7. This research details the sustainable processes carried out by this brand in this developing country and the reasons why its consumption in this emerging market is considered conspicuous.

The sample consisted of 751 workers from Colombian organizations. It was found that sharing explicit and tacit knowledge correlated with the cultural dimensions of uncertainty avoidance, individualism-collectivism, and paternalism. On the other side, sharing tacit and explicit knowledge did not correlate with the cultural dimensions of power distance and masculinity-femininity. For organizational managers interested in knowledge sharing, a lesson is to facilitate environments of low uncertainty, care about the needs of workers, and have high collective values such as respect and interest in what others do. These values are essential for the promotion of knowledge sharing, which in turn contributes to sustainable organizations.

Methods This is an expert opinion based on two retrospective studies. Here we examine the recent subset analysis of relevant data from the IDMPS Wave 7 (International Diabetes Management-Practices Study, 2015-2016) and the GOAL study conducted in multiple LMICs. Results Wave 7 sub-analysis was performed in 6113 people with type 2 diabetes from 24 LMIC. Poorly controlled diabetes (hemogloblin A1c [HbA1c] >= 7%) was found in 58.6, 73.0 and 78.3% of participants with diabetes duration of < 5, 5-12 and > 12 years, respectively (in association with a high prevalence of macro- and microvascular complications). Moreover, 37.7% of participants with diabetes duration of 5-12 years were treated only with oral antihyperglycemic drugs. The GOAL study investigated the efficacy of insulin in 2704 poorly controlled participants (mean HbA1c 9.7%; diabetes duration 10.1 +/- 6.7 years; 10 LMIC). A significant 2% reduction in mean HbA1c levels was observed after 12 months of treatment. Only 7.2% of participants experienced a symptomatic episode of hypoglycemia (nocturnal or severe hypoglycemia events were infrequent). Conclusion The rate of well-controlled participants (HbA1c < 7.0%) in the Wave 7 sub-analysis was lower than that observed in the USA (NHANES survey) or in European countries (GUIDANCE study), and the incidence of microvascular complications was higher.

A Meta-Analysis,"Simple Summary Breast cancer (BC) is the second largest cause of death for cancer in women worldwide. Different studies have shown that the androgen receptor (AR), a cytoplasmic ligand-dependent transcription factor, may play a role as a marker of BC biology. We aimed to assess the clinical significance of AR gene expression in BC by meta-analysis of large-scale microarray transcriptomic datasets. Our findings suggest that high mRNA levels of AR have the potential to be a promising non-invasive prognostic biomarker for the identification of the less aggressive BC subtypes. The androgen receptor (AR) is frequently expressed in breast cancer (BC), but its association with clinical and biological parameters of BC patients remains unclear. Here, we investigated the association of AR gene expression according to intrinsic BC subtypes by meta-analysis of large-scale microarray transcriptomic datasets. Sixty-two datasets including 10315 BC patients were used in the meta-analyses. Interestingly, AR mRNA level is significantly increased in patients categorized with less aggressive intrinsic molecular subtypes including, Luminal A compared to Basal-like (standardized mean difference, SMD: 2.12; 95% confidence interval, CI: 1.88 to 2.35; p < 0.001) or when comparing Luminal B to Basal-like (SMD: 1.53; CI: 1.33 to 1.72; p < 0.001). The same trend was observed when analyses were performed using immunohistochemistry-based surrogate subtypes. Consistently, the AR mRNA expression was higher in patients with low histological grade (p < 0.001). Furthermore, our data revealed higher levels of AR mRNA in BC patients expressing either estrogen or progesterone receptors (p < 0.001). Together, our findings indicate that high mRNA levels of AR are associated with BC subgroups with the less aggressive clinical features.",Review,"Cruz-Tapias, P.; Rubiano, W.; Rondon-Lagos, M.; Villegas, V.E.; Rangel, N.",androgen receptor; intrinsic subtypes; breast cancer; meta-analysis,androgen receptor;intrinsic subtypes;breast cancer;meta-analysis;PROGNOSTIC-SIGNIFICANCE;TUMOR-SUPPRESSOR;ESTROGEN;GROWTH;CELLS;ENZALUTAMIDE;OUTCOMES;THERAPY;IMPACT,Colombia,2-s2.0-85114316221;2-s2.0-85114316221

Herein, we describe the bibliometrics and impact of the 200 most-cited pediatric renal transplantation manuscripts. Methods We identified pediatric renal transplantation publications from 1900 onwards. Year, citations, h-index, geographic origin, impact factor, topic, and design of the 200 top-cited papers were extracted. Impact index was calculated, adjusting for citation volume and time since publication. Results Of the top 200 papers, mean citation count was 80 +/- 40, impact factor 3.9 +/- 3.7, h-index 35 +/- 20, and impact index 25 +/- 13. Studies were mostly retrospective (31%) or observational (32%). Most papers originated from the United States (58%), Germany (9%), and Italy (6%), which did not correlate with citation counts. Transplantation (18%), Pediatric Nephrology (16%), and American Journal of Transplantation (11%) had the highest publication volume, which did not correlate with citation count. The main topics were medical renal disease, drug monitoring, compliance, and viruses. Most of the top-cited papers (179; 90%) were published after 1991. The difference in the number of times cited between papers published before and after 1991 was insignificant (75 +/- 24 vs 80 +/- 42; P = 0.59). There was a difference in impact index for the same period (48 +/- 15 vs 22 +/- 10; P < 0.01).

Evidence from Costa Rica,"The estimated benefits of malaria eradication have been very different in terms of human capital accumulation. This paper quantifies the impact of malaria eradication in Costa Rica and explores whether precampaign regional characteristics can improve or damage the benefits of a health campaign. There are several results. First, using difference in differences I find that years of education of men and women increased in response to the eradication campaign but that only wages of males increased. Results are robust. Second, worse conditions in the school system and more child employment displaced schooling. Hence, health benefits may not translate into educational gains when the school system characteristics are bad or when the child labor market provides a better investment opportunity than schooling. Third, combining empirical evidence with a simple model, the increase in schooling cannot solely explain the increase in the income of men; however, health improvements explain most of the increase. Finally, the point estimates show that human capital gains were almost completely eliminated when a shortage of funding for eradication led to a resurgence of malaria; this emphasizes the fragility of the estimated benefits.",Article,"Mora-Garcia, C.A.",,SOUTH-AFRICA;EXPOSURE;IMPACT;CHILDHOOD;EDUCATION;DISEASE;GENDER;HEALTH;LABOR,Colombia,2-s2.0-85043531092;2-s2.0-85043531092

Health complications of FGM occur immediately and over time, and are associated with healthcare costs that are poorly understood. Quantifying the global FGM-related burden is essential for supporting programmes and policies for prevention and mitigation. Methods Health complications of FGM are derived from a meta-analysis and stratified by acute, uro-gynaecological, obstetric and psychological/sexual. Treatment costs are calculated from national cohort models of 27 high-burden countries over 30 years. Savings associated with full/partial abandonment are compared with a current incidence reference scenario, assuming no changes in FGM practices. Results Our model projects an increasing burden of FGM due to population growth. As a reference scenario assuming no change in practices, prevalent cases in 27 countries will rise from 119.4 million (2018) to 205.8 million (2047). Full abandonment could reduce this to 80.0 million (2047), while partial abandonment is insufficient to reduce cases. Current incidence economic burden is US$1.4 billion/year, rising to US$2.1 billion/year in 2047. Full abandonment would reduce the future burden to US$0.8 billion/year by 2047. Conclusion FGM is a human rights violation, a public health issue and a substantial economic burden that can be avoided through effective prevention strategies. While decreasing trends are observed in some countries, these trends are variable and not consistently observed across settings. Additional resources are needed to prevent FGM to avoid human suffering and growing costs.

The data were collected from exporting firms characterized by beginning international operations in the first three years and were thus classified as Born Global. A panel Dynamic Structural Equation Model (DSEM) was used to test the research hypothesis. One of the methodological contributions is the exploration of dynamic social behaviors that are difficult to study, specifically over time. Here, DSEM becomes in a data analysis technique that allows us to analyze this type of phenomena. The research results show that the relationship between Ambidextrous learning (AL) and Corporate Sustainability (CS) is positive in the short- and long-term. The cultural dimension's Power Distance and Uncertainty Avoidance moderates the relation between (AL) and (CS) and this dimension can predict their inertia.

Nonetheless, a general assessment of the lakes' distribution and biogeochemical characteristics was lacking. We made a complete inventory of the Colombian paramo lakes and characterized their morphometry and water chemistry based on a survey of 51 lakes in the Eastern Cordillera. There are 3250 lakes distributed across 28 paramo complexes in Colombia, mainly located between 3600 and 4400 m a.s.l. The lakes are usually small (<10 ha) and shallow (<10 m). Most of them are slightly acidic (average pH similar to 6), with high nutrient (total phosphorus similar to 0.6 mg/L, total nitrogen similar to 1 mg/L) and total organic carbon (similar to 6 mg/L) concentrations and low oxygen (similar to 3.5 mg/L) at the bottom.

Family members are often caregivers for individuals with traumatic brain injury, which can result in significant stress. Research is needed to examine depression and quality of the caregiving relationship in these dyads. This study examined relationship quality and depression longitudinally after traumatic brain injury within the caregiving relationship. Design Dyads (N= 109) composed of individuals with traumatic brain injury and their caregivers were recruited from three hospitals in Mexico and Colombia. They self-reported depression and relationship satisfaction during hospitalization and at 2 and 4 mos after hospitalization. Results A 2-lag Actor Partner Interdependence Model demonstrated that patients and caregivers reporting high relationship satisfaction at baseline experienced lower depression 2 mos later, which then predicted higher caregiver relationship satisfaction at 4 mos. Moreover, patients with high relationship satisfaction at baseline had caregivers with lower depression at 2 mos, which was then associated with patients' higher satisfaction at 4 mos. Conclusions Within individuals with traumatic brain injury and caregivers, depression and relationship satisfaction seem to be inversely related.

,,,2,WOS:000297485500057,2011,Significance of Cytomegalovirus Prophylaxis Strategies and Development of Cancer in Kidney Transplant Recipients,"Cytomegalovirus (CMV) infection is one of the most common complications among kidney transplant recipients; two approaches preventing this complication are currently available: universal prophylaxis (UP) and pre-emptive therapy (PT). Despite some differences, similar effectiveness and safety have been proven in several studies for both strategies. However, Spinner et al compared both treatments in 115 renal transplant recipients showing deaths were more likely to occur in patients who received UP. Most of these deaths (2/4 cases) occurred because malignancies developed. This finding is paradoxical because CMV is considered a potentially oncogenic virus and, therefore, UP (a longer therapy compared with the PT) should not be linked with the emergence of a greater number of tumors. New evidence suggests that changes in host immune response triggered by CMV infection may have a mitigating effect on the development of tumors. It is now known CMV infection produces a clonal expansion of gamma delta T lymphocytes which can elicit an aggressive response against neoplastic cells. Currently, UP is the therapy most frequently used in Colombian transplant centers; however, doses administered vary depending on several clinical and laboratory factors. There are no clinical cohorts treated with PT. Reviewing the impact of different length dosing schemes is important for creating an immune response affecting malignancy development in kidney transplant recipients.",Article; Proceedings Paper,"Osorio, J.C.; Medina, R.D.; Patino, N.; Ricaurte, L.; Moreno, L.; Lozano, E.",,DELTA T-CELLS;ORAL VALGANCICLOVIR;INFECTION;PREVENTION;MANAGEMENT;OUTCOMES;THERAPY;IMPACT,Colombia,2-s2.0-81455139511

We evaluated four cylindrical bottles with different color caps (red, black, blue, and white). Results show that using a blue cap generates substantial positive changes in preference. The goal of the second experiment was to isolate the effect of bottle shape. Of the three bottle forms (cylindrical, squared, and anthropomorphic), the anthropomorphic was preferred. Results show that using a blue cap or an anthropomorphic shape improves preference and quality perceptions. A third experiment compared four price gaps (same price, 5%, 10%, and 20%) for the best versus worst shape and/color combination.

In this study of community-living older adults, our objective was to quantify outcome changes following identification and treatment of malnutrition or its risk. Design: Our intervention was a nutritional quality improvement program (QIP). The nutritional QIP included: (i) education of participants about the importance of complete and balanced macro- and micronutrient intake plus physical exercise, (ii) nutritional intervention with dietary counseling; and (iii) provision of oral nutritional supplements (ONS) for daily intake over 60 days. Follow-up measurements took place 30 days after ONS treatment ended, i.e., 90 days after start of intervention. Setting and participants: We recruited 618 transitional-care, chronically ill, older adults ( 60 years) with malnutrition/risk (per Mini Nutrition Assessment-Short Form, MNA-SF) from the outpatient clinic of Hospital Universitario San Ignacio, in Bogota???, Colombia. Methods: For pre-post comparisons, we examined cognition (Mini-Mental State Exam, MMSE), physical abilities (Barthel Activities of Daily Living, ADL; Short Physical Performance Battery, SPPB), affective disorder status (Global Depression Scale, GDS), and quality of life (QoL; EuroQoL-5D-3L, EQ-5D-3L; EuroQoL-Visual Analog Scale, EQ-VAS).

A significant number of studies have compared the mortality of patients who require RRT versus those who do not require it, finding an increase in mortality rates in the short and medium term; however, few studies have evaluated the long-term survival in a mixture of patients admitted to the ICU. Objective To evaluate the impact of RRT on 5-year survival in patients with AKI admitted to the ICU Methods Using administrative databases of insurers of the Colombian health system, a cohort of patients admitted to the ICU between 1 January 2012 and 31 December 2013 was followed until 31 December 2018. ICD-10 diagnoses, procedure codes, and prescribed medications were used to establish the frequencies of the comorbidities included in the Charlson index. Patients were followed for at least 5 years to evaluate survival and establish the adjusted risks by propensity score matching. Results Of the 150,230 patients admitted to the ICU, 4366 (2.9%) required RRT in the ICU. Mortality rates for patients with RRT vs no RRT evaluated at ICU discharge, 1 year, and 5 years were 35%, 57.4%, and 67.9% vs 7.4%, 17.6%, and 30.1%, respectively. After propensity score matching, the hazard ratio was calculated for patients who received RRT and those who did not (HR, 2.46; 95% CI 2.37 to 2.56;p< 0.001), with a lower difference in years of survival for patients with RRT (mean effect in the treated) of - 1.86 (95% CI - 2.01 to to1.65;p< 0.001).

However, there is limited evidence in older adults with DM1 and DM2. Methods: A retrospective cohort study was conducted in patients >= 60 years-old with DM1 and DM2, who started Sensor Augmented Insulin Pump therapy with low-glucose suspend feature (SAP + LGS) at Hospital Universitario San Ignacio diabetes center in Bogota, Colombia. Patients were evaluated between 2009 and 2019 and were treated with Paradigm VEO or Medtronic MiniMed 640 insulin pumps and continuous glucose monitoring system. Glycated hemoglobin (A1c), severe hypoglycemia and hypoglycemia unawareness were assessed at least every 3 months, and hospitalizations and ketoacidosis episodes incidence were assessed yearly. Results: 36 patients were analyzed, (67.36 +/- 4.88 years-old) (body mass index 25.48 +/- 4.61 kg/m2). The most common indications for starting SAP + LGS were hypoglycemia (58.3%), high glycemic variability (25.0%) and poor metabolic control (16.7%). 26 patients used VEO (72.2%) whereas 27.8% started 640 insulin pump. Data from 32 participants showed A1c decreased from 8.57 +/- 1.73% to 7.42 +/- 0.96 after a year of therapy (Mean difference -1.15%, p < 0.05); 28.12% reached A1c levels <7% and 42.85% < 7.5%. There was a significant decrease in the proportion of patients with at least one severe hypoglycemia (56.7 vs 3.3%), one or more hospitalizations (20 vs 3.3%), and hypoglycemia unawareness after the first year of follow-up (p < 0.05). Conclusions: These results suggest that SAP + LGS is safe and effective in people 60 years or older after one year of therapy. Future randomized clinical trials are needed in the elderly.

Method: ology: This is a multicentric prospective real-life study performed in Colombia, Chile and Spain. Patients with T1D treated with PLGM-SAPT, using sensor >= 70% of time, were included. Data regarding pump and sensor use patterns and carbohydrate intake from 28 consecutive days were collected. A bivariate and multivariate Poisson regression analysis was carried out, to evaluate the association between the number of events of <54 mg/dl with the clinical variables and patterns of sensor and pump use. Results: 188 subjects were included (41 +/- 13.8 years-old, 23 +/- 12 years disease duration, A1c 7.2% +/- 0.9). The median of events <54 mg/dl was four events/patient/month (IQR 1-10), 77% of these events occurred during day time. Multivariate analysis showed that the number of events of hypoglycemia were higher in patients with previous severe hypoglycemia (IRR1.38; 95% CI 1.19-1.61; p 0.001), high glycemic variability defined as Coefficient of Variation (CV%) 0.001) and hypoglycemia unawareness. A protector effect was identified for adequate sensor calibration (IRR 0.77; 95%CI 0.66-0.90; p:0.001), and the use of bolus wizard 60% (IRR 0.74; 95%CI 0.58-0.95; p:0.017). Conclusion: In spite of using advanced SAPT, clinically significant hypoglycemia is still a non-negligible risk. Only the identification and intervention of modifiable factors could help to prevent and reduce hypoglycemia in clinical practice (C) 2021 Diabetes India. Published by Elsevier Ltd.

Motorcyclists are the most vulnerable road users worldwide to road safety (28% of global fatalities), together with cyclists and pedestrians. Approximately 80% of deaths are from low- or middle-income countries. Colombia has a rate of 9.7 deaths per 100 000 inhabitants, which places it 10th in the world. Motorcycles in Colombia correspond to 57% of the fleet and generate an average of 51% of fatalities per year. This study aims to identify significant factors of the environment, traffic volume, and infrastructure to predict the number of accidents per year focused only on motorcyclists. The prediction model used a negative binomial regression for the definition of a Safety Performance Function (SPF) for motorcyclists. In the second stage, Bayes' empirical approach is implemented to identify motorcycle crash-prone road sections. The study is applied in Cartagena, one of the capital cities with more traffic crashes and motorcyclists dedicated to informal transportation (motorcycle taxi riders) in Colombia. The data of 2884 motorcycle crashes between 2016 and 2017 are analyzed. The proposed model identifies that crashes of motorcyclists per kilometer have significant factors such as the average volume of daily motorcyclist traffic, the number of accesses (intersections) per kilometer, commercial areas, and the type of road and it identifies 55 critical accident-prone sections.

However, in most cases, large-scale measures failed to be implemented and the transmission of MRSA has since led to a global pandemic. Presently, doubts still remain about the best approach to prevent and control M RSA and more often than not, control measures are not implemented. Therefore, we review here the current situation in Latin America with respect to existing policies for control of M RSA, and evaluate the evidence for control measures in hospitals and the community. We look at the risk factors for infection and transmission of MRSA between hospital patients and within specific populations in the community, and at the effect of antibiotic usage on the spread of MRSA in these settings.

For this reason, the significance of this topic has encouraged scientists to investigate the main factors that play a part in the development and application of successful export strategies. This article analyses the export success of Colombian businesses from the behaviour of variables at the business and sectoral levels. The research aims to characterise the relevant conditions affecting the entry of small and medium-sized enterprises (SMEs) into the foreign market, which can be useful for business owners who are in the process of internationalisation; they can also be considered as an instrument for developing policies promoting exports from Colombia. A multilevel model is estimated for a sample of Colombian businesses. We examined international experience, export commitment and export strategy as business factors that positively influence export success, as well as export assistance programmes, networks, tariff legislation, sector size and innovation as sectoral factors. It was concluded that the export destination, the country's conditions and regulations should be examined before the beginning of the export process.

However, obtaining average values are more straightforward than the high temporal resolution information necessary to catch the extreme events on those tails. Such information is difficult to get in areas lacking sufficient rain stations. Thanks to the development of Satellite Precipitation Estimates with a daily resolution, this problem has been overcome, so Extreme Precipitation Indices (EPI) can be calculated for the entire Colombian territory. However, Colombia is strongly affected by the ENSO (El Nino-Southern Oscillation) phenomenon. Therefore, it is pertinent to ask if the EPI's long-term change due to climate change is more critical than the anomalies due to climate variability induced by the warm and cold phases of ENSO (El Nino and La Nina, respectively). In this work, we built EPI annual time series at each grid-point of the selected Satellite Precipitation Estimate (CHIRPSv2) over Colombia to answer the previous question. Then, the Mann-Whitney-Wilcoxon test was used to compare the samples drawn in each case (i.e., change tests due to both long-term and climatic variability). After performing the analyses, we realized that the importance of the change depends on the region analyzed and the considered EPI. However, some general conclusions became evident: during El Nino years (La Nina), EPI's anomaly follows the general trend of reduction -drier conditions- (increase; -wetter conditions-) observed in Colombian annual precipitation amount, but only on the Pacific, the Caribbean, and the Andean region. In the Eastern plains of Colombia (Orinoquia and Amazonian region), EPI show a certain insensitivity to change due to climatic variability. On the other hand, EPI's long-term changes in the Pacific, the Caribbean, and the Andean region are spatially scattered.

Design We conducted a multicentre cross-sectional study to collect physical activity and built environment data. The levels of physical activity were calculated through the International Physical Activity Questionnaire survey. Using the Neighbourhood Environment Walkability Scale-Abbreviated, characteristics of the built environment were measured through three domains: accessibility, microinfrastructure and security. To estimate the association of the built environment and physical activity, we used mixed effects logistic regression analysis. In addition, likelihood ratio test to account for clustered effect within countries and/or cities was used. Setting Eight countries in LA. Participants Adults aged 15-65 years (n=9218) living in urban areas and consented to participate of the Latin American Study of Nutrition and Health. Results Most of the population in LA had access to a grocery store (97.2%), public transport stop (91.5%) and children's playground (81.6%). Metropolitan parks were more accessible in Ecuador (59.8%) and Colombia (59.2%) than in Venezuela (33.5%). Individuals located within 20 min of walking from sport facilities or children's playground areas were more likely to perform moderate-to-high physical activity OR 1.20 (95% CI 1.06 to 1.36) and OR 1.25 (95% CI 1.02 to 1.53), respectively. Only 14.5% of the population from the region considered that their neighbourhood had an adequate design for walking or cycling.

This study aimed to assess, in a population of patients with DM2, discharged from a tertiary referral hospital, whether treatment based on the use of an mHealth application was associated with better glycemic control at the 3-month follow-up, than standard care. Methods: This open, randomized, controlled clinical trial included adult DM2 patients who were transitioning from inpatient to outpatient care. The efficacy and safety of patient management with and without mHealth was compared at the 3-month follow-up. The primary outcome was the change in the Glycosylated hemoglobin (HbA1c) levels. The secondary outcomes were the rates of hypoglycemic and hyperglycemic events and treatment satisfaction measured using the Insulin Treatment Satisfaction Questionnaire (ITSQ). Results: In total, 86 patients (41 using mHealth) were included in the clinical trial. HbA1c levels showed a significant decrease in both groups. The mean HbA1c level was significantly lower in the mHealth group. Patients using mHealth showed decreased incidence rate ratios of hypoglycemia 3.0 mmol/L [<54 mg/dl], hypoglycemia ranging from 3.0 to 3.8 mmol/L [54 to 70 mg/dl] and severe hypoglycemia.

The acute cellular rejection is recognized as a factor related to the long-term viability of the heart graft. We intend to establish which factors are associated with the acute cellular rejection during the first year post heart transplant using a longitudinal model with repeated measures. Methods. A retrospective cohort study was performed with all the patients who underwent heart transplant between 2005-2018 at the Hospital Universitario San Ignacio in Bogota, Colombia. In order to determine the factors associated with the development of acute cellular rejection, a generalized estimating equation approach was used, with an interchangeable correlation structure. The lowest value of quasi-likelihood information criterion and P < .05 was considered significant. Results. Fifty-five patients (49.3 +/- 11.1 years old) were included. The mortality during the first month was 16.3% and the accumulated mortality during the first year was 23.6%. The incidence of the acute cellular rejection was higher during the third month after the transplant (79.9%); most of them were acute cellular rejection grade 1. The factors associated with the development of the rejection were the cyclosporine levels out of the therapeutic range in several periods of evaluation (P < .03) and the age of the receptor (P = .049). Conclusions. Using advanced modeling methodologies of longitudinal data we identified that the factors associated with acute cellular rejection during the first year after the transplant are related to the therapeutic levels of the calcineurin inhibitor (cyclosporin) during the first 6 months of follow-up and the age of the receptor.",Article,"Toro-Trujillo, E.; Garcia, E.; Garcia-Pena, A.A.; Munoz-Velandia, O.M.; Marino, A.",,RISK-FACTORS;TACROLIMUS;IMPACT;AGE,Colombia,2-s2.0-85058555444

Green marketing campaigns and instruction in university curricula are an opportunity to influence producers' and consumers' decision-making process in a positive way. This research aims to understand the instructional effects of non-compulsory university courses linked to sustainability and the circular economy (SCE) on students' motivations and behavior. We analyze students' proclivities to consume products and develop more sustainable habits before and after enrolling in SCE courses. Results confirm that the courses impacted students' propensities toward sustainable consumption. Therefore, the biggest changes in the six dimensions underlying green consumption reveal four key recommendations for developing a green marketing strategy. We recommend firms to 1) engage in green education, 2) create community, 3) be aware of consumer diversity, and 4) not differentiate by gender. For this reason, we argue that university education may greatly influence students' mindset concerning sustainable behavior.

Objective: To evaluate the neuroendocrine response to hypoxic stress during a daytime nap and its cognitive impact. Design, Subject, and Setting: Randomized, single-blind, three period cross-over pilot study conducted with 15 healthy lowlander subjects (8 women) with a mean (SD) age of 29(6) years (Clinicaltrials identifier: NCT04146857, ). Interventions: Volunteers underwent a polysomnography, hematological and cognitive evaluation around a 90 min midday nap, being allocated to a randomized sequence of three conditions: normobaric normoxia (NN), normobaric hypoxia at FiO(2) 14.7% (NH15) and 12.5% (NH13), with a washout period of 1 week between conditions. Results: Primary outcome was the interbeat period measured by the RR interval with electrocardiogram. Compared to normobaric normoxia, RR during napping was shortened by 57 and 206 ms under NH15 and NH13 conditions, respectively (p < 0.001).

Therefore, in Bogota a home-visit based program was instituted to increase screening uptake. However, around 40% of the visited women fail to attend their Pap smear test appointments. Using this program as a case study, this paper presents a methodology that combines machine learning methods, using routinely collected administrative data, with Champion's Health Belief Model to assess women's beliefs about cervical cancer screening. The aim is to improve the cost-effectiveness of behavioural interventions aiming to increase attendance for screening. The results presented here relate specifically to the case study, but the methodology is generic and can be applied in all low-income settings. Methods This is a cross-sectional study using two different datasets from the same population and a sequential modelling approach. To assess beliefs, we used a 37-item questionnaire to measure the constructs of the CHBM towards cervical cancer screening. Data were collected through a face-to-face survey (N = 1699). We examined instrument reliability using Cronbach's coefficient and performed a principal component analysis to assess construct validity. Then, Kruskal-Wallis and Dunn tests were conducted to analyse differences on the HBM scores, among patients with different poverty levels. Next, we used data retrieved from administrative health records (N = 23,370) to fit a LASSO regression model to predict individual no-show probabilities. Finally, we used the results of the CHBM in the LASSO model to improve its accuracy. Results Nine components were identified accounting for 57.7% of the variability of our data. Lower income patients were found to have a lower Health motivation score (p-value < 0.001), a higher Severity score (p-value < 0.001) and a higher Barriers score (p-value < 0.001). Additionally, patients between 25 and 30 years old and with higher poverty levels are less likely to attend their appointments (O.R 0.93 (CI: 0.83-0.98) and 0.74 (CI: 0.66-0.85), respectively). We also found a relationship between the CHBM scores and the patient attendance probability. Average AUROC score for our prediction model is 0.9. Conclusion In the case of Bogota, our results highlight the need to develop education campaigns to address misconceptions about the disease mortality and treatment (aiming at decreasing perceived severity), particularly among younger patients living in extreme poverty. Additionally, it is important to conduct an economic evaluation of screening options to strengthen the cervical cancer screening program (to reduce perceived barriers). More widely, our prediction approach has the potential to improve the cost-effectiveness of behavioural interventions to increase attendance for screening in developing countries where funding is limited.",Article,"Ferro, D.B.; Bayer, S.; Brailsford, S.; Smith, H.",Cervical cancer screening; Health belief model; No-show prediction; Hard-to-reach women,Cervical cancer screening;Health belief model;No-show prediction;Hard-to-reach women;MIDDLE-INCOME COUNTRIES;IMPACT;MODEL;APPOINTMENTS;MORTALITY;BREAST;RATES,United Kingdom;Colombia,2-s2.0-85131486939

These policies were aimed to protect the surrounding rural areas and consolidate a dense and multi-use city center. Internationally, these policies are criticized arguing that they increase the prices of urban land, which is opposed by the argument that this increase is compensated by raising height limits to avoid higher housing prices. The present study analyzed the height limits and the increase in the price of homes and land, gathering historical prices from different sources and crossing these data with the height regulations of each era. The results show that the increases in the height limits and their use by real estate investment were differentiated and contrary to the intentions of zoning plans, greater in the areas of high social stratum, moderate in the middle stratum, and smaller and even negative for the low stratum. The land in the high stratum sector increased more than seventeen times in value while housing prices remained stable; the valuation was much lower in the lower stratum and housing is now more expensive",Article,"Yunda, J.G.; Ballesteros, N.C.",URBAN GROWTH BOUNDARY; DENSIFICATION; LAND VALUE; HOUSE VALUE; BOGOTA,URBAN GROWTH BOUNDARY;DENSIFICATION;LAND VALUE;HOUSE VALUE;BOGOTA;GROWTH BOUNDARY;PRICES;IMPACT;PORTLAND;CITY,Colombia,2-s2.0-85090689804;2-s2.0-85090689804

This study aimed at analyzing the traumatic experience many years ago on the current psycho-emotional status of displaced families as well as the ongoing inequalities regarding displaced and non-displaced communities in one of the most affected areas by the armed conflict. An interview survey was conducted among 211 displaced families and 181 non-displaced families in 2 adjacent compounds in Valledupar, Colombia. The questionnaire used questions from the validated national survey and was revised and applied by staff members of the departmental secretary of health who conducted additional in-depth interviews. The study showed that the living conditions of the displaced community were precarious. The past traumatic events many years ago and the current difficult living conditions are associated with psychological problems being more frequent among the displaced people. The displaced people had experienced more violent acts and subsequently had a larger number of emotional symptoms (fright, headache, nervousness, depression, and sleeplessness). Other stress factors like economic problems, severe disease or death of family members and unemployment prevailed among displaced persons. The non-displaced lived in a more protected environment with less exposure to violence and stress, although belonging to a similarly low socio-economic stratum.

The aim of this study was to determine the impact of trainee involvement in oesophagectomy on postoperative outcomes in an international multicentre setting. Methods Data from the multicentre Oesophago-Gastric Anastomosis Study Group (OGAA) cohort study were analysed, which comprised prospectively collected data from patients undergoing oesophagectomy for oesophageal cancer between April 2018 and December 2018. Procedures were grouped by the level of trainee involvement, and univariable and multivariable analyses were performed to compare patient outcomes across groups. Results Of 2232 oesophagectomies from 137 centres in 41 countries, trainees were involved in 29.1 per cent of them (n = 650), performing only the abdominal phase in 230, only the chest and/or neck phases in 130, and all phases in 315 procedures. For procedures with a chest anastomosis, those with trainee involvement had similar 90-day mortality, complication and reoperation rates to consultant-performed oesophagectomies (P = 0.451, P = 0.318, and P = 0.382, respectively), while anastomotic leak rates were significantly lower in the trainee groups (P = 0.030). Procedures with a neck anastomosis had equivalent complication, anastomotic leak, and reoperation rates (P = 0.150, P = 0.430, and P = 0.632, respectively) in trainee-involved versus consultant-performed oesophagectomies, with significantly lower 90-day mortality in the trainee groups (P = 0.005). Conclusion Trainee involvement was not found to be associated with significantly inferior postoperative outcomes for selected patients undergoing oesophagectomy. The results support continued supervised trainee involvement in oesophageal cancer surgery. The aim of this study was to determine the impact of trainee involvement in oesophagectomy on perioperative outcomes in the international multicentre Oesophago-Gastric Anastomosis Audit (OGAA).

Multiple Sclerosis (MS) is a chronic inflammatory demyelinating disease associated with neurological disability. Clinical features include: motor function, cerebellar and visual, sensory disturbances and psychiatric comorbidities. There is little literature available on the quality of life of patients and their caregivers. Objective. Assess the quality of life of patients with MS and their caregivers in Colombia, since there is no information on the subject in this particular population to establish comprehensive management plans. Materials and methods. Was used the questionnaire MusiQol, CareQol and depression of Beck. A prospective analytical observational protocol was designed to include patients aged 18 to 65 years with diagnosis of Relapsing-Remitting MS (RR) between October 2014 and 2015 at the San Ignacio University Hospital. Quantitative variables, Spearman correlations. Data analysis with Student T-Test and Mann-Whitney U. Results. 55 patients with MS RR In 27%, chronic fatigue was the most common comorbidity. The MusiQol revealed a good basal quality of life, which remained at similar levels in the follow-ups of 6 months and 12 months. Quality of life was good during the study, since there were no statistically significant differences between baseline and follow-up MusiQol scores A good quality of life was observed in caregivers.

Alternative metrics assessing the impact of scientific publications on social networks have been created. Our study aims to assess the correlation between the activity of internal medicine journals on social networks and traditional metrics based on citations. Methods: Internal medicine journals were identified in the SClmago-Scopus database and information on traditional impact metrics was extracted. In addition, alternative metrics of activity were determined for Facebook, Twitter, YouTube, and Instagram. The correlation was assessed through Spearman's correlation coefficient. Results: Of 134 Internal Medicine journals, 17 had a presence on the social networks evaluated. The SJR index was higher in journals with a presence on social networks vs. those without (59 vs. 18, p < .0001). The overall correlation between the SJR index and the number of followers/year was very strong for Facebook (Spearman's correlation coefficient 0.95, p < .05) and strong for Twitter (Spearman's correlation coefficient 0.54 p < .05). Conclusions: Our study suggests that there is a very strong correlation between social network activity metrics (mainly Facebook and Twitter) compared to traditional metrics based on the number of citations of internal medicine journals.

Although some elements that can affect sexuality have been described in this population like body image or lifestyle changes, being a necessity to understand these difficulties, as well as to know the strategies the same patients have used to improve their sexual life. A review of the literature was performed using the following databases: Medline, Central, Embase, Scopus, Lilacs and Psycinfo. The include studies required a qualitative or mixed method approach with the purpose of investigating the sexual issues of people with ostomies along with their strategies to improve their sexual life. A total of 1039 articles were reviewed by title and abstract. Among these, 17 references were selected for full-text review. Based on these, an ostomy seems to compromise three individual aspects: physical, emotional and social. The physical aspect is associated with the mechanical difficulties caused by the ostomy, such as the act of coitus. The emotional aspect is related to self-esteem alterations due to changes in an individual's physical appearance. Lastly, the social aspect is related to the perception of their partner, their family and other peers. The sexuality of people with ostomies should be approached before and after the surgery. Partners of the individuals should be involved throughout the explanation of the process in order to help the patient recover faster and, therefore, avoid hampering their sexual lives.",Article,"Medina-Rico, M.; Zarate-Velasco, A.M.; Quinonez, A.; Lopez-Ramos, H.",Sexuality; Sex education; Ostomy; Colombia,Sexuality;Sex education;Ostomy;Colombia;QUALITY-OF-LIFE;STOMA;PATIENT;HEALTH;CHALLENGES;UROSTOMY;IMPACT,Colombia,2-s2.0-85075105966;2-s2.0-85075105966

This work proposes to perform spectral estimation using the Box-Cox transformation and differentiation in order to obtain stationary multivariate time series in a wide sense. Additionally, Principal Component Analysis (PCA) is applied to reduce their dimensionality. Method: Three different UV-Vis absorbance time series for different Colombian locations were studied: (i) El- Salitre Wastewater Treatment Plant (WWTP) in Bogota; (ii) Gibraltar Pumping Station (GPS) in Bogota; and (iii) San-Fernando WWTP in ItagtiI. Each UV-Vis absorbance time series had equal sample number (5705). The estimation of the spectral power density is obtained using the average of modified periodograms with rectangular window and an overlap of 50 %, with the 20 most important harmonics from the Discrete Fourier Transform (DFT) and Inverse Fast Fourier Transform (IFFT). Results: Absorbance time series dimensionality reduction using PCA, resulted in 6, 8 and 7 principal components for each study site respectively, altogether explaining more than 97 % of their variability. Values of differences below 30 % for the UV range were obtained for the three study sites, while for the visible range the maximum differences obtained were: (i) 35 % for El-Salitre WWTP; (ii) 61 % for GPS; and (iii) 75 % for San-Fernando WWTP. Conclusions: The Box-Cox transformation and the differentiation process applied to the UV-Vis absorbance time series for the study sites (El-Salitre, GPS and San-Fernando), allowed to reduce variance and to eliminate tendency of the time series. A pre-processing of UV-Vis absorbance time series is recommended to detect and remove outliers and then apply the proposed process for spectral estimation.",Article,"Plazas-Nossa, L.; Avila, M.A.; Torres, A.",Box-Cox Transformation; Periodogram; Principal Components Analysis; Power spectral density; Stationarity; UV-Vis sensor,Box-Cox Transformation;Periodogram;Principal Components Analysis;Power spectral density;Stationarity;UV-Vis sensor;WASTE-WATER;NONSTATIONARY;MANAGEMENT;EFFICIENT;SYSTEMS;IMPACT,Colombia,

Most of the studies are focused on some diseases (for example, tuberculosis, salmonellosis, and brucellosis), but there are few studies on other diseases which are not officially controlled but also have an impact on the economy. This work is a systematic literature review on models (as a theoretical scheme, generally in mathematical form) used in the epidemiological analysis of bovine infectious diseases in the dairy farming sector. In this systematic literature review, criteria were defined for cattle, models, and infectious diseases to select articles on Scopus, IEEE, Xplorer, and ACM databases. The relations between the found models (model type, function and the proposed objective in each work) and the bovine infectious diseases, and the different techniques used and the works over infectious disease in humans, are presented. The outcomes obtained in this systematic literature review provide the state-of-the-art inputs for research on models for the epidemiological analysis of infectious bovine diseases.

We explore the tensions that emerge between individual motives and sustainability spheres when making food consumption choices in a university community in Bogota, Colombia. This complex phenomenon is addressed through a qualitative methodology based on observations, visual diaries, and a game-based protocol, which allow us to delve into food consumption motives while trying to avoid social desirability bias. Our results show a plate that is high in cereals, roots, tubers, plantains, and animal-based protein, and low in vegetables, fruits, and plant-based proteins. Behind this plate, most tensions emerge between family traditions and other sustainability spheres. These tensions are related to socio-affective risks, animal suffering, time constraints, effort, and monetary costs.

The largest factories that have historically processed asbestos include five asbestos-cement facilities located in the cities of Sibate (Cundinamarca), Cali (Valle del Cauca), and Barranquilla (Atlantico), and Manizales (Caldas), which has two, as well as a friction products facility in Bogota D.C. An asbestos chrysotile mine has also operated in Colombia since 1980 in Campamento (Antioquia). In the framework of developing the National Asbestos Profile for Colombia, in this study, we estimated the population residing in the vicinity of asbestos processing plants or the mine and, therefore, potentially at risk of disease. Using a geographic information system, demographic data obtained from the last two general population censuses were processed to determine the number of people living within the concentric circles surrounding the asbestos facilities and the mine. In previous studies conducted in different countries of the world, an increased risk of asbestos-related diseases has been reported for people living at different distance bands from asbestos processing facilities. Based on these studies, circles of 500, 1000, 2000, 5000, and 10,000 m radii, centered on the asbestos processing facilities and the mine that operated in Colombia, were combined with the census data to estimate the number of people living within these radii. Large numbers of people were identified. It is estimated that in 2005, at the country level, 10,489 people lived within 500 m of an asbestos processing facility or mine.

A scoping review,"BACKGROUND: Case management interventions have shown to be effective to prevent musculoskeletal pain and disability, but a single definition has not been achieved, nor an agreed profile for case managers. OBJECTIVE: To describe the elements that define case management and case managers tasks for return-to-work of workers with musculoskeletal disorders (MSDs). METHODS: A comprehensive computerized search of articles published in English until February 16, 2021 was carried out in several bibliographic databases. Grey literature was obtained through a search of 13 key websites. A peer-review screening of titles and abstracts was carried out. Full text in-depth analysis of the selected articles was performed for data extraction and synthesis of results. RESULTS: We identified 2,422 documents.

Results from a national prevalence study,"Objective To describe the prevalence of overactive bladder determining patient-reported outcome measures (PROMS) and potential risk factors. Methods A cross-sectional population-based study to estimate lower urinary tract symptoms (LUTS) prevalence in the Colombian population was performed (COBaLT study). Overactive bladder (OAB) was assessed using 2002 International Continence Society definitions and the Report on the Terminology for Female Pelvic Floor Dysfunction. PROMS were included to evaluate participant's perceptions of health-related quality of life (QoL). Spanish validated questionnaires were used, including the International Consultation on Incontinence Questionnaire Overactive Bladder (ICIQ-OAB) and Patient Perception of Bladder Condition (PPBC) scale. Results A total of 1060 individuals were assessed. The mean age of participants was 42.2 years, and most participants were Hispanic (93.15%). The overall prevalence of OAB syndrome was 31.70%, and it was more frequently reported in women than in men (39.25% vs. 24.15%). Most participants with OAB did not perceive their symptoms as bothersome. The most bothersome symptom, associated with moderate/severe impact in QoL was urinary urgency. According to the PPBC questionnaire 75.6% of the participants reported that their bladder condition does not cause any problem, while 11.% reported moderate to severe bother. The multivariable model showed high blood pressure and anxiety were associated with OAB in men. In females, depression, obstructive sleep apnea, IBS, and pelvic organ prolapse were associated with OAB syndrome. Conclusions Using the symptomatic definition of OAB can overestimate the real impact and burden of the condition, and treatment should be targeted to those symptomatic patients with QoL impairment as they would benefit from further management. The questionnaires seem to overestimate the condition, since we assessed it from a PROMS perspective there is not such a marked QoL impact.",Article,"Santander, J.; Plata, M.; Zuluaga, L.; Azuero, J.; Daza, F.; Trujillo, C.G.; Caicedo, J.I.; Rondon, M.",overactive bladder; PROMS; quality of life,overactive bladder;PROMS;quality of life;URINARY-TRACT SYMPTOMS;QUALITY-OF-LIFE;PELVIC ORGAN PROLAPSE;INCONTINENCE;IMPACT;HYPERTENSION;VALIDATION;SEEKING;WOMEN;PPBC,Colombia,2-s2.0-85125433015

The Global Burden of Disease (GBD) studies done in 1990 and 2000 have been the only studies to quantify non-fatal health outcomes across an exhaustive set of disorders at the global and regional level. Neither effort quantified uncertainty in prevalence or years lived with disability (YLDs). Methods Of the 291 diseases and injuries in the GBD cause list, 289 cause disability. For 1160 sequelae of the 289 diseases and injuries, we undertook a systematic analysis of prevalence, incidence, remission, duration, and excess mortality. Sources included published studies, case notification, population-based cancer registries, other disease registries, antenatal clinic serosurveillance, hospital discharge data, ambulatory care data, household surveys, other surveys, and cohort studies. For most sequelae, we used a Bayesian meta-regression method, DisMod-MR, designed to address key limitations in descriptive epidemiological data, including missing data, inconsistency, and large methodological variation between data sources. For some disorders, we used natural history models, geospatial models, back-calculation models (models calculating incidence from population mortality rates and case fatality), or registration completeness models (models adjusting for incomplete registration with health-system access and other covariates). Disability weights for 220 unique health states were used to capture the severity of health loss. YLDs by cause at age, sex, country, and year levels were adjusted for comorbidity with simulation methods. We included uncertainty estimates at all stages of the analysis. Findings Global prevalence for all ages combined in 2010 across the 1160 sequelae ranged from fewer than one case per 1 million people to 350 000 cases per 1 million people. Prevalence and severity of health loss were weakly correlated (correlation coefficient -0.37). In 2010, there were 777 million YLDs from all causes, up from 583 million in 1990. The main contributors to global YLDs were mental and behavioural disorders, musculoskeletal disorders, and diabetes or endocrine diseases. The leading specific causes of YLDs were much the same in 2010 as they were in 1990: low back pain, major depressive disorder, iron-deficiency anaemia, neck pain, chronic obstructive pulmonary disease, anxiety disorders, migraine, diabetes, and falls. Age-specific prevalence of YLDs increased with age in all regions and has decreased slightly from 1990 to 2010. Regional patterns of the leading causes of YLDs were more similar compared with years of life lost due to premature mortality. Neglected tropical diseases, HIV/AIDS, tuberculosis, malaria, and anaemia were important causes of YLDs in sub-Saharan Africa. Interpretation Rates of YLDs per 100 000 people have remained largely constant over time but rise steadily with age. Population growth and ageing have increased YLD numbers and crude rates over the past two decades. Prevalences of the most common causes of YLDs, such as mental and behavioural disorders and musculoskeletal disorders, have not decreased. Health systems will need to address the needs of the rising numbers of individuals with a range of disorders that largely cause disability but not mortality. Quantification of the burden of non-fatal health outcomes will be crucial to understand how well health systems are responding to these challenges. Effective and affordable strategies to deal with this rising burden are an urgent priority for health systems in most parts of the world.",Article,"Vos, T.; Flaxman, A.D.; Naghavi, M.; Lozano, R.; Michaud, C.;

The Global Burden of Disease 2016 Study (GBD 2016) provides a comprehensive assessment of cause-specific mortality for 264 causes in 195 locations from 1980 to 2016. This assessment includes evaluation of the expected epidemiological transition with changes in development and where local patterns deviate from these trends. Methods We estimated cause-specific deaths and years of life lost (YLLs) by age, sex, geography, and year. YLLs were calculated from the sum of each death multiplied by the standard life expectancy at each age. We used the GBD cause of death database composed of: vital registration (VR) data corrected for under-registration and garbage coding; national and subnational verbal autopsy (VA) studies corrected for garbage coding; and other sources including surveys and surveillance systems for specific causes such as maternal mortality. To facilitate assessment of quality, we reported on the fraction of deaths assigned to GBD Level 1 or Level 2 causes that cannot be underlying causes of death (major garbage codes) by location and year. Based on completeness, garbage coding, cause list detail, and time periods covered, we provided an overall data quality rating for each location with scores ranging from 0 stars (worst) to 5 stars (best). We used robust statistical methods including the Cause of Death Ensemble model (CODEm) to generate estimates for each location, year, age, and sex. We assessed observed and expected levels and trends of cause-specific deaths in relation to the Socio-demographic Index (SDI), a summary indicator derived from measures of average income per capita, educational attainment, and total fertility, with locations grouped into quintiles by SDI. Relative to GBD 2015, we expanded the GBD cause hierarchy by 18 causes of death for GBD 2016. Findings The quality of available data varied by location. Data quality in 25 countries rated in the highest category (5 stars), while 48, 30, 21, and 44 countries were rated at each of the succeeding data quality levels. Vital registration or verbal autopsy data were not available in 27 countries, resulting in the assignment of a zero value for data quality. Deaths from non-communicable diseases (NCDs) represented 72.3% (95% uncertainty interval [UI] 71.2-73.2) of deaths in 2016 with 19.3% (18.5-20.4) of deaths in that year occurring from communicable, maternal, neonatal, and nutritional (CMNN) diseases and a further 8.43% (8.00-8.67) from injuries. Although age-standardised rates of death from NCDs decreased globally between 2006 and 2016, total numbers of these deaths increased; both numbers and age-standardised rates of death from CMNN causes decreased in the decade 2006-16-age-standardised rates of deaths from injuries decreased but total numbers varied little. In 2016, the three leading global causes of death in children under-5 were lower respiratory infections, neonatal preterm birth complications, and neonatal encephalopathy due to birth asphyxia and trauma, combined resulting in 1.80 million deaths (95% UI 1.59 million to 1.89 million). Between 1990 and 2016, a profound shift toward deaths at older ages occurred with a 178% (95% UI 176-181) increase in deaths in ages 90-94 years and a 210% (208-212) increase in deaths older than age 95 years. The ten leading causes by rates of age-standardised YLL significantly decreased from 2006 to 2016 (median annualised rate of change was a decrease of 2.89%); the median annualised rate of change for all other causes was lower (a decrease of 1.59%) during the same interval. Globally, the five leading causes of total YLLs in 2016 were cardiovascular diseases; diarrhoea, lower respiratory infections, and other common infectious diseases; neoplasms; neonatal disorders; and HIV/AIDS and tuberculosis. At a finer level of disaggregation within cause groupings, the ten leading causes of total YLLs in 2016 were ischaemic heart disease, cerebrovascular disease, lower respiratory infections, diarrhoeal diseases, road injuries, malaria, neonatal preterm birth complications, HIV/AIDS, chronic obstructive pulmonary disease, and neonatal encephalopathy due to birth asphyxia and trauma. Ischaemic heart disease was the leading cause of total YLLs in 113 countries for men and 97 countries for women. Comparisons of observed levels of YLLs by countries, relative to the level of YLLs expected on the basis of SDI alone, highlighted distinct regional patterns including the greater than expected level of YLLs from malaria and from HIV/AIDS across sub-Saharan Africa; diabetes mellitus, especially in Oceania; interpersonal violence, notably within Latin America and the Caribbean; and cardiomyopathy and myocarditis, particularly in eastern and central Europe. The level of YLLs from ischaemic heart disease was less than expected in 117 of 195 locations. Other leading causes of YLLs for which YLLs were notably lower than expected included neonatal preterm birth complications in many locations in both south Asia and southeast Asia, and cerebrovascular disease in western Europe. Interpretation The past 37 years have featured declining rates of communicable, maternal, neonatal, and nutritional diseases across all quintiles of SDI, with faster than expected gains for many locations relative to their SDI. A global shift towards deaths at older ages suggests success in reducing many causes of early death. YLLs have increased globally for causes such as diabetes mellitus or some neoplasms, and in some locations for causes such as drug use disorders, and conflict and terrorism. Increasing levels of YLLs might reflect outcomes from conditions that required high levels of care but for which effective treatments remain elusive, potentially increasing costs to health systems.

,,,464,WOS:000410630000002,2017,"Global, regional, and national under-5 mortality, adult mortality, age-specific mortality, and life expectancy, 1970-2016: a systematic analysis for the Global Burden of Disease Study 2016","Background Detailed assessments of mortality patterns, particularly age-specific mortality, represent a crucial input that enables health systems to target interventions to specific populations. Understanding how all-cause mortality has changed with respect to development status can identify exemplars for best practice. To accomplish this, the Global Burden of Diseases, Injuries, and Risk Factors Study 2016 (GBD 2016) estimated age-specific and sex-specific all-cause mortality between 1970 and 2016 for 195 countries and territories and at the subnational level for the five countries with a population greater than 200 million in 2016. Methods We have evaluated how well civil registration systems captured deaths using a set of demographic methods called death distribution methods for adults and from consideration of survey and census data for children younger than 5 years. We generated an overall assessment of completeness of registration of deaths by dividing registered deaths in each location-year by our estimate of all-age deaths generated from our overall estimation process. For 163 locations, including subnational units in countries with a population greater than 200 million with complete vital registration (VR) systems, our estimates were largely driven by the observed data, with corrections for small fluctuations in numbers and estimation for recent years where there were lags in data reporting (lags were variable by location, generally between 1 year and 6 years). For other locations, we took advantage of different data sources available to measure under-5 mortality rates (U5MR) using complete birth histories, summary birth histories, and incomplete VR with adjustments; we measured adult mortality rate (the probability of death in individuals aged 15-60 years) using adjusted incomplete VR, sibling histories, and household death recall. We used the U5MR and adult mortality rate, together with crude death rate due to HIV in the GBD model life table system, to estimate age-specific and sex-specific death rates for each location-year. Using various international databases, we identified fatal discontinuities, which we defined as increases in the death rate of more than one death per million, resulting from conflict and terrorism, natural disasters, major transport or technological accidents, and a subset of epidemic infectious diseases; these were added to estimates in the relevant years. In 47 countries with an identified peak adult prevalence for HIV/AIDS of more than 0.5% and where VR systems were less than 65% complete, we informed our estimates of age-sex-specific mortality using the Estimation and Projection Package (EPP)-Spectrum model fitted to national HIV/AIDS prevalence surveys and antenatal clinic serosurveillance systems. We estimated stillbirths, early neonatal, late neonatal, and childhood mortality using both survey and VR data in spatiotemporal Gaussian process regression models. We estimated abridged life tables for all location-years using age-specific death rates. We grouped locations into development quintiles based on the Sociodemographic Index (SDI) and analysed mortality trends by quintile. Using spline regression, we estimated the expected mortality rate for each age-sex group as a function of SDI. We identified countries with higher life expectancy than expected by comparing observed life expectancy to anticipated life expectancy on the basis of development status alone. Findings Completeness in the registration of deaths increased from 28% in 1970 to a peak of 45% in 2013; completeness was lower after 2013 because of lags in reporting. Total deaths in children younger than 5 years decreased from 1970 to 2016, and slower decreases occurred at ages 5-24 years. By contrast, numbers of adult deaths increased in each 5-year age bracket above the age of 25 years. The distribution of annualised rates of change in age-specific mortality rate differed over the period 2000 to 2016 compared with earlier decades: increasing annualised rates of change were less frequent, although rising annualised rates of change still occurred in some locations, particularly for adolescent and younger adult age groups. Rates of stillbirths and under-5 mortality both decreased globally from 1970. Evidence for global convergence of death rates was mixed; although the absolute difference between age-standardised death rates narrowed between countries at the lowest and highest levels of SDI, the ratio of these death rates-a measure of relative inequality-increased slightly. There was a strong shift between 1970 and 2016 toward higher life expectancy, most noticeably at higher levels of SDI. Among countries with populations greater than 1 million in 2016, life expectancy at birth was highest for women in Japan, at 86.9 years (95% UI 86.7-87.2), and for men in Singapore, at 81.3 years (78.8-83.7) in 2016. Male life expectancy was generally lower than female life expectancy between 1970 and 2016, and the gap between male and female life expectancy increased with progression to higher levels of SDI. Some countries with exceptional health performance in 1990 in terms of the difference in observed to expected life expectancy at birth had slower progress on the same measure in 2016. Interpretation Globally, mortality rates have decreased across all age groups over the past five decades, with the largest improvements occurring among children younger than 5 years. However, at the national level, considerable heterogeneity remains in terms of both level and rate of changes in age-specific mortality; increases in mortality for certain age groups occurred in some locations. We found evidence that the absolute gap between countries in age-specific death rates has declined, although the relative gap for some age-sex groups increased. Countries that now lead in terms of having higher observed life expectancy than that expected on the basis of development alone, or locations that have either increased this advantage or rapidly decreased the deficit from expected levels, could provide insight into the means to accelerate progress in nations where progress has stalled.

Standardised questionnaires were used to ascertain pain that interfered with everyday activities and exposure to possible risk factors in 12,426 participants from 47 occupational groups (mostly nurses and office workers). Associations with risk factors were assessed by Poisson regression. The 1-month prevalence of DLBP in nurses varied from 9.6% to 42.6%, and that of DWHP in office workers from 2.2% to 31.6%. Rates of disabling pain at the 2 anatomical sites covaried (r = 0.76), but DLBP tended to be relatively more common in nurses and DWHP in office workers. Established risk factors such as occupational physical activities, psychosocial aspects of work, and tendency to somatise were confirmed, and associations were found also with adverse health beliefs and group awareness of people outside work with musculoskeletal pain. However, after allowance for these risk factors, an up-to 8-fold difference in prevalence remained. Systems of compensation for work-related illness and financial support for health-related incapacity for work appeared to have little influence on the occurrence of symptoms. Our findings indicate large international variation in the prevalence of disabling forearm and back pain among occupational groups carrying out similar tasks, which is only partially explained by the personal and socioeconomic risk factors that were analysed.

,,,115,WOS:000449133000019,2018,The effect of fasting or calorie restriction on autophagy induction: A review of the literature,"Autophagy is a lysosomal degradation process and protective housekeeping mechanism to eliminate damaged organelles, long-lived misfolded proteins and invading pathogens. Autophagy functions to recycle building blocks and energy for cellular renovation and homeostasis, allowing cells to adapt to stress. Modulation of autophagy is a potential therapeutic target for a diverse range of diseases, including metabolic conditions, neurodegenerative diseases, cancers and infectious diseases. Traditionally, food deprivation and calorie restriction (CR) have been considered to slow aging and increase longevity. Since autophagy inhibition attenuates the anti-aging effects of CR, it has been proposed that autophagy plays a substantive role in CR-mediated longevity. Among several stress stimuli inducers of autophagy, fasting and CR are the most potent non-genetic autophagy stimulators, and lack the undesirable side effects associated with alternative interventions. Despite the importance of autophagy, the evidence connecting fasting or CR with autophagy promotion has not previously been reviewed. Therefore, our objective was to weigh the evidence relating the effect of CR or fasting on autophagy promotion. We conclude that both fasting and CR have a role in the upregulation of autophagy, the evidence overwhelmingly suggesting that autophagy is induced in a wide variety of tissues and organs in response to food deprivation.",Review,"Bagherniya, M.; Butler, A.E.; Barreto, G.E.; Sahebkar, A.",Calorie restriction; Fasting; Autophagy,Calorie restriction;Fasting;Autophagy;CHAPERONE-MEDIATED AUTOPHAGY;SKELETAL-MUSCLE AUTOPHAGY;NEURODEGENERATIVE DISEASE;HEART-DISEASE;CELL-DEATH;AGING RAT;LIVER;MECHANISMS;HEALTH;ADAPTATION,Iran;Qatar;Colombia;Chile,2-s2.0-85052732760

Assessing the certainty of evidence in the importance of outcomes or values and preferences-inconsistency, imprecision, and other domains","Objective: To provide Grading of Recommendations, Assessment, Development, and Evaluation (GRADE) guidance for assessing inconsistency, imprecision, and other domains for the certainty of evidence about the relative importance of outcomes. Study Design and Setting: We applied the GRADE domains to rate the certainty of evidence in the importance of outcomes to several systematic reviews, iteratively reviewed draft guidance, and consulted GRADE members and other stakeholders for feedback. Results: We describe the rationale for considering the remaining GRADE domains when rating the certainty in a body of evidence for the relative importance of outcomes. As meta-analyses are not common in this context, inconsistency and imprecision assessments are challenging. Furthermore, confusion exists about inconsistency, imprecision, and true variability in the relative importance of outcomes. To clarify this issue, we suggest that the true variability is neither equivalent to inconsistency nor imprecision. Specifically, inconsistency arises from population, intervention, comparison and outcome and methodological elements that should be explored and, if possible, explained. The width of the confidence interval and sample size inform judgments about imprecision. We also provide suggestions on how to detect publication bias and discuss the domains to rate up the certainty. Conclusion: We provide guidance and examples for rating inconsistency, imprecision, and other domains for a body of evidence describing the relative importance of outcomes.

Forty pulp samples were obtained from healthy premolars in which extraction was indicated for orthodontic reasons. Thirty of these premolars were assigned into three different tooth-bleaching protocols: group 1 (n = 10): Opalescence Xtra Boost (Ultradent Products, South Jordan, UT) (38% H2O2) for 15 minutes; group 2 (n = 10): Lase Peroxide (DMC, Brazil) (35% H2O2) activated with infrared laser diode (Biolux; BioArt, Brazil) for 3 minutes, and group 3 (n = 10): Zoom! Whitening System (Discuss Dental, Culver City, CA) (25% H2O2) light activated for 20 minutes. The remaining 10 healthy premolars serve as a control group. Teeth were anesthetized immediately after bleaching and were extracted 10 minutes later. All pulp samples were processed and SP was measured by radioimmunoassay. Greater SP expression was found in the Zoom! Whitening System, followed by the Lase Peroxide group, Opalescence Xtra Boost, and the lower SP values were for the control group. Analysis of variance showed statistically significant differences between groups (p = 0.0001). Tukey HSD post hoc tests showed significant differences in the light (p < 0.01) and laser (p < 0.05) activated bleaching systems when compared with control values. It can be concluded that light- and laser-activated tooth-bleaching systems increase SP expression in human dental pulp significantly higher than normal values.

,,,70,WOS:000400686700002,2017,Gaps and barriers in the control of blood glucose in people with type 2 diabetes,"Background: Glycaemic control is suboptimal in a large proportion of people with type 2 diabetes who are consequently at an increased and avoidable risk of potentially severe complications. We sought to explore attitudes and practices among healthcare professionals that may contribute to suboptimal glycaemic control through a review of recent relevant publications in the scientific literature. Methods: An electronic search of the PubMed database was performed to identify relevant publications from January 2011 to July 2015. The electronic search was complemented by a manual search of abstracts from key diabetes conferences in 2014/2015 available online. Results: Recently published data indicate that glycaemic control is suboptimal in a substantial proportion (typically 40%-60%) of people with diabetes. This is the case across geographic regions and in both low- and higher-income countries. Therapeutic inertia appears to be an important contributor to poor glycaemic control in up to half of people with type 2 diabetes. In particular, prescribers are often willing to tolerate extended periods of mild' hyperglycaemia as well as having low expectations for their patients. There are often delays of 3years or longer in initiating or intensifying glucose-lowering therapy when needed. Conclusion: Many people with type 2 diabetes are failed by current management, with approximately half not achieving or maintaining appropriate target blood glucose levels, leaving these patients at increased and avoidable risk of serious complications.

The objective of this study was to assess the associations between objective built environment characteristics and LTPA. Methods: A cross-sectional multilevel study was conducted in 27 neighborhoods in which 1315 adults aged 18-65 years were surveyed. An adapted version of the IPAQ (long version) was used to assess LTPA. Objective BE characteristics were obtained using Geographic Information Systems. Associations were assessed using multilevel polytomous logistic regression. Results: Compared with inactive people, those who resided in neighborhoods with the highest tertile dedicated to parks (7.4% to 25.2%) were more likely to be regularly active (POR = 2.05, 95% CI = 1.13-3.72; P = 0.021). Those who resided in neighborhoods with presence of TransMilenio stations (mass public transportation system) were more likely to be irregularly active (POR = 1.27,95% CI = 1.07-1.50, P = 0.009) as compared with inactive people. Conclusions: These findings showed that park density and availability of TransMilenio stations at neighborhood level are positively associated with LTPA.

Longitudinal analyses using data from the Hispanic Established Populations for the Epidemiologic Study of the Elderly (1995-96/2004-05). Five southwestern states: Texas, New Mexico, Colorado, Arizona, and California. Mexican Americans aged 67 and older with complete information on the frailty index and the Mini Mental State Examination (MMSE) (n=1,815). Cognitive impairment determined by a score in the MMSE < 21. Frailty defined as three or more of the following components: 1) weight-loss, 2) weakness, 3) self-reported exhaustion, 4) slow walking speed, and 5) low physical activity level. Sociodemographic characteristics and chronic medical conditions were used as covariates. Mortality was determined using the National Death Index or by proxy. As MMSE score declines over time, the percent of frail individuals increases in a linear fashion. Frailty and cognitive impairment are independent risk factors for mortality after controlling for all covariates (HR 2.03 95% CI 1.57-2.62; HR 1.26 95% CI 1.05-1.52, respectively). When both cognitive impairment and frailty were added to the model, HR for individuals with cognitive impairment was no longer statistically significant. The relation between frailty and cognitive impairment needs careful analysis in this population to establish pathways increasing mortality and decreasing quality of life.

Methods A cross-sectional study was conducted in Colombia, among 5237 older adults aged >= 60 years old (58.5% women, 70.5 +/- 7.8 years), according to 'SABE Survey 2015'. Handgrip strength data were obtained with a Takei dynamometer. Sociodemographic variables, five domains of intrinsic capacity (i.e. locomotion, vitality, cognition, psychological, and sensory), and medical conditions were assessed and analyzed. Adjustments variables were age, ethnicity, socio-economic status, urbanicity, body mass index, smoking status, alcohol intake, drug use, physical activity, and co-morbid chronic diseases. Sex-stratified analyses were conducted with logistic regression models. Results Handgrip strength was greater among men than among women (26.7 +/- 8.5 vs. 16.7 +/- 5.7 kg, respectively, P < 0.001) at all ages. Weak handgrip strength cut-off points ranged from 17.4 to 8.6 and from 10.1 to 4.9 in men and women, respectively. Overall, participants with optimal handgrip strength had better intrinsic capacity [in men, odds ratio (OR) = 0.62, 95% confidence interval (CI) 0.53 to 0.71; P < 0.001; and in women, OR = 0.79, 95% CI 0.68 to 0.92; P = 0.002] than their weaker counterparts. Also, men with optimal handgrip strength had a lower risk of hospitalization (OR = 0.47, 95% CI 0.29 to 0.78; P = 0.004) than their weaker counterparts. Conclusions This study is the first to describe handgrip strength values and cut-off points for muscle weakness among a nationally representative sample of Colombian older adults by age and sex. After categorizing older adults as weak or not weak based on the handgrip cut-off points, non-weakness was associated with a decreased odds of intrinsic capacity impairments. These cut-off points may be good candidates for clinical assessment of risks to physical and mental health in older Colombian adults.",Article,"Ramirez-Velez, R.; Correa-Bautista, J.E.; Garcia-Hermoso, A.; Cano, C.A.; Izquierdo, M.",Skeletal muscle; Handgrip; Older adults; Locomotion; Vitality; Cognition; Mental health,Skeletal muscle;Handgrip;Older adults;Locomotion;Vitality;Cognition;Mental health;GRIP STRENGTH;COGNITIVE DECLINE;PHYSICAL FUNCTION;ANOREXIA-NERVOSA;CUT POINTS;LMS METHOD;SARCOPENIA;DEPRESSION;COMMUNITY;HEALTH,Colombia;Chile;Spain,2-s2.0-85062785956

A total of 9218 non-institutionalized individuals living in urban areas (age range 15-65 years) were assessed in the Latin American Study of Nutrition and Health (ELANS), a multicenter household population-based cross-sectional survey. Socio-demographic data were collected. Total and added sugar intakes were measured using two non-consecutive 24-h dietary recalls. The prevalence of excessive sugar intake was estimated. A large proportion of individuals showed high consumption of total and added sugar intake, which reflected in the high prevalence of excessive sugar intake. With minimal differences across countries, in general, women, individuals with high SEL, and younger people had higher percentages of total energy intake from total and added sugar intake, and of contribution of carbohydrates from total and added sugars.

The MMSE was examined as total score (0-30) or divided into 2 global domains: (1) no-memory (score 0-24): Orientation, attention, and language; and (2) memory (score 0-6): working and delayed memory. Mean age and total MMSE were 72.7 years and 24.6 at baseline, and 81.7 years and 20.5 at 11 years of follow-up. Spanish-speaking participants had less education (4.1 vs 7.4 years, P < .0001), they had significantly higher adjusted mean scores for memory, no-memory, and total MMSE compared with English-speaking participants. In multivariate longitudinal analyses, participants with more years of education performed better than those with less education, especially in total MMSE and no-memory domain. Spanish-speaking participants with 4 to 6 years of education had higher memory scores than those speaking English (estimate 0.40, standard error [SE] - 0.14, P < .001), 7 to 11 (estimate 0.27, standard error - 0.13, P < .01) or 12+ (estimate 0.44, standard error = 0.13, P < .001).

It also documents sociopolitical barriers and facilitators involved in urban interventions linked with active living in the ten most populated urban settings of Latin America. The synthesis of evidence indicates that several attributes of urban environments are associated with physical activity, including land-use mix and cycling infrastructure. The documentary analysis indicated that despite the benefits and opportunities provided by the programs and existing infrastructure in the examined cities, an overall concern is the rising inequality in the coverage and distribution of the initiatives in the region. If these programs and initiatives are to achieve a real population level effect that helps to reduce health disparities, they need to examine their social and spatial distribution within the cities so they can reach underserved populations and develop to their full potential.

Consequently, families frequently must provide care to individuals with TBI. Because they are rarely prepared for the associated demanding medical needs and financial burden, family caregivers are at risk for physical and emotional problems, which can negatively influence their individual and family functioning. Whereas scholars have examined the influence of survivor functioning on caregiver burden, few have explicitly recognized that caregiver burden also influences survivor functioning. Results of a multivariate linear regression suggest that, in a sample of 51 pairs of TBI survivors and their caregivers living in Colombia, survivors receiving care from a family member who reported a higher level of burden had poorer objective neuropsychological functioning than those receiving care from a family member who reported a lower level of burden, after controlling for survivor education and history of occupational therapy. Therefore, a family-focused approach might maximize intervention effectiveness, especially for Latin American and Hispanic families, which tend to be characterized by a strong sense of familism.

Using the Mini Nutritional Assessment (MNA), we evaluated the nutritional status and factors associated to malnutrition in this population with regression models. Results: From the 1,573 older adults interviewed, 4.58% were malnourished and 34.27% were at risk of malnourishment. Factors associated to malnourishment were older age (odds ratio [OR] =1.02, 95% confidence interval [CI] = [1.00, 1.04]), perceived poor health (OR = 1.46, 95% CI = [1.13, 1.88]), comorbidities (OR = 1.16, 95% CI = [1.04, 1.30]), and low calf circumference (OR = 2.63, 95% CI = [1.86, 3.72]).

Given that most of the empirical experience with IVES practice has been in the Global North, we need to understand this practice in other contexts such as the Global South and Latin America. Based on 21 studies that applied IVES approaches, we evaluated how IVES is being implemented in socio-ecological contexts in Latin America and the challenges and ways forward for implementing it in this region. Leaders of the case studies completed a questionnaire that addressed these questions based on an analytical framework. Our case studies demonstrated advances in: integrating socio-cultural and monetary valuations, developing interdisciplinary and transdisciplinary approaches, communicating results, and providing policy recommendations that go beyond economic incentives. However, more efforts are still needed to engage some of the social actors, integrate ecological values, and address value trade-offs and power relations. Challenges and ways forward for implementing IVES approaches can be grouped into five areas: (i) building a culture of transdisciplinary research; (ii) promoting holistic versus split disciplinary valuations; (iii) engaging with environmental and civil society organizations and local leaders; (iv) supporting less powerful social actors and bringing out their voices through the IVES process; and (v) generating new means of communicating multiple perspectives at multiple scales. Our study empirically shows how new paths in socio-ecological contexts in Latin America are opening up to include the complex, conflicting, and diverse views of the importance of nature.

Several randomized control studies that found success in preventing the progression to T2D in high-risk populations have identified early and intensive intervention based on an individualized prevention model as the key factor for participant benefit. The global prevalence of both overweight and obesity has now been widely recognized as the major epidemic of the 21st century. Obesity is a major risk factor for the progression from normal glucose tolerance to prediabetes and then to T2D. However, not all obese individuals will develop prediabetes or progress to diabetes. Intensive, multicomponent behavioural interventions for overweight and obese adults can lead to weight loss. Diabetes medications, including metformin, GLP-1 agonists, glitazones, and acarbose, can be considered for selected high-risk patients with prediabetes when lifestyle-based programmes are proven unsuccessful. Nutrition education is the cornerstone of a healthy lifestyle. Also, physical activity is an integral part of the prediabetes management plan and one of the main pillars in the prevention of diabetes. Mobile phones, used extensively worldwide, can facilitate communication between health professionals and the general population, and have been shown to be helpful in the prevention of T2D.

Obesity is frequently associated with risk factors for cardiovascular and metabolic diseases. Central obesity is a marker of increased intra-abdominal adiposity and a known risk factor for atherosclerosis and diabetes; it is also a good predictor of risk for coronary events, cardiovascular mortality, diabetes and metabolic syndrome. A less predictive alternate measurement is known as the body mass index (BMI). Objective. Obesity prevalence was estimated first by BMI and then by abdominal obesity (measured by waist circumference, WC) in primary care patients. Materials and methods. As part of an international study, primary care physicians recruited consecutive patients aged 18 to 80 years who consulted for any reason on two pre-specified half-days. Age, gender, smoking status and history of cardiovascular disease or diabetes were recorded. Height, weight and WC were measured using standard methods. Pregnant women and subjects unwilling to participate were excluded. Results. A total of 3,795 patients from 105 primary care centers located throughout Colombia were evaluated. The mean age was 45 years (69% females). Of these, 60.7% of males and 53.9% of females were overweight or obese according to their BMI; 24.6% of males and 44.6% of females had abdominal obesity when National Cholesterol Education Program guidelines were used, but numbers changed to 62.5% and 67.0% when the International Diabetes Federation guidelines were used. Obesity, either determined by BMI or by WC, was associated with higher prevalence of diabetes, hypertension and dyslipidemia. Conclusions.

This study aimed to estimate the prevalence of Chagas disease in Colombia. Methods A systematic literature review and meta-analysis was conducted to select all observational studies reporting the prevalence of Chagas disease in Colombia, based on serological diagnosis in participants of any age and published between January 2007 and November 2017. Pooled estimates and 95% confidence intervals (95% CIs) were calculated using random effects models. In addition, the 12 statistic was calculated. Results The literature search yielded a total of 1,510 studies; sixteen articles with relevant prevalence data were included in the systematic review. Of these, only 12 articles were included for entry in the meta-analysis. The pooled prevalence of Chagas disease across studies was 2.0% (95% CI: 1.0-4.0). A high degree of heterogeneity was found among studies (I-2 > 75%; p < 0.001). The publication bias was not statistically significant (Egger's test, p = 0.078). The highest pooled prevalences were found in the adult population (3.0%, 95% CI: 1.0-4.0), pregnant women (3.0%, 95% CI: 3.0-4.0) and the Orinoco region (7.0%, 95% CI: 2.2-12.6). Conclusions The results indicate that the T. cruzi-infected population is aging, the adult population, pregnant women and that the Orinoco region (department of Casanare) have the highest prevalences.

To date, research has provided limited data on the possible association between an active lifestyle and a healthy composition of human microbiota. This review was aimed to summarize the results of human studies comparing the microbiome of healthy individuals with different physical activity amounts. Methods We searched Medline/Ovid, NIH/PubMed, and Academic Search Complete between August-October 2020. Inclusion criteria comprised: (a) cross-sectional studies focused on comparing gut microbiome among subjects with different physical activity levels; (b) studies describing human gut microbiome responses to any type of exercise stimulus; (c) studies containing healthy adult women and men. We excluded studies containing diet modifications, probiotic or prebiotic consumption, as well as studies focused on diabetes, hypertension, cancer, hormonal dysfunction. Methodological quality and risk of bias for each study were assessed using the Risk Of Bias In Non-randomized Studies-of Interventions tool. The results from cross-sectional and longitudinal studies are shown independently. Results A total of 17 articles were eligible for inclusion: ten cross-sectional and seven longitudinal studies. Main outcomes vary significantly according to physical activity amounts in longitudinal studies. We identified discrete changes in diversity indexes and relative abundance of certain bacteria in active people. Conclusion As literature in this field is rapidly growing, it is important that studies incorporate diverse methods to evaluate other aspects related to active lifestyles such as sleep and dietary patterns.

METHOD: Two hundred and seventy-one family members of an individual with TBI in Mexico, Colombia, Spain, Denmark, and Norway completed the Family Needs Questionnaire. RESULTS: Eight of the ten needs rated as most important globally were from the Health Information subscale. Importance ratings on the Health Information, Professional Support, and Involvement With Care subscales were similar across countries, but Mexican family members rated Instrumental Support needs as less important than Colombian, Spanish, and Danish family members, and also rated their Community Support needs as less important than Danish and Spanish family members. Mexican family member's rated emotional support needs as less important than Colombian, Spanish, and Danish family members. Globally, the needs rated as most often met were from the Health Information subscale, and the most unmet needs were from the Emotional Support subscale.

The first system consisted in the simulated digestion [composed of an initial (before digestion), oral, gastric, and intestinal phases] of a soybean oil-in-water emulsion containing PPs at initial concentrations of 0 (control) and 0.1% (w/w) of PPs with pancreatic lipase. The microstructure and particle size distribution of the soybean oil-in-water emulsions were characterized before (initial phase) and after (intestinal phase) the in vitro digestion process. During the intestinal phase the free fatty acid released were measured as well. The second system consisted of an acidic (H2SO4) back titration of Tris-HCl buffer after the hydrolysis of triacetin with pancreatic lipase, in the presence of PPs at concentrations of 0 (control) and 0.01% (w/v). Among tested PPs A [MW, 209 kDa; and MD, 73.3% (mol/mol)] was the most effective one in inhibiting the activity of pancreatic lipase in both the static in vitro digestion model (63% activity as compared to the control) and the simplified model (61% activity as compared to the control). From the contour plot, after mathematical modelling, MD of PPs had a greater influence as compared to MW on the inhibition of the activity of pancreatic lipase, with higher inhibition of enzymatic activity as the MD was increased.

Thus, functional status measurement is a marker of social wellbeing. Objective: To determine and characterize the socio-demographic factors and health conditions related to functional impairment in older adults in Bogota, Colombia. Materials and methods: Data was collected from the SABE Bogota Study. Functional status was assessed using the Barthel and Lawton scales. Independent variables included socio-demographic factors, comorbidities, anthropometric measurements and physical activity (by tertiles). Bivariate analyzes were performed, and multivariate results were obtained using linear regression models. Results: There were 2,000 participants aged 60 years and older, with a mean age of 71.2 +/- 8 years. Younger age (standardized beta = -0.15, p<0.01), fewer medications (beta= -0.13, p<0.01), higher MMSE score (beta = 0.3, p<0.01), higher level of physical activity (middle beta tertile = 0.18, p<0.01, and higher beta tertile= 0.18, p<0.01vs lower tertile) and better performance in the handgrip test (beta= 0.10, p<0.01) were associated with better function in daily life instrumental activities. Similarly, higher MMSE score (beta= 0.3, p<0.01) and better performance in the handgrip test (beta= 0.07, p= 0.02) were associated with better function in daily life basic activities.

The SABE Study, 2015","Background: The short physical performance battery (SPPB) is a physical performance test of lower extremity function designed for non-disabled older adults. We aimed to establish reference values for community-dwelling Colombian adults aged 60 years or older in terms of (1) the total score; (2) the three subtest scores (walking speed, standing balance performance, and five times sit-to-stand test); and (3) the time to complete the five times sit-to-stand test, s and the walking speed test. Additionally, we sought to explore how much of the variance in the SPPB subtest scores could be explained by anthropometric variables (age, body mass, height, body mass index, and calf circumference). Methods: Participants were men and women aged 60 years or older who participated in the Health and Well-being and Aging Survey in Colombia, 2015. A sample of 4,211 participants (57.3% women) completed the SPPB test, and their anthropometric variables were evaluated. Age-specific percentiles were calculated using the LMS method (3rd, 10th, 25th, 50th, 75th, 90th, and 97th percentiles). Results: The mean SPPB total score for the entire sample was 8.73 (2.0) points. On average, the total SPPB score was 0.85 points greater in men than in women (p < 0.001). Significant sex differences were observed in all three age groups tested (60-69, 70-79, and 80+ years). In the full sample, our findings suggested that age, body mass, height, body mass index, and calf circumference are significant contributors to walking speed (p < 0.001) after controlling for confounding factors, including ethnicity, socioeconomic status, and urbanicity.

The challenge is how to produce accessible, healthy, diverse, nutritious, safe and abundant food in a way that is sustainable, allowing farmers to exert food sovereignty while at the same time addressing ecosystem conservation. The aim of this study is to explore the potential contribution of traditional agriculture to food sovereignty and also to understand the challenges that indigenous communities are facing today. Our case studies are from six Latin-American countries: Chile, Peru, Ecuador, Colombia, Guatemala and Mexico, where we carried out semi-structured, guided visits and field observations. Our results shed light on how traditional agricultural knowledge, techniques and practices can contribute to these issues, but also to the need of protecting and recovering the cultural and ecological heritage. There is a need to resolve public management issues, related to development investment, technological packages, cultural loss and gender.

Participants: Fifty-one pairs of individuals with TBI and their caregivers from two major cities in Colombia completed a comprehensive psychosocial evaluation that included information related to patient and caregiver sociodemographic factors, patient factors, and caregiver estimation of patient neurobehavioral functioning. Outcome measures: Caregiver burden (Zarit Burden Interview) and caregiver depression (PHQ-9). Results: Generalized linear models revealed that patient language problems and caregiver perception of patient functioning on six neurobehavioral domains were related to caregiver burden. Caregiver socioeconomic status and caregiver perception of patient functioning on six neurobehavioral domains were related to caregiver depression. These variables were then selected as candidates for the multiple regression models, which were fit separately for caregiver depression and burden, and revealed that caregivers' perception of patient depression was the only factor associated with both caregiver burden and depression.

Dietary data mainly rely on proxy respondents, but little is known about the determinants of misreporting of EI among Latin American (LA) populations. This study was conducted using data from the multicenter Latin American Study of Nutrition and Health that consisted of information about sociodemographics, physical activity, and dietary intake from 9218 individuals aged 15 to 65 years who were living in urban areas in 8 LA countries (Argentina, Brazil, Chile, Colombia, Costa Rica, Ecuador, Peru, and Venezuela). Goldberg methodology was applied to classify the participants into categories of overreporter (OR), plausible reporter (PR), or underreporter (UR) of EI. Associations between misreporting and covariates were examined by the Kruskal-Wallis test, logistic regression, and linear regression. The prevalence of UR was 12.1% and OR was 14.1%. Costa Rica had the highest percentage of UR (24.4%) and the lowest of OR (7.3%), and Colombia had the lowest of UR (5.7%) and the highest of OR (22.4%). Furthermore, underreporters were more likely to be females from older groups with minimal education, white, physically active, overweight or obese, and living in Costa Rica. Overreporters were more likely to be younger, single, of low socioeconomic level, nonwhite, physically active, underweight or with normal weight, and from Colombia. The results demonstrated that sex, age, race, education status, and nationality seemed to influence the reporting behavior, which is essential to correctly interpreting potentially biased associations between diet and health outcomes, and improving nutritional interventions and public health policies.

To study the inequalities in various mortality indicators for the departments of Colombia with respect to national figures, and to identify associations between the departmental mortality indicators and departmental socioeconomic indicators. Methods. To determine mortality rates and the Gini coefficient for mortality for the departments, data from the death registry were adjusted by the estimated registry coverage for each of the departments. Five socioeconomic indicators were selected: Gini coefficient for income distribution, Human Development Index, per capita gross domestic product, per capita social investment ( in health care, etc.), and percentage of the population with health care services from the country's social security system. The differences among the departments were then studied and compared to the national averages. The Spearman's rank correlation coefficient was calculated to find associations between the mortality indicators and each of the five socioeconomic indicators. Results. For Colombia overall, death registry coverage was estimated at 76%, with Choco department having the lowest coverage ( 35%), and Caldas department the highest ( 88%). The associations between the Gini coefficient for mortality and four of the socioeconomic indicators studied were significant. The national mortality rate was significantly associated with one socioeconomic indicator. Death caused by diabetes mellitus was associated with all the socioeconomic indicators; death caused by undernutrition or by diarrhea, with four socioeconomic indicators; and death from traffic accidents, with two socioeconomic indicators. Homicide was not associated with any of the socioeconomic indicators studied. Conclusions. Adjusting the death registry data produced mortality indicators that were more valid for drawing associations with socioeconomic indicators. The Gini coefficient of mortality, mortality from undernutrition, and mortality from diarrheal diseases were more suitable indicators for evaluating the inequalities among the departments because of their higher levels of association with the socioeconomic indicators. Regarding diabetes- related mortality, the associations with all the socioeconomic indicators could be due to systematic errors that lesser- developed departments made when the cause of death was being assigned. A department is a large unit for analysis, which can make it difficult to identify associations between socioeconomic indicators and deaths due to homicide or traffic accidents.",Article,"Garcia, J.R.",health status indicators; mortality; life tables; socioeconomic factors; population characteristics; Colombia,"health status indicators;mortality;life tables;socioeconomic factors;population characteristics;Colombia;INCOME INEQUALITY;HEALTH;FARR,WILLIAM;DEPRIVATION;PATTERNS",Colombia,2-s2.0-34249900983

Methods: A qualitative, descriptive-interpretative study was developed. Forty-seven women participated in five focus group discussions. Also, in-depth interviews with six women were conducted. Findings: Results showed that women with lower adherence sell their antiretroviral medication to satisfy economic needs, and prioritize the care of their HIV-positive children over their own adherence needs. In contrast, women with higher adherence were found to participate in social support groups offered by nongovernmental organizations. Conclusion: These findings underscore the need to understand the social determinants that facilitate and/or hinder adherence among women in poverty-associated conditions. Results indicate the need to facilitate access to treatment on a timely and continual basis: provide economic resources, including support to meet basic needs as well as subsidies for transportation to health care centers; and explore mechanism for supporting the care of their offspring.

We aimed to examine associations among SES and cardiometabolic risk factors in Colombian children. Methods We used data from a population-based study of 1282 children aged 6-10 years from Bucaramanga, Colombia. SES was classified according to household wealth, living conditions and access to public utilities. Anthropometric and biochemical parameters were measured at a clinic visit. Cardiometabolic risk factors were analysed continuously using linear regression and as binary outcomes-according to established paediatric cut points-using logistic regression to calculate OR and 95% CIs. Results Mean age of the children was 8.4 (SD 1.4) and 51.1% of the sample were boys. Odds of overweight/obesity, abdominal obesity and insulin resistance were greater among higher SES. Compared with the lowest SES stratum, children in the highest SES had higher odds of overweight/obesity (OR=3.25, 95% CI 1.89 to 5.57), abdominal obesity (OR=2.74, 95% CI 1.41 to 5.31) and insulin resistance (OR=2.60, 95% CI 1.81 to 3.71). In contrast, children in the highest SES had lower odds of hypertriglyceridaemia (triglycerides >= 90th centile; OR=0.28, 95% CI 0.14 to 0.54) and low (<= 10th centile) high-density lipoprotein (HDL) cholesterol (OR=0.35, 95% CI 0.15 to 0.78). Conclusions In Colombian children, SES is directly associated with obesity and insulin resistance, but inversely associated with dyslipidaemia (hypertriglyceridaemia and low HDL cholesterol).

Women of childbearing age (WCA) are particularly vulnerable to micronutrient inadequacy. The Minimum Dietary Diversity for Women (MDD-W) has been used widely as a proxy measurement of micronutrient adequacy. This study aimed to assess the association between MDD-W and nutrients adequacy among WCA of eight Latin American countries. Nutrient intakes from 3704 WCA were analyzed with two 24-hour dietary recalls. Dietary diversity was calculated based on ten food groups with a cut-off point of intake >= 5 groups. The mean dietary diversity score was 4.72 points, and 57.7% of WCA achieved MDD-W. Vitamin D and E showed a mean Nutrient Adequacy Ratio (NAR) of 0.03 and 0.38, respectively. WCA with a diverse diet (MDD-W > 5) reported a significantly higher intake of most micronutrients and healthy food groups with less consumption of red and processed meats and sugar-sweetened beverages. MDD-W was significantly associated with the mean adequacy ratio (MAR) of 18 micronutrients evaluated. Nevertheless, even those women with a diverse diet fell short of meeting the Estimated Average Requirements (EAR) for vitamins D and E.

It is considered a multicausal disease, and one of the determining factors is nutritional imbalances, which include high-fat diets. In this paper, we use the zebrafish model to assess the impact of overfeeding and a high-fat diet in somatic and cardiac parameters in young and adult zebrafish. The results show that fish receiving a high-fat diet showed greater weight gain compared to fish receiving a standard fat diet. Additionally, changes in the heart, including increases in size, a change in the triangular shape of the ventricle to a globular shape, and an increase in the thickness of the trabeculae of the spongy myocardium were observed. These changes could be indicators of cardiovascular overload. The results show that there is a direct relationship between the intake of a high-fat diet and obesity, which in turn can induce cardiac changes, supporting the hypothesis of the relationship between high-fat diets and cardiovascular risk factors. Given the genetic similarity between zebrafish and humans, these results could be extrapolated to human beings, and the findings similarly highlight the importance of incorporating a balanced diet from the early life stages to reduce the risk of cardiovascular disease.",Article,"Vargas, R.; Vasquez, I.C.",Nutrition; Body mass index; Obesity; Myocardium; Cardiovascular risk,Nutrition;Body mass index;Obesity;Myocardium;Cardiovascular risk;METABOLIC SYNDROME;BIRTH-WEIGHT;CHILDHOOD;INSULIN;HEALTH;ADIPOKINES;CHILDREN;IMPACT;GROWTH,Colombia,2-s2.0-85028325305

The aim of this study was to test the hypothesis that pain, which is localized to the low back, differs epidemiologically from that which occurs simultaneously or close in time to pain at other anatomical sites Summary of Background Data. Low back pain (LBP) often occurs in combination with other regional pain, with which it shares similar psychological and psychosocial risk factors. However, few previous epidemiological studies of LBP have distinguished pain that is confined to the low back from that which occurs as part of a wider distribution of pain. Methods. We analyzed data from CUPID, a cohort study that used baseline and follow-up questionnaires to collect information about musculoskeletal pain, associated disability, and potential risk factors, in 47 occupational groups (office workers, nurses, and others) from 18 countries. Results. Among 12,197 subjects at baseline, 609 (4.9%) reported localized LBP in the past month, and 3820 (31.3%) nonlocalized LBP. Nonlocalized LBP was more frequently associated with sciatica in the past month (48.1% vs. 30.0% of cases), occurred on more days in the past month and past year, was more often disabling for everyday activities (64.1% vs. 47.3% of cases), and had more frequently led to medical consultation and sickness absence from work. It was also more often persistent when participants were followed up after a mean of 14 months (65.6% vs. 54.1% of cases).

However, evidence on patterns of transportation in Latin America is scarce. Therefore, the aim of this study was to quantify and characterise socio-demographic patterns of public, private and active travel in Latin American countries. Methods: Data from the Latin American Study of Nutrition and Health, a population-based, cross-sectional survey conducted in eight Latin American countries including Argentina, Brazil, Chile, Colombia, Costa Rica, Ecuador, Peru and Venezuela (n = 9218; age range: 15-65 years). Transportation modes include public (bus, taxi, subway and train), private (car and motorcycle) and active (walking and/or cycling). Outcomes for this study include time spent in different modes of transportation. We performed overall and country-specific descriptive analyses to examine differences by sex, age, socioeconomic and education level. Results: For the overall cohort, public transport represent 34.9% of the total travel time, whereas private, walking and cycling represent 48.2%, 10.6% and 6.3% of the total travel time. Time spent using public travel was highest in Venezuela (48.4%); Peru had the highest proportions of private travel (52.5%); Time spent walking and cycling was highest in Costa Rica (14.8% and 12.2%, respectively). The average travel time spent in public and private transport were 299.5 min/week (95% CI: 292.4307.0) and 379.6 min/week (95% CI: 368.0, 391.5) respectively; figures for walking and cycling were 186.9 min/week (95% CI: 181.8, 191.9) and 201.1 min/week (95% CI: 187.8, 216.9). Conclusions: Public and private transport were the most common forms of travel in Latin America. Active travel (walking or cycling) represent 17% of total physical activity, therefore, promoting and providing the right infrastructure for active commuting could translate in increasing the population overall levels of physical activity in Latin America.",Article,"Ferrari, G.L.D.; Kovalskys, I.; Fisberg, M.; Gomez, G.; Rigotti, A.; Sanabria, L.Y.C.; Garcia, M.C.Y.; Torres, R.G.P.; Herrera-Cuenca, M.; Zimberg, I.Z.; Guajardo, V.; Pratt, M.; Goncalves, P.B.; Rosales-Salas, J.; Cristi-Montero, C.; Rodriguez-Rodriguez, F.; Waddell, H.; Petermann-Rocha, F.; Celis-Morales, C.A.; Chaput, J.P.; Scholes, S.; Sole, D.",Physical activity; Active travel; Transport; Latin America,Physical activity;Active travel;Transport;Latin America;PHYSICAL-ACTIVITY QUESTIONNAIRE;HEALTH;EPIDEMIOLOGY;RELIABILITY,Chile;Brazil;Argentina;Costa Rica;Colombia;Ecuador;Peru;Venezuela;United States;United Kingdom;Canada,2-s2.0-85075428798;2-s2.0-85075428798;2-s2.0-85075428798;2-s2.0-85075428798
,,,13,WOS:000438481700013,2018,A tax on sugar sweetened beverages in Colombia: Estimating the impact on overweight and obesity prevalence across socio economic levels,"Colombia has a high prevalence of overweight (56%) and obesity (19%) among adults and is experiencing a growing trend in the prevalence of associated chronic conditions. Evidence suggests that sugar sweetened beverages (SSB) are associated to overweight/obesity, and that taxes on these beverages could reduce their associated health consequences. This paper assesses the potential effect of different levels of a SSB tax in Colombia on overweight and obesity prevalence. Using peer-reviewed local data on own-price elasticity of SSB, we applied a comparative risk assessment strategy to simulate the effect of the SSB tax on a nationally representative nutritional survey with 7140 adults in 2010 (ENSIN, 2010). Our results varied depending on the tax scenario, pass-through assumption and household socio economic strata (SES). We found that among individuals belonging to lower SES households, the SSB tax would reduce overweight and obesity between 1.5-4.9 and 1.1-2.4 percentage points (p < 0.05), respectively. Among individuals belonging to higher SES households, we found no statistically significant effects on obesity, and a reduction on overweight prevalence between 2.9 and 3.9 percentage points (p < 0.05). In the most conservative scenario (40% pass-through), a tax rate of at least 75 cents of Colombian peso (0.75 COP) per milliliter (24% of the average price) is needed to have statistically significant effects on both overweight and obesity prevalence among lower SES households. The results of this study suggest that a SSB tax could reduce the overweight and obesity prevalence in Colombia, especially among lower SES households. This study shows that SSB taxes have a particularly beneficial effect in the most vulnerable population. Additional social and individual benefits, or individual costs arising from the tax are not assessed in this research, implying that even larger health gains could be observed.",Article,"Vecino-Ortiz, A.I.; Arroyo-Ariza, D.",Colombia; Taxes; Sugar sweetened beverages; Overweight; Obesity,Colombia;Taxes;Sugar sweetened beverages;Overweight;Obesity;PASS-THROUGH;PRICES;HEALTH;METAANALYSIS;CONSUMPTION;BEHAVIOR;WELFARE;POLICY;RISK;FOOD,Colombia;United States,2-s2.0-85047630567;2-s2.0-85047630567

The objective was to examine the relationship between gait speed (GS) and body mass index (BMI) in men and women aged 75 years and older. Design Cross-sectional analysis. Setting, participants Data from the Aging Multidisciplinary Investigation (AMI), a French prospective cohort study with participants randomly selected from the farmer Health Insurance rolls. Measurements Usual GS was measured over a 4 meters-track. BMI was categorized using clinical cutpoints for European populations: (e.g, <20.0 kg/m(2); 20.0-24.9 kg/m(2); 25.0-29.9 kg/m(2); 30.0-34.9 kg/m(2);.35.0 kg/m(2)). Results The current analyses were performed in 449 participants. Mean age was 81 years. Being malnourished/obese was significantly associated with slow GS. Unadjusted and age-adjusted models showed that underweight, overweight and obesity statuses were significantly associated with slow GS for both women (0.83m/s [0.61; 1.04], 0.87m/s [0.72; 1.02], 0.70 m/s [0.41; 0.98], respectively) and men (0.83m/s [0.61; 1.04], 1.11m/s [1.03; 1.20], 0.97m/s [0.75; 1.19], respectively).

In Colombia, the distribution of sleep disorders remains unclear. We aimed to describe the distribution of sleep disorders, according to demographic, geographic and anthropometric characteristics, in adult Colombian populations. Methods: A multicenter study was conducted with 5474 participants recruited from three Colombian cities at different altitudes. A two-stage cluster sampling method was applied. Participants' mean age was 40.2 years and 53.8% were female. Collected data included demographic information and anthropometric characteristics of adiposity such as body mass index, neck circumference and waist circumference, as well as participants' scores on five scales used to assess sleep disorders. Disorders included sleepiness, obstructive sleep apnea (OSA), insomnia, poor sleep quality and restless legs syndrome; the scales were the Epworth Sleepiness Scale, Berlin questionnaire, STOP -Bang questionnaire, Pittsburgh Sleep Quality Index and diagnostic criteria for the restless legs syndrome set out by the International Restless Legs Syndrome Study Group. Results: Nearly two-thirds of the population reported at least one sleep disorder according to their results on the five scales (59.6% [95%CI 57.4; 61.81)]. This proportion was similar by sex. Prevalence of overweight was 34.8% and of obesity was 14.4%. Sleep disorders were more frequent among those aged 65 years or more (91.11 [95%CI 86.1; 94.43]), those who were obese (83.71% [95%Cl 78.94; 87.56]) and those who resided in the cities at the lowest altitude (72.4% [95%CI 70.2; 74.5]). Waist circumference showed a stronger association with sleep disorders among women than among men. Conclusions: Sleep disorders are common in Colombia, irrespective of sex and geographical location. They are associated with obesity. Abdominal obesity could explain the high frequency of sleep disorders among women. We believe that this part of the study will substantially contribute to the understanding of sleep disorders. Further research is needed to identify key factors behind the high prevalence rates of sleep disorders and obesity in Colombia. (C) 2016 The Authors.

Methods: The CORE Diabetes Model was used to simulate a hypothetical cohort of patients with T1D. Mean baseline characteristics were taken from a clinical study conducted in Colombia and a healthcare payer perspective was adopted, with a 5% annual discount rate applied to both costs and outcomes. Results: The integrated pump/CGM improved mean life expectancy by 3.51 years compared with MDI. A similar increase occurred in mean quality-adjusted life expectancy with an additional 3.81 quality-adjusted life years (QALYs). Onset of diabetes-related complications was also delayed as compared to MDI, and mean survival time free of complication increased by 1.74 years with integrated pump/CGM. Although this increased treatment costs of diabetes as compared to MDI, savings were achieved thanks to reduced expenditure on diabetes-related complications. The estimated incremental cost-effectiveness ratio (ICER) for SAP was Colombian Pesos (COP) 44,893,950 (approximately USD$23,200) per QALY gained. Conclusions: Improved blood glucose control associated to integrated pump/CGM results in a decreased incidence of diabetes-related complications and improves life expectancy as compared to MDI. Using recommended thresholds from the World Health Organization and previous coverage decisions about health technologies in Colombia, it is a cost-effective alternative to MDI for the treatment of type 1 diabetes in Colombia.

This qualitative study explored and compared determinants of adherence behaviors among 52 HIV-positive Colombian women in medium and high socioeconomic positions (SPs). Findings indicated that the two SP groups reported high adherence behaviors related to taking medication, following a diet, and executing lifestyle changes in line with healthcare providers' recommendations. Nevertheless, differences were observed between the two groups. While women with a medium SP disclosed their diagnosis, were empowered, and had acceptable access to economic resources that resulted in favorable adherence, their better off counterparts tended to hide their status and made a conscious effort to keep their adherence behaviors in secret due to HIV-related stigma.

Therefore, we characterized anthropometry, dietary intake, PA and sitting time (ST) in adolescents aged 15-17 years from eight Latin American countries. Methods: Six hundred seventy-one adolescents (41.4% girls) from the Latin American Study of Nutrition and Health (ELANS) were included. Nutritional status was classified by four BMI (kg/m(2)) categories. Waist circumference (WC) was categorized as above or below thresholds. Dietary intake was assessed through two non-consecutive 24-h dietary recalls. PA and ST were measured using the International Physical Activity Questionnaire (IPAQ). We calculated overall and country-specific estimates by sex and tested for differences between boys and girls. Results: Differences in the prevalence of overweightness (15.1 and 21.6%) and obesity (8.5 and 6.5%) between boys and girls, respectively, were statistically insignificant (p = 0.059). Average energy intake was 2289.7 kcal/day (95% CI: 2231-2350) for boys and 1904.2 kcal/day (95% CI: 1840-1963) for girls (p < 0.001). In relation to macronutrient intake for boys and girls, respectively, the average intake (expressed as percentage of total energy) was 15.0 and 14.9% for protein; 55.4 and 54.9% for carbohydrates; 14.1 and 14.5% for added sugar; 29.5 and 30.1% for total fat; and 9.6 and 9.9% for saturated fat (p > 0.05 for all outcomes). There was no statistically significant difference in the prevalence of total energy (TE) saturated fat and added sugar (>10% of TE) between girls and boys (49.6% versus 44.8 and 81.7% versus 76.1%, respectively). Prevalence of physical inactivity was 19% in boys and 43.7% in girls (p < 0.001). Median levels of vigorous-intensity PA and total PA were significantly higher for boys than for girls (p < 0.05 for both outcomes); whereas levels of ST were similar (273.7 versus 220.0 min/day for boys and girls, respectively; p > 0.05).

The period of lactation may provide an opportunity to modulate the risk of disease later in life. Our aim was to estimate the effect of maternal body mass index (BMI) and infant feeding mode, particularly breastfeeding practices, on the anthropometric status of children under 2 years in Colombia. Methods A secondary analysis was performed using the data from ENSIN 2010. Term infants under 2y, singleton, with a mother older than 18y, were included in the analysis. Outcomes were wasting (WLZ < -2SD), overweight (WLZ > +2SD) and stunting (LAZ < -2SD). Predictors were infant feeding (exclusive and predominant BF constructed from 24-h recall, age at introduction of liquids, semisolids and solids) and maternal BMI. Socioeconomic variables, maternal education and age, conditions during pregnancy and birth weight were analyzed as covariates. Results Mothers of overweight infants had higher BMI (Mean dif = 1.47 kg/m(2); 95% CI = 2.1, 0.8) than those with normal weight infants. Stunting and wasting were not predicted by maternal anthropometry or infant feeding mode.

In the present work, we describe for the first time, the functional effect of crude HPO supplementation on human antioxidant plasma/serum status as assessed by the total phenolic content (Folin-Ciocalteu), ORAC and TEAC assays. One hundred sixty eligible participants (>50 years) were randomized and assigned to one of the two treatments: 25mL hybrid palm oil (HPO group) or 25mL extra virgin olive oil (EVOO group) daily for 3 months. This study showed that supplementation of 25mL of HPO for a period of 3 months significantly increased (p<0.01) the total phenolic content (19.2%) as well as the antioxidant capacity of human plasma measured by both ORAC (92.1%) and TEAC (42.9%) methods. Furthermore, no significant differences were found between HPO and EVOO groups in a repeated measures analysis of variance for TPC (p=0.344), TEAC (p=0.217), and ORAC (p=0.318) values. These results confirm that HPO can be considered a promising tropical edible oil with potential beneficial health effects. Practical applications: The understanding of the antioxidant properties of an edible oil in vivo is of primary importance when evaluating its nutritional/functional characteristics and/or its potentiality to serve as an active ingredient for functional food preparations. The results of this study confirm that HPO can be considered a promising tropical edible oil with beneficial health properties since it is able to improve the antioxidant status of plasma in humans. This 3-month randomized trial reported examines and compares the effects of 25mL/day supplementation of crude hybrid palm oil (Elaeis oleiferaxElaeis guineensis), thought to be a possible tropical equivalent of the Mediterranean extra-virgin olive oil, to the ones of extra-virgin olive oil, which is considered as a gold standard in the functional dietary oils skyline. Interestingly, at the end of the third month of study, the effects obtained by the supplementation with hybrid palm oil are similar to those provided by the extra-virgin olive oil supplementation. In fact, hybrid palm oil consumption has been shown to significantly increase the total phenolic content (19.2%, p<0.01) as well as the antioxidant capacity of human plasma measured by both TEAC (42.9%, p<0.01) and ORAC (92.1% p<0.01) assays.",Article,"Ojeda, M.; Borrero, M.; Sequeda, G.; Diez, O.; Castro, V.; Garcia, A.; Ruiz, A.; Pacetti, D.; Frega, N.; Gagliardi, R.; Lucci, P.",Dietary antioxidants; Extra virgin olive oil; Functional ingredient; Hybrid palm oil; Phenols,Dietary antioxidants;Extra virgin olive oil;Functional ingredient;Hybrid palm oil;Phenols;VIRGIN OLIVE OIL;PHENOLIC-COMPOUNDS;BIOLOGICAL-ACTIVITIES;IN-VIVO;CONSUMPTION;HEALTH;OLEIN;FRUIT;FOOD,Colombia;Italy,2-s2.0-84970021815;2-s2.0-84970021815;2-s2.0-84970021815

However, there is a lack of knowledge about the prevalence and the impact of nutritional risk on outcomes in Colombia. The aim of the present study was to determine the prevalence of nutritional risk, to know how nutrition screening is routinely performed and to determine the impact of nutritional risk on the outcomes of in-hospital mortality and being discharged home outcomes. Methods: We conducted a descriptive analysis of selected data from 7 consecutive, annual, and crosssectional nutritionDay samples (2009-2015) including a total of 7,994 adult patients in 248 units in Colombia. Data is contrasted with the Latin American and worldwide results. The prevalence of nutritional risk was determined according to the malnutrition screening tool (MST). The impact of nutritional risk in Colombian patients regarding outcomes was assessed by a Fine and Gray competing risk regression model controlling for PANDORA score (age, BMI, length of stay before nutritionDay, cancer diagnosis, and mobility). Results: The prevalence of nutritional risk (MST score >= 2) in Colombia was 38%, 41% in Latin America, and 32% worldwide. Half of the Colombian units screened patients for malnutrition or nutritional risk on admission to hospital, compared to 80% in Latin America and 62% worldwide. Only 23% of the Colombian patients identified as being at nutritional risk in the nutritionDay survey received any nutritional therapy. The hospital mortality hazard ratio of Colombian patients at nutritional risk defined by MST was 1.94 (95% CI, 1.53,2.46; p < 0.001) and 0.82 of being discharged home (95% CI, 0.76,0.88, p < 0.001). Conclusions: This is the first large-scale study in Colombia evaluating the impact of nutritional risk on clinical outcomes showing an increase of in-hospital mortality and a reduction of being discharged home. Moreover, the study shows that nutritional risk is still highly prevalent worldwide implying the need to promote an optimal nutritional care. The participation of Latin American countries in the nutritionDay survey is an opportunity to increase knowledge and awareness of these issues.

Due to the link of SFA and different diseases, many studies have replaced the cheese fat content with unsaturated fatty acids (UFA) rich sources to improve its nutritional quality. The fat replacement has physicochemical, textural, and sensory effects on dairy matrix. To the food science is mandatory to know which technological strategies of milk processing improve the quality of the end products. The most relevant results reveal that fish oil (FO) and flaxseed oil (FSO) have been the most researched UFA-rich sources, microencapsulation has been the most studied incorporation technology because it allows the oil entrapment with minimal effects on the cheese quality, and non-thermal technologies allow greater UFA fortification in cheese, improving its nutritional quality.

We investigated the association between physical fitness and cognitive status. Further, we examined whether physical fitness mediates the association between cognitive functioning and aging. Design. Cross-sectional study. Setting. Urban and rural Colombian older adults. Methods. 4416 participants from the SABE study were included in the current analysis. Physical fitness was assessed with the handgrip test and the usual gait speed test. Cognitive status was evaluated through the Folstein Mini-Mental State Examination. A parallel mediation path was used to test the possible mediator role of physical fitness between aging and cognitive functioning. Results. Older adults with lower handgrip strength (HGS) were more likely to have mild-cognitive status than older adults with healthy HGS (OR = 1.53, 95% CI = 1.15; 2.02). In addition, older adults with a slower gait speed were more likely to have mild cognitive impairment (OR = 2.05, 95% CI = 1.54; 2.78). Age had an inverse relationship with cognitive function (beta = -0.110, 95% CI = -0.130; -0.100) and it was also inversely associated with HGS (beta = -0.003, 95% CI = -0.005; -0.002) and gait speed (beta = -0.010, 95% CI = -0.011; -0.009). The indirect effects, which indicate that the effect of age on cognitive function is transmitted through mediators, showed that both gait speed (beta = -0.028, 95% CI = -0.036; -0.020) and HGS (beta = -0.014, 95% CI = -0.024; -0.005) were independent mediators of the detrimental effect of aging on cognitive function.

We analyzed the effects of a bioactive nutrients-enriched-infant formula on children's behavior up to 2.5 years, compared to a standard infant formula or breastfeeding. Current analysis involved 70 children who were fed a standard infant formula (SF, n = 29) or a bioactive compounds enriched-infant formula (EF, n = 41), during their first 18 months of life, and 33 breastfed (BF) children (reference group) participating in the COGNIS study. Behavioral problems were evaluated using the Child Behavior Checklist at 18 months and 2.5 years. Different statistical analyses were performed using SPSS. EF children aged 2.5 years presented fewer pathological affective problems than SF children. Besides, SF children were classified more frequently as bordering on internalizing problems than BF children. Rates of externalizing problems were increased in SF infants compared to EF and BF infants. Higher maternal IQ was found to have beneficial effects on internalizing and total problem rate in their offspring at 18 months of life; finally, higher maternal educational level was related with fewer ADHD problems in children at 18 months, as well as internalizing, externalizing, total and anxiety problems in children aged 2.5 years.

Objectives We propose that healthy behaviors could lower the incidence of frailty. The aim is to describe the association between healthy behaviors (physical activity, vaccination, tobacco use, and cancer screening) and the incidence of frailty. Design This is a secondary longitudinal analysis of the Mexican Health and Aging Study (MHAS) cohort. Setting MHAS is a population-based cohort, of community-dwelling Mexican older adults. With five assessments currently available, for purposes of this work, 2012 and 2015 waves were used. Participants A total of 6,087 individuals 50-year or older were included. Measurements: Frailty was defined using a 39-item frailty index. Healthy behaviors were assessed with questions available in MHAS. Individuals without frailty in 2012 were followed-up three years in order to determine their frailty incidence, and its association with healthy behaviors. Multivariate logistic regression models were used to assess the odds of frailty occurring according to the four health-related behaviors mentioned above. Results At baseline (2012), 55.2% of the subjects were male, the mean age was 62.2 (SD +/- 8.5) years old. The overall incidence (2015) of frailty was 37.8%. Older adults physically active had a lower incidence of frailty (48.9% vs. 42.2%, p< 0.0001). Of the activities assessed in the adjusted multivariate models, physical activity was the only variable that was independently associated with a lower risk of frailty (odds ratio: 0.79, 95% confidence interval 0.71-0.88, p< 0.001). Conclusions Physically active older adults had a lower 3-year incidence of frailty even after adjusting for confounding variables. Increasing physical activity could therefore represent a strategy for reducing the incidence of frailty. Other so-called healthy behaviors were not associated with incident frailty, however there is still uncertainty on the interpretation of those results.",Article,"Borda, M.G.; Perez-Zepeda, M.U.; Samper-Ternent, R.; Gomez, R.C.; Avila-Funes, J.A.; Cano-Gutierrez, C.A.",Frailty; age; healthy lifestyle; epidemiology of aging; healthy aging,Frailty;age;healthy lifestyle;epidemiology of aging;healthy aging;PHYSICAL-ACTIVITY;OLDER-ADULTS;HEALTH;EXERCISE;RISK,Norway;Colombia;Mexico;Canada;United States;France,2-s2.0-85087138311

Methods: Data from the ELANS study, an observational multi-country study (n: 8336; 18-65 years), were used. Active transportation (walking and cycling) and leisure time physical activity was assessed using the International Physical Activity Questionnaire (long version). The obesity indicators considered were: body mass index, and waist and neck circumference. Results: In the total sample, the average time dedicated to active transportation was 24.3 min/day, with the highest amount of active transportation being Costa Rica (33.5 min/day), and the lowest being Venezuela (15.7 min/day). The countries with the highest proportion of active transportation were Ecuador (71.9%), and the lowest was Venezuela (40.5%). Results from linear regression analyses suggest that active transportation was significantly and independently associated with a lower body mass index (beta: -0.033; 95% CI: -0.064; -0.002), but not with waist circumference (beta: -0.037; 95% CI: -1.126; 0.390 and neck circumference (beta: -0.007; 95% CI: -0.269; 0.130).

Objective: To estimate the prevalence of HBP, knowledge, treatment and control in population aged >= 60 years, resident in Colombia, according to their ethnic condition. Methods: Population sample selected by multistage sampling. Ethnicity was defined based on skin color. HBP was defined as systolic blood pressure >= 140, and/or diastolic blood pressure >= 90 mm Hg, and/or the participants' self-report. Controlled HBP at a blood pressure value < 140/90, knowledge and treatment were identified by self-report. Results: 23,694 adults aged >= 60 years were included, of which 54.5%, 34.5% and 10.9% were respectively identified as having light, medium or dark skin color; 54.5% were women, and 78.1% resided in urban areas. The standardized prevalence of HBP, by age, was 57.7% (95% CI: 55.2 -60.2); 51.4% (95% CI: 47.3-55. 5), in men; and 62.9% (60.964.9), in women.

How such reforms transformed employment-related insurance and entitlements, however, has received significantly less attention. This study aims to understand how the employment insurance system operates in Colombia and to assess how the experience of workers seeking social security entitlements relates to the system's structure. We conducted an ethnographic study of the Colombian Occupational Risk System between May 2014 and March 2016, with two main components: 1) analysis of the system itself through in-depth interviews with 32 people working in leadership positions and a systematic review of the system's most important legislation, and 2) a study of people who experienced problems receiving entitlements and were challenging the assessment of their work-related illness or accident. We conducted in-depth interviews with 22 people, followed up with half of them, and reviewed their case files. We found that difficulties accessing health care services, payments for medical leave, job reassignments, severance packages, and filing for pension benefits were common to all cases and resulted from overwhelming bureaucratic and administrative demands. Regional and national evaluation bodies dictate whether a given illness or accident is work-related, and establish a percentage of Loss of Wage Earning Capacity (LWEC). People's disabled bodies rarely reached the threshold of 50% LWEC to qualify for disability pensions. The lengthy process that workers were forced to endure to obtain work-related entitlements always involved the judiciary. The three competing for-profit financial sectors (health insurance, pension funds, and Occupational Risk Administrators) actively challenged workers' demands in order to increase their profits. We conclude that these for-profit sectors work contrary to the principles that sustain social security, Indeed, they push sick and disabled workers to unemployment, informality, economic dependence, and ultimately dire poverty.

The research uses stated choice data about preferences for water purchases under different scenarios of deprivation. The economic impacts are estimated as the change in consumer surplus caused by the deprivation. The estimated models show that the social benefits for timely delivery of critical supplies are considerably larger than the market price under normal conditions. The findings suggest that disregarding the effects of deprivation, or incorrectly estimating the economic value of critical supplies such as water, is bound to produce a significant miss-allocation of resources.

This study aimed to analyze the prevalence of MetS according to gender and aging stage, and its association with potential factors in older individuals >= 60 years of age in Colombia. Methods:The data for this study came from a secondary cross-sectional, nationally representative SABE study Survey on Health, Well-Being, and Aging in Colombia, 2015. A total of 1637 participants (60.7% women, 70.5 +/- 7.9 years) from 86 Colombian municipalities participated. A structured questionnaire was used to collect data on socio-demography, lifestyle, and self-report medical conditions. Measurements included anthropometric (weight, waist circumference, body mass index), sarcopenia ""proxy"" status (calf circumference) handgrip strength levels, high-density lipoprotein cholesterol, triglycerides, fasting glucose, and blood pressure. Univariate and multiple regression models were established as part of the main analysis. Results:Using the harmonized Joint Scientific Statement criteria, MetS was present in 54.9% of the study population, with a higher prevalence among females than males (59.8% vs. 47.3%). Individuals who were cigarette smokers (odds ratio [OR] = 1.5; 95% confidence interval [CI] = 1.0-2.4;P = 0.034), female gender (OR = 1.3; 95% CI = 1.0-1.8;P = 0.020), and sarcopenia ""proxy"" (OR = 1.6; 95% CI = 1.0-2.5;P = 0.026) were more likely to have a higher prevalence estimate of MetS, after controlling for relevant covariates. Conclusions:Overall prevalence of MetS among older adults in Colombia is high. Smoking, female gender, and sarcopenia ""proxy"" status are associated with MetS. These results suggested that MetS is still a serious public burden in Colombia, and screening for promotion of healthy lifestyle and nutrition counseling should be offered routinely in old age.",Article,"Barranco-Ruiz, Y.; Villa-Gonzalez, E.; Venegas-Sanabria, L.C.; Chavarro-Carvajal, D.A.; Cano-Gutierrez, C.A.; Izquierdo, M.; Correa-Bautista, J.E.; Gonzalez-Ruiz, K.; Ramirez-Velez, R.",aged; metabolic syndrome; cardiovascular diseases; prevalence,aged;metabolic syndrome;cardiovascular diseases;prevalence;RISK-FACTORS;CARDIOVASCULAR-DISEASE;GENDER-DIFFERENCE;HEALTH;POPULATION;SARCOPENIA;WOMEN;MENOPAUSE;SYMPTOMS,Spain;Colombia,2-s2.0-85092680289

The aim of this study was to determine (i) the detrimental effect of excess adiposity on dependence in activities of daily living (ADL), and (ii) whether relative handgrip strength (HGS) moderates the adverse effect of excess adiposity on dependence, and to provide the threshold of relative HGS from which the adverse effect could be improved or worsened. A total of 4169 participants (69.3 +/- 7.0 years old) from 244 municipalities were selected following a multistage area probability sampling design. Measurements included anthropometric/adiposity markers (weight, height, body mass index, waist circumference, and waist-to-height ratio (WHtR)), HGS, sarcopenia ""proxy"" (calf circumference), and ADL (Barthel Index scale). Moderation analyses were performed to identify associations between the independent variable (WHtR) and outcomes (dependence), as well as to determine whether relative HGS moderates the relationship between excess adiposity and dependence. The present study demonstrated that (i) the adverse effect of having a higher WHtR level on dependence in ADL was moderated by relative HGS, and (ii) two moderation thresholds of relative HGS were estimated: 0.35, below which the adverse effect of WHtR levels on dependency is aggravated, and 0.62, above which the adverse effect of fat on dependency could be improved.

METHODS: We estimated multilevel logistic models using data from the National Demographic and Health Survey in Colombia in 2010. The final sample included 11,448 children under the age of five gathered in 3,528 communities. In addition, we used the Principal Component Analysis with polychoric correlations for the construction of composed indicators of wealth, autonomy of the woman, and the use and access to the health system. RESULTS: The average level of community wealth was significantly and independently associated with chronic malnutrition in early childhood, more than the socioeconomic status of the household itself. At the individual and household level, the probability of chronic malnutrition was higher for children from mothers with low levels of autonomy and use and access to the health system, mothers who had their first child in adolescence, and mothers who live in homes in the lowest wealth quintiles. In contrast, children from mothers with a body mass index > 25 and with at least secondary education (versus no education) were less likely to suffer from chronic malnutrition.

Little evidence exists about this association and its relation with commuting time in Latin America. This study examined the association between time spent traveling in motor vehicles and physical activity levels in the domains of leisure time physical activity and transportation, among Colombian adults in urban areas. A secondary data analysis of the 2010 National Nutrition Survey was conducted. Time spent traveling in motor vehicles and physical activity were assessed using the International Physical Activity Questionnaire. Binary logistic regressions were conducted. Time spent traveling in motor vehicles for 120 minutes or more was reported among 27.6% of the sample. The prevalence of walking and bicycling as a means of transportation for at least 150 minutes per week was 34% and 4.4%, respectively. Achieving at least 150 minutes of leisure time physical activity a week was reported by 18.4% of the sample.

A prospective cohort observational study,"Objective: The aim of this study was to determine the differences in the efficacy and efficiency in providing critical care to hospitalized patients in teaching vs nonteaching intensive care units (ICUs) in Colombia. Methods: A prospective cohort observational study was conducted. Location: This study was conducted in 11 teaching and 8 nonteaching ICUs. From June 1 until December 31, 2005, data on 826 patients admitted consecutively to teaching ICUs and 825 patients admitted to nonteaching ICUs were analyzed. Measurements: Acute Physiology and Chronic Health Evaluation II, Simplified Therapeutic Intervention Scoring System, ICU discharge status (dead or alive) and ICU length of stay, and standardized mortality ratios were considered in this study. A logistic regression and robust linear regression were performed. Results: There were no differences in mortality (P = .25). Standardized mortality was less than 1 for both types of units. The teaching ICUs length of stay was 1 day longer (P < .01). Resource use is 25% higher in teaching units (P = .01). When the Simplified Therapeutic Intervention Scoring System score on the last day was from 21 to 35, a higher ratio of patients from the nonteaching ICUs was observed going floor or home when discharged from the ICU (P < .01).

Considering job satisfaction and mental health as indicators of wellbeing at work, we aim to identify four patterns (i.e., satisfied-healthy, unsatisfied-unhealthy, satisfied-unhealthy, and unsatisfied-healthy) and some of their antecedents. In a sample of 783 young Spanish employees, a two-step cluster analysis procedure showed that the unsatisfied-unhealthy pattern was the most frequent (33%), followed by unsatisfied-healthy (26.6%), satisfied-unhealthy (24.8%) and, finally, the satisfied-healthy pattern (14.3%). Moreover, as hypothesized, discriminant analysis suggests that higher levels of job importance and lower levels of role ambiguity mainly differentiate the satisfied-healthy pattern, whereas overqualification and role overload differentiate, respectively, the unsatisfied-healthy and satisfied-unhealthy patterns. Contrary to our expectations, role conflict also characterizes the satisfied-unhealthy pattern.

Additionally, hyperglycemia, independent of associated comorbidities, is related to the loss of muscle mass and strength, and contributes to functional impairment in older adults. We studied the mediation effect of glucose levels, in the relationship between abdominal obesity and relative handgrip strength (HGS). A total of 1571 participants (60.0% women, mean age 69.1 +/- 7.0 years) from 86 municipalities were selected following a multistage area probability sampling design. Measurements included demographic and anthropometric/adiposity markers (weight, height, body mass index, and waist circumference). HGS was measured using a digital dynamometer for three sets and the mean value was recorded. The values were normalized to body weight (relative HGS). Fasting glucose was analyzed by enzymatic colorimetric methods. Mediation analyses were performed to identify associations between the independent variable (abdominal obesity) and outcomes (relative HGS), as well as to determine whether fasting glucose levels mediated the relationship between excess adiposity and relative HGS. A total of 1239 (78.8%) had abdominal obesity. Abdominal obesity had a negative effect on fasting glucose (beta = 9.04, 95%CI = 5.87 to 12.21); while fasting glucose to relative HGS was inversely related (beta = -0.003, 95%CI = -0.005 to -0.001),p< 0.001. The direct effect of abdominal obesity on relative HGS was statistically significant (beta = -0.069, 95%CI = -0.082 to -0.057),p< 0.001. Lastly, fasting glucose levels mediates the detrimental effect of abdominal obesity on relative HGS (indirect effect beta = -0.002, 95%CI = -0.004 to -0.001),p< 0.001. Our results suggest that the glucose level could worsen the association between abdominal obesity status and lower HGS.

The sustainable diets approach has emerged to address the multidimensional challenge of reaching a context-based diet that minimizes negative environmental impacts, provides health and nutrition to all segments of the population, and is affordable and coherent with the local culture and traditions. The aim of this study was to explore the prospects for meat consumption reduction and challenges encompassing the environmental, and health spheres. In order to do so, we analyzed: (1) The current carbon and water per capita footprints for two animal-based options and two plant-based options; and (2) the contribution of each food alternative to the local dietary reference intakes based on average per capita daily consumption and significant differences among the nutrient values for each food alternative through a two proportion Z-test. Our results show that the annual per capita carbon and water footprints for beef were higher compared to other alternatives, despite a higher per capita consumption of chicken. Also, our findings reveal that the average consumption of beef and chicken contributes 39% of the maximum recommended daily intake for cholesterol and 61% of the Recommended Dietary Allowance for protein in the country.

OBJECTIVE: To conduct an ergonomic intervention to reduce mechanical exposures on workers during manual flower cutting, while emphasizing postural education and reduction of force requirements. PARTICIPANTS: Seventy seven workers (20 to 55 years old; 80% women) from six companies that cultivate roses participated in this study. METHODS: Participants from three companies were randomly assigned to control and intervention groups. A postural education program and a maintenance program was designed and implemented in the intervention group aiming to achieve more neutral postures of the wrist and forearm and to reduce force requirements during rose cutting. Changes in self-reported effort and upper extremity postures, kinematics and muscular activity between baseline and follow-up assessments were evaluated. RESULTS: Most of the observed changes in the evaluated mechanical exposures were moderate for both groups. The intervention group showed differential improvements compared to the control group for 95th percentile forearm pronation (intervention group went from 50.6 to 35.6 degrees; control group went from 18.4 to 34.7 degrees); and to some degree for the maximum wrist radial deviation (the intervention group went from 17 degrees to 7.6 degrees; control group went from 10.1 degrees to 7.8 degrees). Also, the mean elbow flexion for the control group was reduced from 62.3 to 48.4 degrees, whereas it increased from 52.2 to 57.3 degrees in the intervention group. No differential changes between the intervention and control groups were observed for the kinematic variables, except for an unexpected reduction in the 95th percentile velocity of wrist flexion-extension in the control group, which was not observed in the intervention group. Lastly, although observed changes in muscular activity were not statistically significant, improvements were observed for the intervention group for the flexor and extensor carpi radialis and the flexor carpi ulnaris; although the opposite was true for the extensor carpi ulnaris.

A cross-sectional study with a descriptive correlational design was conducted with 269 women who completed a socio-demographic and Clinical Characteristics Questionnaire, an Adherence to Treatment Questionnaire, and a Social Position Survey. Results indicated that approximately one out of two (43%) of the participants presented low adherence to treatment and that higher levels of adherence were associated with higher scores in the Social Position Survey. All variables in the ""barriers and living conditions"" dimension were associated with social position of the participants. Women with a middle or high social position had more favorable living conditions and less barriers for access and showed higher adherence to treatment in comparison with women with a low social position. Additionally, they showed better adherence ""practices"". Meanwhile, in the ""beliefs"" dimension, both groups showed similar trends.

One such strategy is a volunteering scheme, referred to as befriending, which seeks to support the social integration of patients. Despite positive reports in other world regions, this intervention has not been studied in Latin America. Whilst befriending programmes commonly form patient-volunteer dyads, group arrangements may be an alternative with some benefits. Here, we aim to explore the feasibility, experiences and outcomes of a group volunteer befriending intervention for patients with severe mental illness in Colombia. Methods In this exploratory non-controlled study, 10 groups of five individuals were formed, each consisting of three individuals with schizophrenia or bipolar disorder and two volunteers from the community in Bogota, Colombia. Each group was encouraged to participate together in social activities within their community over a 6-month period. Patients' quality of life, objective social outcomes, symptom levels and internalised stigma were assessed before and after the intervention. Patients' and volunteers' experiences were explored in semi-structured interviews which were analysed using inductive content analysis. Results Outcomes were available for 23 patients. Whilst their objective social situation had significantly improved at the end of the intervention, other outcomes did not show statistically significant differences. The interviews with participants revealed positive experiences which fell into five categories: 1) stigma reduction; 2) personal growth; 3) formation of relationships; 4) continuity and sustainability of befriending; 5) acceptability and feasibility of befriending. Conclusions A volunteer befriending programme in small groups of two volunteers and three patients is feasible and associated with positive experiences of participants. Such programmes may also improve the objective social situation of patients. This low-cost intervention may be useful for patients with severe mental illnesses in Latin America.",Article,"Botero-Rodriguez, F.; Hernandez, M.C.; Uribe-Restrepo, J.M.; Cabariqe, C.; Fung, C.; Priebe, S.; Gomez-Restrepo, C.",Global mental health; Severe mental illness; Community mental health; Befriending; Volunteers,Global mental health;Severe mental illness;Community mental health;Befriending;Volunteers;HEALTH;PEOPLE;MOTIVATIONS;SUPPORT,Colombia;United Kingdom,2-s2.0-85105200928

The project was developed in collaboration with a public healthcare network comprised of 38 urban and rural centers with women between the ages of 25 and 65 years, healthcare providers of the cancer program, healthcare administrators and the general manager of said network. Our HCD process involved five stages: research, need synthesis, ideation and co-design process, prototyping and in-context usability testing. In practice, some of the stages are overlapped and iterated throughout the design process. We conducted observations, open-ended interviews and conversations, multi-stakeholder workshops, focus groups, systematic text condensation analyses and tests in real contexts. As a result, we designed four prototypes: (1) 'Encanto': An educational manicure service, (2) 'No le des la espalda a la citologia': A media-based strategy, (3) An educational wireless queuing device in the waiting room, and (4) Citobot: A cervical cancer early detection device, system, and method. The tests carried out with each prototype showed their value, limitations and possibilities in terms of subsequent development and validation through public health research or clinical research. We recognize that a longer-term evaluation is required in order to determine whether the prototypes will be used regularly, integrated into cervical cancer screening services and effectively improve access to cytology as a screening test. We conclude that HCD is a useful for design-based prevention in the field of cervical cancer. The integration of this approach with public health research would allow the generation of evidence during to the formulation of policies and programs as well as optimize existing interventions and, ultimately, facilitate the scalability and financing of what actually works.",Article,"Arrivillaga, M.; Bermudez, P.C.; Garcia-Cifuentes, J.P.; Botero, J.",,HUMAN-PAPILLOMAVIRUS;SCREENING-PROGRAMS;PROMOTION PROGRAM;VAGINAL SPECULUM;HEALTH;THINKING;COMMUNITY;BREAST;EXPERIENCES;BARRIERS,Colombia,2-s2.0-85089925615

Methods: We conducted a rapid review of the literature that addressed 2 exploratory research questions. A systematic and exhaustive search was carried out up to July 2018 in MEDLINE (Ovid), Embase, Scopus, and Web of Science. Results: The concepts of TV and VBP are related; value frameworks for medicines should include social preferences, comparative effectiveness, safety, adoption viability, social impact, high quality of evidence, severity of illness, and innovation. The added therapeutic value (ATV) is the manner of measuring the therapeutic advantages of new medicines compared with existing ones in terms of comparative effectiveness and safety. There are variations in the mechanisms of reimbursement and drug pricing regulation between the countries of study. Conclusion: In a VBP system it is essential to establish the TV and ATV of a new medicine. Although there are no methodological guidelines for the implementation of VBP policies, the process implies from the beginning the definition of TV categories that will be included in the drug pricing and reimbursement systems.

Using qualitative and quantitative methodologies, we characterized the socioenvironmental context of El Tiple in terms of ethnography, autoethnography, social cartography, and ethnobotany. We implemented a participatory approach to codevelop a technology-assisted strategy for strengthening the community's small-scale farming activities. Our contextual analysis results show systemic food dispossession, which arises from several factors, including dramatic land transformation, rapid depletion and contamination of natural assets, and biodiversity loss. All these factors are associated with the presence of bordering sugarcane plantations. In collaboration with community members, we designed, constructed, and analyzed a greenhouse hydroponic cultivation system as an actionable means to gradually restore local production of food and medicinal plants for the community.

Decreased functioning is linked to lower performance, predominantly regarding instrumental activities of daily living (IADLs). The present study aims to explore the association between hearing loss and impairment in IADLs. Methods: This is a secondary analysis of The Health, Well-Being, and Aging Colombia study, performed in 2015. Participants were classified into three groups: 1) without hearing loss, 2) hearing loss corrected through the use of a hearing aid, and 3) hearing loss without a hearing aid. Bivariate and adjusted multivariate analyses were performed. The measured outcome was IADLs. Results and discussion: Information from a total of 23,694 community-dwelling Colombian older adults (age >= 60 years) was used. The prevalence of hearing impairment was 23.4%, 1.8% out of those reported the use of hearing aids. Independent associations were found for having impaired IADLs when comparing participants with hearing loss without a hearing aid and those with normal hearing. However, there was no statistical significance with respect to IADLs when comparing hearing loss corrected by hearing aids versus participants with normal hearing. Participants using hearing aids have better functioning evaluated by IADLs when compared with participants with hearing impairment and no hearing aids.

There are relatively few studies that explore the effect of accelerometer-determined moderate-to-vigorous physical activity (MVPA) on neck circumference (NC), most of them confined to single high-income countries. The present study investigated the association of accelerometer-determined MVPA with NC in adolescents and adults from eight Latin American countries, which are mostly upper-middle income countries.MethodsThe sample consisted of 2370 participants (47.8% male) from the Latin American Study of Nutrition and Health, a multicenter cross-sectional nutrition and health surveillance study of a nationally representative sample from eight Latin American countries (Argentina, Brazil, Chile, Colombia, Costa Rica, Ecuador, Peru, and Venezuela). Times (min/day) in MVPA (defined as time accumulated at 1952 activity counts/min) was assessed by ActiGraph GT3X+ accelerometer over 7days. NC for adolescent was categorized as abnormal if circumference was >34.5cm for boys and>31.25 for girls, whereas for adults the cut-off points for abnormal were>39cm for men and>35cm women. Multilevel logistic models, including country and region as random effects and adjusted for sex, age, socioeconomic level, and educational level, were used to study the association between MVPA and NC.ResultsThe average time of MVPA was 34.88min/day, ranging from 31.16 in Venezuela to 40.27 in Chile. Concerning NC, 37.0% of the sample was classified as having elevated NC. Chile was the country with the highest percentage of people with elevated NC (56.9%), and Colombia had the lowest percentage (24.8%). Overall, the MVPA (min/day) was associated with elevated NC (OR=0.994, CI95%=0.990-0.998). In Costa Rica and Peru, there were significant associations between MVPA and NC when analyzed by country.ConclusionsThe present study provided evidence of significant associations between MVPA and NC in adolescents and adults from Latin America, independent of sex, age, socioeconomic level, and educational level. This analysis of accelerometry data and NC represents the first examination of these associations in eight Latin America countries. Further research is required to understand the differences between countries in the observed associations.Trial registrationClinicalTrials.Gov NCT02226627.

Evidence from Costa Rica,"The estimated benefits of malaria eradication have been very different in terms of human capital accumulation. This paper quantifies the impact of malaria eradication in Costa Rica and explores whether precampaign regional characteristics can improve or damage the benefits of a health campaign. There are several results. First, using difference in differences I find that years of education of men and women increased in response to the eradication campaign but that only wages of males increased. Results are robust. Second, worse conditions in the school system and more child employment displaced schooling. Hence, health benefits may not translate into educational gains when the school system characteristics are bad or when the child labor market provides a better investment opportunity than schooling. Third, combining empirical evidence with a simple model, the increase in schooling cannot solely explain the increase in the income of men; however, health improvements explain most of the increase. Finally, the point estimates show that human capital gains were almost completely eliminated when a shortage of funding for eradication led to a resurgence of malaria; this emphasizes the fragility of the estimated benefits.",Article,"Mora-Garcia, C.A.",,SOUTH-AFRICA;EXPOSURE;IMPACT;CHILDHOOD;EDUCATION;DISEASE;GENDER;HEALTH;LABOR,Colombia,2-s2.0-85043531092;2-s2.0-85043531092

In Colombia, its prevalence is 25% with a high mortality rate. The psychosocial factors affecting pharmacological adherence among patients have not been sufficiently studied and despite international evidence on their impact, in Colombia, there is a paucity of research on the role of chronic stress in the relationship between socioeconomic status and pharmacological adherence. Objective: To examine the role of chronic stress in the relationship between socioeconomic status and pharmacological adherence in hypertensive patients aged 45 to 70 years old in three Colombian cities between 2015 and 2016. Materials and methods: We conducted a cross-sectional study in a population of hypertensive patients. Data for this study came from the first wave of longitudinal study aimed at examining social factors associated with the control of hypertension in Bogota, Medellin, and Quibdo. Patients with hypertension were selected randomly from a sample of those participating in the hypertension control program De todo corazon. For the statistical analysis of the data, we used factorial analysis and multivariate regressions. Results: We found a positive association between socioeconomic status and the degree of pharmacological adherence and a negative one with chronic stress. Besides, evidence was found that stress has a negative association with the degree of adherence.

Accordingly, gait speed could be a factor that improves or worsens the relationship between obesity and dependence in activities of daily living (ADL). However, to date this potential role has not been examined and the minimum gait speed threshold in the relationship between obesity and ADL is not known. The aim of this study was to determine whether speed moderates the association between obesity and dependence in ADL, and also define the gait speed threshold of this relationship. Methods: A total of 20,507 community-dwelling older adults from a cross-sectional analysis of national survey data - the Colombian Health, Well-being and Aging study (SABE, 2015) - were surveyed. The research data were collected using structured questionnaires, including basic information, ADL measured using the Barthel Index, body mass index, and gait speed (3 m). The Johnson-Neyman technique was applied to determine the gait speed threshold adjusted for age, sex and comorbidities. Results: Regression analysis showed a significant detrimental effect of obesity on dependence in ADL, which was moderated by gait speed (beta = 0.081; 95%CI: 0.045 to 0.117; p < 0.001). Adjusted for major covariates, the Johnson-Neyman technique defined two gait speed thresholds: < 0.77 m/s, indicating an aggravated adverse effect; and > 1.06 m/s, indicating a positive effect. Conclusions: The adverse effect of obesity on dependence in ADL is moderated by gait speed. Considering these thresholds, the distribution of older adults in each of the proposed areas of significance were: below 0.77 (m/s) = 14,324 (70.0%), above 1.06 (m/s) = 1553 older adults (7.5%) and between areas = 4630 older adults (22.5%).",Article,"Ramirez-Velez, R.; Perez-Sousa, M.A.; Venegas-Sanabria, L.C.; Chavarro-Carvajal, D.A.; Cano-Gutierrez, C.A.; Correa-Bautista, J.E.; Gonzalez-Ruiz, K.; Izquierdo, M.",Gait speed; Obesity; Dependence; Latin-American; Elderly,Gait speed;Obesity;Dependence;Latin-American;Elderly;INCIDENT DISABILITY;WALKING SPEED;MORTALITY;STRENGTH;DECLINE;PERFORMANCE;WEIGHT;PEOPLE;HEALTH;RISK,Spain;Colombia,

One of its beneficial features is the production of bacteriocins, which inhibit the growth of cariogenic bacteria, and another is its buffering capacity through the production of ammonium from arginine. The purpose of this study was to determine the presence of S. dentisani in the dental plaque of Colombian children and whether the presence of this bacterium is related to oral health and other conditions. Dental plaque and information on diet and oral hygiene habits were collected from children between 6 and 12 years of age from four Colombian cities, divided into caries-free children (International Caries Detection and Assessment System [ICDAS] 0, Decayed Missing Filled Teeth index [DMFT] 0), children with ICDAS 1 and 2, and children with ICDAS >3. Plaque DNA was extracted and quantified, and real-time polymerase chain reaction was performed using specific primers. This bacterium was identified in all samples, with a median of 0.46 cells/ng DNA (interquartile range [IQR] 0.13-1.02), without finding significant differences between the groups (P > 0.05). In caries-free children, a median of 0.45 cells/ng DNA (IQR 0.14-1.23) was found. In children with ICDAS 1 and 2, the median was 0.49 cells/ng DNA (IQR 0.11-0.97), and in children with ICDAS >3, the median was 0.35 cells/ng DNA (IQR 0.12-1.07). However, statistically significant differences were found in the origin of children (P < 0.01), the use of fluoride-containing products (P < 0.01), and the frequency of food intake (P < 0.05).

Methods: A cross-sectional study was conducted among 1742 people with type 2 diabetes attending diabetes clinics in London, Ontario, Canada, and Bogota, Colombia. The data were extracted from the Global Registry and Surveillance System for Diabetes (GRAND). Results: Canadian patients were diagnosed with diabetes at significantly younger ages than Colombian patients (49 years and 53 years, respectively) and were heavier (body mass indices of 33 and 28, respectively). The Colombian patient population had significantly higher mean glycated hemoglobin (A1C) levels (9.4% vs. 8.6%) and fewer patients (22% vs. 26%) at the glycemic target (A1C <7.0%) than Canadian patients. In Colombia, 1 or more diabetes-related complications were present in 51% of the study population compared with 37% in Canada. Newly diagnosed Colombians had higher mean A1C levels (9.1% vs. 8.7%) and low-density lipoprotein-C levels (3.3 mmol/L vs. 2.5 mmol/L) than did newly diagnosed Canadians.

Design: Nutritional information was obtained for all foods and beverages advertised and used to categorise each product according to the product category (e.g. beverage, snack food) and nutritional quality based on the PAHO model for identifying products in excess of free sugars, Na or saturated fat or containing non-caloric sweeteners or trans-fat. Television audience ratings data were used to derive the average child audience (unique child viewers) per ad and the number of times ads were seen by children in a single week (weekly impressions) based on product category and nutritional quality. Setting: All food and beverage ads on cable and over-the-air TV in Colombia in 2017. Participants: N/A. Results: Of all instances of TV ads, 89 center dot 3 % were of unhealthy products. A larger proportion of male and female children, as well as children from low (88 center dot 01 %), mid (89 center dot 10 %) and high (89 center dot 10 %) socio-economic status, are exposed to advertising of unhealthy products, but no significant difference was found between these proportions. Conclusion: The majority of foods and beverages advertised to Colombian children are unhealthy.

Socioeconomic Determinants of the Stunting Urban-Rural Gap for Children in Colombia,"Stunting (low height for age) is a crucial indicator for measuring child well-being and economic and social development of a country. Despite a decrease in overall children's stunting in the last decades, there are still significant geographic disparities between urban and rural areas in Colombia. This paper aims to identify the role of the main determinants of children's stunting in explaining the urban-rural stunting gap. We use data from the 2015 National Nutritional Situation Survey (the most recent available dataset) and the Yun's statistical decomposition technique. We find that the urban-rural gap in child stunting is 7.2 percentage points. Three determinants: household wealth, maternal education, and health services utilization, explain most of the gap (92%). Each determinant explains 54%, 26%, and 12% of the characteristics effect, respectively.

OBJECTIVE: This study examined whether cognitive dysfunction and social disadaptation in individuals with TBI in Latin America at hospital discharge predict longitudinal trajectories of depression at baseline, 2 months, and 4 months. METHODS: A sample of 109 people with a new TBI was recruited from three hospitals: Mexico City, Mexico, Cali, Colombia and Neiva, Colombia. Participants completed measures of cognitive dysfunction and social disadaptation before hospital discharge and measures of depression at baseline, 2 months, and 4 months. RESULTS: Results suggested that depression scores were found to decrease over time in a quadratic (or U-shaped) fashion, and more significant cognitive dysfunction at hospital discharge was associated with higher longitudinal depression trajectories. Social disadaptation did not exert a unique effect on depression trajectories after controlling for cognitive dysfunction. Depression trajectories changed differentially over time as a function of baseline cognitive dysfunction, such that for those with high cognitive impairment, depression scores started high and then dropped to a moderated range and plateaued, but for individuals with low cognitive dysfunction, depression scores started lower and decreased linearly but moderately. CONCLUSIONS: The results suggest a strong need for neuropsychological assessments and evidence-based cognitive rehabilitation strategies to be implemented immediately after TBI in Latin America, which could exert salubrious effects on depression trajectories over time.",Article,"Cariello, A.N.; Perrin, P.B.; Agudelo, Y.R.; Plaza, S.L.O.; Quijano-Martinez, M.C.; Trujillo, M.A.; Arango-Lasprilla, J.C.",Traumatic brain injury; caregivers; depression; Latin America; rehabilitation,Traumatic brain injury;caregivers;depression;Latin America;rehabilitation;QUALITY-OF-LIFE;QUESTIONNAIRE EBIQ;BEHAVIOR;HEALTH;MODEL;INDIVIDUALS;MILD;IMPAIRMENT,United States;Mexico;Colombia;Spain,2-s2.0-85083312401;2-s2.0-85083312401

A protocol for a prospective cohort study,"Introduction Improving the mental health of young people is a global public health priority. In Latin America, young people living in deprived urban areas face various risk factors for mental distress. However, most either do not develop mental distress in the form of depression and anxiety, or recover within a year without treatment from mental health services. This research programme seeks to identify the personal and social resources that help young people to prevent and recover from mental distress. Methods and analysis A cross-sectional study will compare personal and social resources used by 1020 young people (aged 15-16 and 20-24 years) with symptoms of depression and/or anxiety and 1020 without. A longitudinal cohort study will follow-up young people with mental distress after 6 months and 1 year and compare resource use in those who do and do not recover. An experience sampling method study will intensively assess activities, experiences and mental distress in subgroups over short time periods. Finally, we will develop case studies highlighting existing initiatives that effectively support young people to prevent and recover from mental distress. The analysis will assess differences between young people with and without distress at baseline using t-tests and chi(2) tests. Within the groups with mental distress, multivariate logistic regression analyses using a random effects model will assess the relationship between predictor variables and recovery.

Method: Single-stage descriptive correlational cross-sectional design. An anonymous online questionnaire was administered to 100 Colombian trans women. The results were obtained using both frequentist and bayesian (a priori-a posteriori) statistical methods. Results: About three-quarters of the participating women reported a high level of adherence to preventive behaviors. Associated factors were feeling able to implement the preventive actions and believing in their effectiveness, to avoid infecting others, conflicts with others, and avoiding legal problems. Conclusions: Self-efficacy and rule-governed behaviors are related to adherence to prevention measures. Addressing adherence in times of COVID-19 implies comprehensively incorporating the magnitude of social inequities and injustices and the health responses to a situation that affects humanity in a diverse and differentiated manner.

Meta analyses of genome-wide expression studies (GWES) might contribute to identify gene expression patterns and to a better understanding of the molecular mechanisms behind the complexity of adaptations to exercise, under a systems biology approach. Here, we aimed to analyze available data for human GWES that have evaluated the effect of exhaustive exercise in peripheral blood mononuclear cells (PBMC) and white blood cells (WBC). Three primary datasets retrieved from the NCBI Gene Expression Omnibus were meta-analyzed using a random effects model in the NetworkAnalyst software. After identifying nine differentially expressed genes (DEGs), we performed functional enrichment analyses to extract relevant biological information. A protein-protein interactions network on DEGs was built to evaluate the associated regulatory pathways. We found that five upregulated genes were members of the heat shock protein family, one of the top stress-response groups of genes. The enrichment analysis revealed key roles of the DEGs on the cellular adaptations to exercise-induced stress (i.e., temperature stimulus, topologically-incorrect and unfolded proteins). Our comparison analysis of DEG signatures found in blood cells with the expression pattern on muscle skeletal tissue showed some common genes. Thus, novel DEGs that might serve as hormetic mediators to exercise-induced adaptations were identified. Further experimental research is needed to validate these findings.",Article,"Orozco, C.A.; Gonzalez-Giraldo, Y.; Bonilla, D.A.; Forero, D.A.",Physiological adaptation; Systems biology; Bioinformatics; Blood cells; Transcriptomics,Physiological adaptation;Systems biology;Bioinformatics;Blood cells;Transcriptomics;PHYSICAL-ACTIVITY;GENE-EXPRESSION;MUSCLE;ADAPTATIONS;HEALTH;BDNF,Colombia;Spain,

Aim: To determine the prevalence of FSD/ED and its association with LUTS in Colombia. Methods: Sub-analysis of a cross-sectional, population-based study conducted in subjects >= 18 years old to evaluate LUTS/OAB. The estimated sample size was 1,054. ED was defined as <= 21 points in the SHIM and FSD as <= 19 in the FSFI-6. For LUTS/OAB, we used the 2002 ICS and 2010 IUGA/ICS definitions and validated questionnaires. Descriptive and inferential statistics were employed. Outcomes: Prevalence of FSD/ED and association of FSD/ED and LUTS. Results: We included 1,060 participants; the median age was 40 (IQR 27-54) years. Fifty-seven (11.4%) men and 182 (32.7%) women were sexually inactive. The prevalence of FSD/ED in sexually active participants was 47% (men 52.9%, women 38.9%). The most common FSD/ED symptoms were diminished/absent lubrication in women (42%) and diminished erection maintenance after penetration in men (13%). Individuals with FSD/ED had higher rates of various LUTS. The multivariable logistic regression model found that the city of residence (OR = 0.4, 95% CI 0.2-0.9), diabetes mellitus (DM) (OR = 8.4, 95% CI 1.4-48.7), menopause (OR=3.5, 95% CI 1.9-6.2), urge urinary incontinence (UUI) (OR=1.9, 95% CI 1.1-3.3) and nocturia >= 2 (OR = 2.2, 95% CI 1.2-4.2) were associated with FSD. In men, age 40-59 (OR = 2.3, 95% CI 1.4-3.7) and >= 60 (OR = 5.5, 95% CI 2.4-12.5), the city of residence (OR = 0.2, 95% CI 0.1-0.3), less than a high-school diploma vs higher education (OR = 2.0, 95% CI 1.2-3.2), depression (OR = 4.6, 95% CI 1.8-11.5), UUI (OR = 3.2, 95% CI 1.1 -10.2) and feeling of incomplete bladder emptying (OR = 2.1, 95% CI 1.3-3.5) were associated with ED. Clinical Implications: This study underlines the importance of assessing LUTS in women and men of all affected age groups who present with symptoms of FSD/ED and vice versa, which could help achieve a better approach for these patients. Strengths & Limitations: This is the first study in Colombia and one of the few in Latin America that addresses both FSD/ED and LUTS in men and women aged 18 years and older. Limitations include being a sub-analysis of a study aiming to determine the prevalence of LUTS/OAB and not FSD/ED. Conclusions: Regardless of age, LUTS were observed more frequently in patients with FSD/ED. Various LUTS were associated with FSD/ED. Copyright (C) 2021, International Society of Sexual Medicine.

Design We conducted a multicentre cross-sectional study to collect physical activity and built environment data. The levels of physical activity were calculated through the International Physical Activity Questionnaire survey. Using the Neighbourhood Environment Walkability Scale-Abbreviated, characteristics of the built environment were measured through three domains: accessibility, microinfrastructure and security. To estimate the association of the built environment and physical activity, we used mixed effects logistic regression analysis. In addition, likelihood ratio test to account for clustered effect within countries and/or cities was used. Setting Eight countries in LA. Participants Adults aged 15-65 years (n=9218) living in urban areas and consented to participate of the Latin American Study of Nutrition and Health. Results Most of the population in LA had access to a grocery store (97.2%), public transport stop (91.5%) and children's playground (81.6%). Metropolitan parks were more accessible in Ecuador (59.8%) and Colombia (59.2%) than in Venezuela (33.5%). Individuals located within 20 min of walking from sport facilities or children's playground areas were more likely to perform moderate-to-high physical activity OR 1.20 (95% CI 1.06 to 1.36) and OR 1.25 (95% CI 1.02 to 1.53), respectively. Only 14.5% of the population from the region considered that their neighbourhood had an adequate design for walking or cycling. Likewise, among adults living in LA, only 39.75% had the perception of living in a safe neighbourhood. Conclusions This multicentre study shows that currently, LA built environment does not promote physical activity in the region.

This study aimed to assess, in a population of patients with DM2, discharged from a tertiary referral hospital, whether treatment based on the use of an mHealth application was associated with better glycemic control at the 3-month follow-up, than standard care. Methods: This open, randomized, controlled clinical trial included adult DM2 patients who were transitioning from inpatient to outpatient care. The efficacy and safety of patient management with and without mHealth was compared at the 3-month follow-up. The primary outcome was the change in the Glycosylated hemoglobin (HbA1c) levels. The secondary outcomes were the rates of hypoglycemic and hyperglycemic events and treatment satisfaction measured using the Insulin Treatment Satisfaction Questionnaire (ITSQ). Results: In total, 86 patients (41 using mHealth) were included in the clinical trial. HbA1c levels showed a significant decrease in both groups. The mean HbA1c level was significantly lower in the mHealth group. Patients using mHealth showed decreased incidence rate ratios of hypoglycemia 3.0 mmol/L [<54 mg/dl], hypoglycemia ranging from 3.0 to 3.8 mmol/L [54 to 70 mg/dl] and severe hypoglycemia.

Unfortunately, they have an equivalent or even greater risk for multiple harmful health outcomes when compared with conventional cigarettes. Nevertheless, these devices are perceived less harmful or addictive, and are more socially accepted. Additionally, most users belong to the teenage population, which is characterized by greater vulnerability due to the ongoing neurodevelopment process.

This, in addition to metabolic effects, makes it difficult to assess the real state of individual energy balance. This study aims to analyze the energy gaps between intake and expenditure in the adult population of Latin America, as well as its relationships with sociodemographic variables and nutrition status, to draw an epidemiological perspective based on the trends observed. The energy imbalance gap was used to this end. The difference between energy intake and expenditure can be applied as a reference to explain whether weight equilibrium can prevent weight gain. Moreover, the energy imbalance gap allows for a better understanding of the design of public health policies. Using data from the Latin American Study of Nutrition and Health, the energy imbalance gap in adult population from eight Latin-American countries was assessed in 5994 subjects aged from 19-65. Usual dietary intake was measured using two non-consecutive 24 h dietary recalls. The sociodemographic questionnaire was supplemented by anthropometric measurements. Physical activity was measured through the long International Physical Activity Questionnaire. Energy expenditure was obtained using the basal metabolic rate. For the overall sample, the mean energy intake was 1939.1 kcal (95% CI: 1926.9; 1951.3), the mean of energy expenditure was 1915.7 kcal (95% CI: 1906.4; 1924.9), and the mean of energy imbalance gap was 23.4 kcal (95% CI: 11.9; 35.0). Results show that energy intake and expenditure were higher in men. Moreover, subjects aged 19-34, of high socioeconomic level, who completed high school, were mestizos and were of normal weight consumed the highest number of calories. Overall, a positive energy imbalance gap was observed. Overweight and obese from Argentina, Costa Rica, Ecuador, Peru, and Venezuela showed a significantly lower energy imbalance gap than underweight subjects.

Objective: To explore the relation between sociodemographic, medical and psychological factors with the incidence of functional status decline in Mexican older adults. Materials and methods: Data from the 2012 and 2015 waves of the Mexican Health and Aging Study (MHAS) survey was analyzed. Participants with previous functional status decline at baseline were excluded. We assessed functional status decline individually with activities of daily living (ADLs) and instrumental ADLs (IADLs) in an individual way. Results: Age was associated with functional limitation in ADLs. Male sex had an association with limitations for IADLs. A poor financial situation and lower education related to higher limitations for ADLs. Furthermore, pain, comorbidities and depression were found to be independently associated with limitations in ADLs. IADLs limitation was associated with age, poor education, comorbidities, depression as well as cognitive impairment. Conclusions We found that factors such as age, financial status, educational level, pain and the number of comorbidities were associated with the incidence of functional status decline. Pain had a greater association in the 3-year functional ADLs decline incidence when compared with cognitive impairment.

Design A multimethod, qualitative study with 18 online focus groups and 12 online structured group conversations embedded into arts workshops. Setting This study was conducted in Bogota (Colombia), Buenos Aires (Argentina) and Lima (Peru). Participants Adolescents (15-16 years old) and young adults (20-24 years old) with capacity to provide assent/consent and professionals (older than 18 years of age) that had experience of professionally working with young people were willing to share personal experience within a group, and had capacity to provide consent. Results A total of 185 participants took part in this study: 111 participants (36 adolescents, 35 young adults and 40 professionals) attended the 18 focus groups and 74 young people (29 adolescents and 45 young adults) took part in the 12 arts workshops. Eight categories captured the resources and activities that were reported by young people as helpful to overcome mental distress: (1) personal resources, (2) personal development, (3) spirituality and religion, (4) social resources, (5) social media, (6) community resources, (7) activities (subcategorised into artistic, leisure, sports and outdoor activities) and (8) mental health professionals. Personal and social resources as well as artistic activities and sports were the most common resources identified that help adolescents and young adults to overcome depression and anxiety. Conclusion Despite the different contexts of the three cities, young people appear to use similar resources to overcome mental distress.

,,,0,WOS:000766517900001,2022,Muscular Function as an Alternative to Identify Cognitive Impairment: A Secondary Analysis From SABE Colombia,"BackgroundIdentification of cognitive impairment is based traditionally on the neuropsychological tests and biomarkers that are not available widely. This study aimed to establish the association between motor function (gait speed and handgrip strength) and cognitive performance in the Mini-Mental State Examination, globally and by domains. A secondary goal was calculating a cut-off point for gait speed and handgrip strength to classify older adults as cognitively impaired. MethodsThis is a secondary analysis of SABE Colombia (Salud, Bienestar & Envejecimiento), a survey that was conducted in 2015 on health, wellbeing, and aging in Colombia. This study used linear regression models to search for an association between motor function and cognitive performance. The accuracy of motor function measurements in identifying cognitive impairment was assessed with receiver operating characteristic (ROC) curves. This study also analyzed other clinical and sociodemographical variables. ResultsGait speed was associated with orientation (r(2) = 0.16), language (r(2) = 0.15), recall memory (r(2) = 0.14), and counting (r(2) = 0.08). Similarly, handgrip strength was associated with orientation (r(2) = 0.175), language (r(2) = 0.164), recall memory (r(2) = 0.137), and counting (r(2) = 0.08). To differentiate older adults with and without cognitive impairment, a gait speed cut-off point of 0.59 m/s had an area under the curve (AUC) of 0.629 (0.613-0.646), and a weak handgrip (strength below 17.5 kg) had an AUC of 0.653 (0.645-0.661). The cut-off points for handgrip strength and gait speed were significantly higher in male participants. ConclusionsGait speed and handgrip strength are similarly associated with the cognitive performance, exhibiting the most extensive association with orientation and language domains of the Mini-Mental State Examination.

We examined the relationship between socio-demographic correlates and HDI with physical activity and sedentary time in a cross-sectional study. Methods: We based our analyses on 2522 (53.1% women; 18-65 years [mean age 38.3 years]) adults drawn from the eight Latin America countries. Physical activity (light, moderate, vigorous, and moderate-to-vigorous intensity and steps) and sedentary time were assessed using Actigraph GT3X+ accelerometers. Sex, age, and race/ethnicity were self-reported. The HDI country information was obtained from the United Nations Development Program. Results: For the age, ethnicity, vigorous physical activity and steps/day, there were significant differences between high and very high HDI countries. Women and younger age presented lower sedentary time than men and older. In moderate-to-vigorous physical activity, we found lower duration in women (-13.4 min/week), younger age (-0.1 min/ week), and white/caucasian (-2.7 min/week) than men, older ages and mixed ethnicity. Women (-1266.5 steps/week) and very high HDI (-847.3 steps/week) presented lower steps than men and high HDI. Black (2853.9 steps/week), other (1785.4 steps/week), and white/caucasian ethnicity (660.6 steps/week) showed higher steps than mixed ethnicity.

,,,0,WOS:000697021500006,2021,Resilience factors and familiar well-being in Colombian families,"Currently, modern families are coping with different stressful situations. The family studies are focused on the conceptual perspective, political perspective and methodological topic and they leave aside the familiar dynamics and functioning. This paper was interested in describing and comparing indicators of family resilience and family welfare of 442 Colombian families. This study had three hypotheses: The first one is focused on differences in well-being family dimension per location; the second hypothesis was focused on significant differences in family resilience per location, and the third one was interested in significant relations in family resilience and family well-being. The theoretical support to this research is the McCubbin and Patterson's resilience model called Double ABCX and Family Adaptation and Adjust Response Model by Patterson. The family well-being is considered a result of internal family functioning and is measured by the family member perception about the concern about health problems, fears, anger and sadness. Family resilience is understood as the capacity to recover from adversity. This capacity strengthens families and improves their resources. In this theoretic resilience approach the resilience is a dynamic result to the adaptation phase and the family well-being is the final adjustment. The design was cross-sectional analytical with a convenience sample. The families were interviewed in their homes, from each family both parents and a child between 9 and 17 years old participated. They are located geographically in Bogota (n = 196), Santa Marta (n = 81) and Cali-Palmira (n = 145). Families completed the Family Member Wellbeing Index (FMWB) and the Family Regeneration and Adaptation Index (FIRA-G) to assess resilience. Families residing in Bogota showed significant differences with those of Cali-Palmira in the dimension of family wellbeing, family stress and support from friends and family. While families located in Santa Marta showed differences with respect to the families located in Cali-Palmira in family stress and in community and social support. The father correlations between the family resilience index and the well-being family index is strong and inverse with the family stress and the family well-being summarized. The mother well-being family perception is significant associated with family resilience, and these correlations was strongest with family well-being summarized. The family stress index, strains and distress exposed moderate and inverse relations with the posi-tive resilience family summarized. The discussion deals with family resilience as a product of the dynamic interaction in the hole family system and is oriented to the fact that the presence of support from family and friends reduces the burden of family stress, promotes support in the face of crisis and, in general, improves the well-being and family adaptation. In general, the differences reflect varied resilience trajectories that depend on the challenges posed by the close context of the city where they live. An approach to this result leads us to think as a hypothesis not yet widely explored, in the mobility factor of cities, which limits contact with close family networks. In big cities like Bogota, its internal mobility compromises the times and spaces of daily life, and thus allows or prevents fami-lies from organizing their relationships in the different areas of their social life. Resil-ience occurs through positive adaptive family resources that included social support and family coherence and allow families to reduce stress and meet the demands of the environ-ment. On the other hand, the presence of the two parents in families without clinical indi-cators shows that the burden of shared stress helps family resilience, which is also fed by the presence of external aids to the family nucleus, such as the support of the commu-and friends.",Article,"Rojas, M.R.; Ceballos, E.C.; Bermudez-Jaimes, M.E.; Blanco, O.A.C.; Sanchez, J.E.; Jimenez, J.C.; Moreno, M.R.",family resilience; family well-being; family functioning; family relationships; family stress; social support,family resilience;family well-being;family functioning;family relationships;family stress;social support;PARENTAL STRESS;HEALTH;CHILD;SUPPORT,Colombia,

Our study aimed to describe lower-body muscle power in older individuals aged >= 60 years and examine the relationship of muscle weakness with adverse events according to gender- and age-specific muscle weakness cut-off points. A total of 3689 Colombian older adults (57.6% women, age 69.1 +/- 6.9 years) from the 2015 Survey on Health, Well-Being, and Aging in Latin America and the Caribbean (SABE) participated in this study. Lower-body muscle power normalized to body mass was estimated by the five-repetitions STS test. Anthropometric, physical performance and clinical characteristics were collected. Age-specific percentiles using the LMS method, cut-off points and association with adverse events were calculated. Lower-body muscle power was greater in men than among women (2.2 +/- 0.7 vs. 1.6 +/- 0.5 W center dot kg(-1), respectively; p < 0.001) at all ages. Muscle power ranked in the 50th percentile between 2.38 and 1.30 W center dot kg(-1) in men, whereas women ranked between 1.79 and 1.21 W center dot kg(-1). According to the cut-off points, lower-limb muscle power < 1 standard deviation in men was associated with having dynapenia, poor gait speed, cognitive impairment and mental, visual, hearing and memory problems. While, women were associated with having sarcopenia, dynapenia, poor gait speed, cognitive impairment, mental, hearing and memory problems, dementia and hospitalizations of > 24 h in the last year.

An assessment of the reliability, comprehensiveness, and quality of information uploaded to SoMe for Spanish-speaking patients with SLE is lacking. Methods This analytical observational study evaluates the videos uploaded to YouTube (R) in Spanish about SLE. Information about video length, engagement (i.e., views and likes), time on the internet, popularity index, and source was retrieved, and an evaluation on reliability, comprehensiveness, and quality was performed using standardized scores. Results One hundred eighty-six videos were included in the analysis. Most videos were considered as useful (87%) or useful patient opinion (8.1%), whereas only 2.2% were considered misleading and 2.7% as misleading patient opinion. The number of views (Median 7207 vs 113,877, p = .012), popularity index (Median 13.8 vs 168.7, p < .001), number of likes (Median 155 vs 3400, p < .001), and number of dislikes (Median 3 vs 138, p = .004) were higher for misleading videos. The videos uploaded by independent users had a higher engagement than those from government or news agencies, professional organizations or academic channels.

In Colombia, despite having specific protocols for its notification, diagnosis, and management, there are still limitations in its control. Objectives: To describe the sociodemographic and clinical characteristics, as well as the spatial distribution of gestational syphilis in Cali, Colombia, in 2018. Materials and methods: We conducted a cross-sectional study of 427 gestational syphilis cases reported to the Colombian national epidemiological surveillance system (Sivigila). For the statistical processing, we used the R program, version 3.5.3. We expressed qualitative variables as proportions and quantitative ones through central tendency and dispersion measures, and to establish the spatial distribution we used the Qgis program, version 3.0. Results: The prevalence of gestational syphilis was 17 cases per 1,000 live births (including stillbirths); 57.1% of patients belonged to the subsidized healthcare system and 16.6% had no health insurance; 90.4% of cases were diagnosed during pregnancy; 47.2% of the pregnant women received three doses of penicillin, yet only 57.6% of contacts were treated. Conclusions: The prevalence of gestational syphilis in Cali during 2018 exceeded the national rate with a higher frequency among women in socioeconomic vulnerability conditions consistent with the general spatial distribution.

We explore the tensions that emerge between individual motives and sustainability spheres when making food consumption choices in a university community in Bogota, Colombia. This complex phenomenon is addressed through a qualitative methodology based on observations, visual diaries, and a game-based protocol, which allow us to delve into food consumption motives while trying to avoid social desirability bias. Our results show a plate that is high in cereals, roots, tubers, plantains, and animal-based protein, and low in vegetables, fruits, and plant-based proteins. Behind this plate, most tensions emerge between family traditions and other sustainability spheres. These tensions are related to socio-affective risks, animal suffering, time constraints, effort, and monetary costs. Integrating sociocultural elements such as family traditions in public policy becomes fundamental when promoting sustainable diets in similar contexts.

A scoping review,"BACKGROUND: Case management interventions have shown to be effective to prevent musculoskeletal pain and disability, but a single definition has not been achieved, nor an agreed profile for case managers. OBJECTIVE: To describe the elements that define case management and case managers tasks for return-to-work of workers with musculoskeletal disorders (MSDs). METHODS: A comprehensive computerized search of articles published in English until February 16, 2021 was carried out in several bibliographic databases. Grey literature was obtained through a search of 13 key websites. A peer-review screening of titles and abstracts was carried out. Full text in-depth analysis of the selected articles was performed for data extraction and synthesis of results. RESULTS: We identified 2,422 documents. After full-text screening 31 documents were included for analysis. These were mostly European and North American and had an experimental design. Fifteen documents were published between 2010 to 2021 and of these 7 studies were published from 2015. Fifteen elements were identified being the commonest ""return-towork programme"" (44.4%) and ""multidisciplinary assessment/interdisciplinary intervention"" (44.4%). Of 18 tasks found, the most frequent was ""establishing goals and planning return-to-work rehabilitation"" (57.7%). Eighteen referral services were identified.

Here, we demonstrate that fundamentally different processes can occur in the two types of organic semiconductors instead. Using complementary experimental techniques supported by theory, we contrast a polythiophene, where molecular p-doping leads to integer charge transfer reportedly localized to one quaterthiophene backbone segment, to the quaterthiophene oligomer itself. Despite a comparable relative increase in conductivity, we observe only partial charge transfer for the latter. In contrast to the parent polymer, pronounced intermolecular frontier-orbital hybridization of oligomer and dopant in 1:1 mixed-stack co-crystallites leads to the emergence of empty electronic states within the energy gap of the surrounding quaterthiophene matrix. It is their Fermi-Dirac occupation that yields mobile charge carriers and, therefore, the co-crystallites-rather than individual acceptor molecules-should be regarded as the dopants in such systems.",Article,"Mendez, H.; Heimel, G.; Winkler, S.; Frisch, J.; Opitz, A.; Sauer, K.; Wegner, B.; Oehzelt, M.; Rothel, C.; Duhm, S.; Tobbens, D.; Koch, N.; Salzmann, I.",,ORGANIC SEMICONDUCTORS;CONDUCTING POLYMERS;CONJUGATED POLYMERS;SOLAR-CELLS;THIN-FILMS;TRANSPORT;MODEL;SOLITONS;TETRAFLUOROTETRACYANOQUINODIMETHANE;POLY(3-HEXYLTHIOPHENE),Germany;Colombia;Austria;China,2-s2.0-84943302909;2-s2.0-84943302909

Litter decomposition recycles nutrients and causes large fluxes of carbon dioxide into the atmosphere. It is typically assumed that climate, litter quality and decomposer communities determine litter decay rates, yet few comparative studies have examined their relative contributions in tropical forests. 2. We used a short-term litterbag experiment to quantify the effects of litter quality, placement and mesofaunal exclusion on decomposition in 23 tropical forests in 14 countries. Annual precipitation varied among sites (760-5797 mm). At each site, two standard substrates (Raphia farinifera and Laurus nobilis) were decomposed in fine- and coarse-mesh litterbags both above and below ground for approximately 1 year. 3. Decomposition was rapid, with >95% mass loss within a year at most sites. Litter quality, placement and mesofaunal exclusion all independently affected decomposition, but the magnitude depended upon site. Both the average decomposition rate at each site and the ratio of above- to below-ground decay increased linearly with annual precipitation, explaining 60-65% of among-site variation. Excluding mesofauna had the largest impact on decomposition, reducing decomposition rates by half on average, but the magnitude of decrease was largely independent of climate. This suggests that the decomposer community might play an important role in explaining patterns of decomposition among sites. Which litter type decomposed fastest varied by site, but was not related to climate. 4. Synthesis. A key goal of ecology is to identify general patterns across ecological communities, as well as relevant site-specific details to understand local dynamics. Our pan-tropical study shows that certain aspects of decomposition, including average decomposition rates and the ratio of above- to below-ground decomposition are highly correlated with a simple climatic index: mean annual precipitation. However, we found no relationship between precipitation and effects of mesofaunal exclusion or litter type, suggesting that site-specific details may also be required to understand how these factors affect decomposition at local scales.",Article,"Powers, J.S.; Montgomery, R.A.; Adair, E.C.; Brearley, F.Q.; DeWalt, S.J.; Castanho, C.T.; Chave, J.; Deinert, E.; Ganzhorn, J.U.; Gilbert, M.E.; Gonzalez-Iturbe, J.A.; Bunyavejchewin, S.; Grau, H.R.; Harms, K.E.; Hiremath, A.; Iriarte-Vivar, S.; Manzane, E.; de Oliveira, A.A.; Poorter, L.; Ramanamanjato, J.B.; Salk, C.; Varela, A.; Weiblen, G.D.; Lerdau, M.T.",above ground; below ground; climate decomposition index; decomposition; decomposer fauna; litter type; precipitation; tropical forests,above ground;below ground;climate decomposition index;decomposition;decomposer fauna;litter type;precipitation;tropical forests;LEAF DECOMPOSITION;TERRESTRIAL ECOSYSTEMS;ROOT DECOMPOSITION;PLANT LITTER;SOIL;CLIMATE;MODEL;RATES;PATTERNS;CARBON,United States;United Kingdom;Brazil;France;Costa Rica;Germany;Mexico;Thailand;Argentina;Panama;India;Netherlands;Bolivia;Madagascar;Colombia,2-s2.0-67449128767;2-s2.0-67449128767

Lack of rigorous scrutiny can lead to undesirable outcomes in ecosystem management, environmental law, and policy. Contrary to the contentions of its proponents, no explicit, irreversible ecological thresholds allow distinctions between 'novel ecosystems' and 'hybrid' or 'historic' ones.

The rapid urbanization and motorization in megacities have a direct impact on sustainable development. Hence, it is very frequently to find the multiple actors from both private and public sectors involved in the design and operation of urban passenger transportation systems to make decisions that seek at optimizing their own particular objectives. However, urban passenger transport system is a very complex task involving multiple criteria related to economic, environmental and socio-political issues. Multi-criteria decision-making (MCDM) techniques actually aid the decision making process by assessing such problems. This paper presents a review of research papers published between 1982 and 2014 (up to May) concerning MCDM for the design and operation of urban passenger transport systems. From the analysis over more than 30 years, the current paper highlights the importance of taking into account the multiplicity of actors and their own decision criteria, as well as the resolution technique.

Aging affects flexible pavement performance and is produced by intrinsic and extrinsic variables as well as exposure time. Intrinsic variables include asphalt and aggregate properties, a mixture's asphalt content, binder film thickness and air void content; extrinsic variables are associated with production (short-term aging) and exposure to environmental field conditions (long-term aging). Taken together, both variables demonstrate that aging results from three distinct mechanisms: volatilisation, oxidation and steric hardening. Temperature, pressure and photo degradation treatments are used to simulate aging in the laboratory and empirical and semi-empirical models are created to represent and study aging. Aging increases asphalt complex modulus and decreases the phase angle. Mixtures become stiffer while fatigue life becomes reduced. Carbonyl and sulfoxide group formation in asphalt are often studied as such chemical changes show oxidation in aged asphalts. The prevailing models used to predict asphalt aging are discussed, though more comprehensive research into asphalt aging is still needed.",Review,"Fernandez-Gomez, W.D.; Quintana, H.R.; Lizcano, F.R.",Asphalt aging; asphalt mixture aging; oxidation; volatilization; steric hardening; aging models; aging testing,Asphalt aging;asphalt mixture aging;oxidation;volatilization;steric hardening;aging models;aging testing;PETROLEUM ASPHALTS;OXYGEN ABSORPTION;PERFORMANCE;CONSTITUENTS;BITUMEN;BEHAVIOR;STATE;MODEL,Colombia,2-s2.0-84875980204

There is potential to improve health care quality if nurses routinely use the best available evidence in their clinical practice. Since many of the factors perceived by nurses as barriers to the implementation of evidence-based practice (EBP) lie at the organisational level, it is of interest to devise and assess the effectiveness of organisational infrastructures designed to promote EBP among nurses. Objectives To assess the effectiveness of organisational infrastructures in promoting evidence-based nursing. Search methods We searched the Cochrane Effective Practice and Organisation of Care (EPOC) Group Specialised Register, the Cochrane Central Register of Controlled Trials (CENTRAL), MEDLINE, EMBASE, CINAHL, LILACS, BIREME, IBECS, NHS Economic Evaluations Database, Social Science Citation Index, Science Citation Index and Conference Proceedings Citation Indexes up to 9 March 2011. We developed a new search strategy for this update as the strategy published in 2003 omitted key terms. Additional search methods included: screening reference lists of relevant studies, contacting authors of relevant papers regarding any further published or unpublished work, and searching websites of selected research groups and organisations. Selection criteria We considered randomised controlled trials, controlled clinical trials, interrupted times series (ITSs) and controlled before and after studies of an entire or identified component of an organisational infrastructure intervention aimed at promoting EBP in nursing. The participants were all healthcare organisations comprising nurses, midwives and health visitors. Data collection and analysis Two authors independently extracted data and assessed risk of bias. For the ITS analysis, we reported the change in the slopes of the regression lines, and the change in the level effect of the outcome at 3, 6, 12 and 24 months follow-up. Main results We included one study from the USA (re-analysed as an ITS) involving one hospital and an unknown number of nurses and patients. The study evaluated the effects of a standardised evidence-based nursing procedure on nursing care for patients at risk of developing healthcare-acquired pressure ulcers (HAPUs). If a patient's admission Braden score was below or equal to 18 (i.e. indicating a high risk of developing pressure ulcers), nurses were authorised to initiate a pressure ulcer prevention bundle (i.e. a set of evidence-based clinical interventions) without waiting for a physician order. Re-analysis of data as a time series showed that against a background trend of decreasing HAPU rates, if that trend was assumed to be real, there was no evidence of an intervention effect at three months (mean rate per quarter 0.7%; 95% confidence interval (CI) 1.7 to 3.3; P = 0.457). Given the small percentages post intervention it was not statistically possible to extrapolate effects beyond three months. Authors' conclusions Despite extensive searching of published and unpublished research we identified only one low-quality study; we excluded many studies due to non-eligible study design. If policy-makers and healthcare organisations wish to promote evidence-based nursing successfully at an organisational level, they must ensure the funding and conduct of well-designed studies to generate evidence to guide policy.",Review,"Flodgren, G.; Rojas-Reyes, M.X.; Cole, N.; Foxcroft, D.R.","Evidence-Based Medicine; Efficiency, Organizational; Nursing Care [standards]; Nursing Research [standards]; Outcome and Process Assessment (Health Care) [standards]; Randomized Controlled Trials as Topic","Evidence-Based Medicine;Efficiency, Organizational;Nursing Care [standards];Nursing Research [standards];Outcome and Process Assessment (Health Care) [standards];Randomized Controlled Trials as Topic;PATIENT OUTCOMES;HEALTH-CARE;QUALITY;MODEL;BARRIERS",United Kingdom;Colombia,

Recently, quantitative tools based on multi-criteria decision-making methods (MCDM) have received more attention; however, studies still have limitations. Such is the case of Fuzzy DEMATEL, which has been proposed in the literature, but not integrated within the whole process of strategy formulation. In addition, studies have presented weaknesses by not considering, for instance, the logical structure of a strategy map. Hence, the main objective of this study is to propose the development of a method that supports the overall process of planning, structuring and validating a business unit strategy while overcoming the limitations of previous works, considering the subjectivity of decision-making in the construction of strategy maps. To fulfil these purposes, this study proposes an extension of the work of Lopez-Ospina et al. (2017) entitled ""A method for designing strategy maps using DEMATEL and linear programming"", by integrating fuzzy logic and traditional, conceptual and qualitative tools to support the diagnosis and strategy design. The significant contributions of this work is that it overcomes limitations of previous methods by providing: (1) a logic structure of strategy maps; (2) integration of subjectivity within the overall formulation process of the strategy; (3) selection of the most important relationships between strategy objectives to explain efficiently, functionally, and easily the route map of a strategy; and (4) integration of traditional qualitative tools with quantitative tools, making the process robust and holistic. The proposed method was applied to an Official Banking business unit of a Colombian bank, where expert judgment for strategy formulation helps to test the effect of the methodological design.

However, many tumors show a high resistance to these interventions, and recurrences are frequent since conventional therapies do not take into account the unique molecular features of different subtypes of glioma. Molecular genetics provide new insights in classifying gliomas and predicting response to therapy that can range from conventional treatments to new revolutionary therapeutic approaches.

It is connected with significant increase in human life span in these regions and with the absence of efficient medicines for treatment and prevention of such diseases. Lack of positive results in the developing of novel drugs for AD treatment stimulates special attention on problem of early diagnosis and drug discovery for pharmacotherapy on the very early stages of dementia, in particular, on mild cognitive impairments (MCI) due to AD. Here we review the state of art in the field of MCI diagnostics and analyze the data on the pharmacological agents developed for MCI treatment, which currently are in preclinical and clinical trials. The conclusion was made that only the agents that act on the very early pathogenetic stages of the disease, when the damage of cholinergic neurons is not observed, can be efficient for pharmacotherapeutic intervention of MCI. Therefore, the focused search and design of ""disease-modifying"" medicines should be accepted as the most (and may be the only) efficient strategy for treatment and prevention of MCI.

A synergic effect between pressure and temperature was observed in HPH and HPP treatments achieving 2.38 log cycles after 120 MPa at 30 A degrees C for 10 s (final T of 45 A degrees C) and 6.12 log cycles after 400 MPa at 45 A degrees C for 1 min (final T of 60 A degrees C), respectively. A combined treatment of 100 MPa at 15 A degrees C for 10 s and 300 MPa at 15-30 A degrees C for 1 min in HPH and HPP, respectively, was needed to the first logarithm microbial population decline. Weibull model accurately predicted microorganism inactivation kinetics after HPH and HPP processing when displaying single shoulder or tail in the survivor curves, whereas when a more complex trend was observed after thermal treatment, the double-Weibull equation was found more appropriate to explain such behaviour. Equivalent treatments that achieved the same degree of microbial inactivation (77 A degrees C-10 s in thermal processing, 120 MPa-10 s at 30 A degrees C in HPH processing and 375 MPa-1 min at 30 A degrees C in HPP) were selected to study the effects on quality parameters.

The large size and diversity of the assemblage, as well as its good preservation, qualify HWK EE as a reference site for the study of the late Oldowan at Olduvai Gorge and elsewhere in Africa. In addition, the description of the stratigraphic and archaeological sequence of HWK EE presented in this paper constitutes the foundation for further studies on hominin behavior and paleoecology in Lower and Middle Bed II.

,,,27,WOS:000409340400013,2017,A method for designing strategy maps using DEMATEL and linear programming,"Purpose - The purpose of this paper is to propose a quantitative methodology for the identification of the causal relationships between strategic objectives in a strategy map of a balanced scorecard. This is done to face the possible weaknesses described in the literature regarding the causal links and the difficulty in validating the relationships. Design/methodology/approach - The proposed method combines the multi-criteria decision-making method called decision-making trial and evaluation laboratory (DEMATEL) and an optimization model. DEMATEL is used to establish the importance of the strategic relations between strategic objectives, and the optimization model is used to find the relations that are more ""important"" and should be included in the strategy map. The method was created by reviewing the existing literature, modeling the problem, and applying it in a company. Findings - The most important results of applying this methodological design include that the proposed method maintains the BSC classical structure; it also enables the generation of several alternatives to support the decision-making process in terms of strategic objectives for a better organizational performance. Practical implications - The method facilitates the decision-making process by presenting several alternatives of strategy maps according to different levels of organizational criteria. In fact, these alternatives help the organization in focusing on the most important aspects of the strategy map. Consequently, managers may identify where to pay more attention and resources in order to achieve the most important objectives of the company. Hence, this method, as a support for decision makers, enables (and requires) the active participation of senior managers and any kind of decision makers in creating and valuating objectives, relations, constraints, importance, and parameters of the optimization model. Originality/value - DEMATEL has been used to design strategy maps. The contribution of the paper is the use of a linear programming model to select those relationships that should be included in the strategy map. It allows manager to focus on those strategic elements that are important from a strategic point of view. The application in a company showed that the contribution is not only theoretical but practical as well.",Article,"Lopez-Ospina, H.; Quezada, L.E.; Barros-Castro, R.A.; Gonzalez, M.A.; Palominos, P.I.",Optimization; Linear programming; DEMATEL; Performance indicators; Balanced scorecard; Strategy maps,Optimization;Linear programming;DEMATEL;Performance indicators;Balanced scorecard;Strategy maps;BALANCED SCORECARD APPROACH;NETWORK PROCESS ANP;PERFORMANCE-MEASUREMENT;FUZZY DEMATEL;MCDM APPROACH;MODEL;INDICATORS;EVOLUTION;SUPPORT;SYSTEMS,Colombia;Chile,2-s2.0-85028990273;2-s2.0-85028990273

Even though supervisors regulate what is afforded to residents, the former find it difficult to strike the proper balance between residents' independence and support, which could create tensions. But what tensions do residents experience during clinical supervision and how do they cope with them to maximise their learning opportunities? Understanding how residents act on different affordances in the workplace is of paramount importance, as it influences their learning. METHOD Residents from different levels of training and disciplines participated in three focus groups (n = 19) and 10 semi-structured interviews (n = 10). The authors recruited these trainees using purposive and convenience sampling. Audio-recordings were transcribed verbatim and the ensuing scripts were analysed using a constructivist grounded theory methodology. RESULTS Residents reported that the autonomy and practice opportunities given by their supervisors were either excessive or too limited, and both were perceived as tensions. When in excess, trainees enlisted the help of their supervisor or peers, depending on how safe they recognised the learning environment to be. When practice opportunities were curtailed, trainees tried to negotiate more if they felt the learning environment was safe. When they did not, trainees became passive observers. Learning from each engagement was subject to the extent of intersubjectivity achieved between the actors involved. CONCLUSIONS Tensions arose when supervisors did not give trainees the desired degree of autonomy and opportunities to participate. Trainees responded in various ways to maximise their learning opportunities. For these different engagement-related responses to enhance workplace learning in specialty training, achieving intersubjectivity between trainee and supervisor seems foundational.",Article,"Olmos-Vega, F.M.; Dolmans, D.H.J.M.; Vargas-Castro, N.; Stalmeijer, R.E.",,PROCEDURAL VARIATION;SURGICAL EDUCATION;CARE;SUPERVISION;EXPERIENCE;LEARN;MODEL;POWER,Colombia;Netherlands,2-s2.0-85018267756

A phenomenological dynamic model of the oil extraction process is adopted from literature and a multi-objective optimal control problem is formulated, in order to minimize energy consumption and at the same time maximize the yield of extraction. The resulting optimal control problem is highly non-linear and it is solved by numerical methods. Simulation results are presented for three scenarios: (i) Maximum yield, (ii) minimum energy consumption and (iii) trade-off between yield and energy. It is shown that the optimal steam flow rate trajectory is not necessarily constant. Using a mixed cost-function, it is possible to extract almost 100% of oil essential while saving 60% of energy. Finally, a sensitivity analysis shows that the optimal steam trajectory has few variations when parameters of the plant physiology change. (C) 2018 Elsevier Ltd.

To this end, the concept of Consumer-based Brand-Retailer-Channel Equity (CBBRCE) is developed. The concept and its measurement are subsequently tested empirically using survey data and structural equation modelling with path-PLS. The results confirm that CBBRCE is created by CBBRC Awareness, Quality and Loyalty. The paper concludes with a discussion of the managerial implications of CBBRCE, and signals areas for further academic research. (C) 2015 Elsevier Ltd.

Methods and Findings: WHO World Mental Health (WMH) Surveys carried out in 22 countries worldwide (n = 51,344 respondents, 72.0% response rate). We assessed nine common mental conditions with the WHO Composite International Diagnostic Interview (CIDI), and ten chronic physical with a checklist. A visual analog scale (VAS) score (0, worst to 100, best) measured perceived health in the previous 30 days. Disability was assessed using a modified WHO Disability Assessment Schedule (WHODAS), including: cognition, mobility, self-care, getting along, role functioning (life activities), family burden, stigma, and discrimination. Path analysis was used to estimate total effects of conditions on perceived health VAS and their separate direct and indirect (through the WHODAS dimensions) effects. Twelve-month prevalence was 14.4% for any mental and 51.4% for any physical condition. 31.7% of respondents reported difficulties in role functioning, 11.4% in mobility, 8.3% in stigma, 8.1% in family burden and 6.9% in cognition. Other difficulties were much less common. Mean VAS score was 81.0 (SD = 0.1). Decrements in VAS scores were highest for neurological conditions (9.8), depression (8.2) and bipolar disorder (8.1). Across conditions, 36.8% (IQR: 31.2-51.5%) of the total decrement in perceived health associated with the condition were mediated by WHODAS disabilities (significant for 17 of 19 conditions). Role functioning was the dominant mediator for both mental and physical conditions. Stigma and family burden were also important mediators for mental conditions, and mobility for physical conditions. Conclusions: More than a third of the decrement in perceived health associated with common conditions is mediated by disability. Although the decrement is similar for physical and mental conditions, the pattern of mediation is different.

In situations where agricultural expansion is inevitable, it is important to manage intact landscape transformation so that impacts on environmental values are minimised. Here, we present a novel, spatially explicit, land use planning framework that addresses the decision making needed to account for different, competing economic-environment objectives (agricultural production value, biodiversity conservation, ecosystem service retention) when land use change is inevitable within an intact landscape. We apply our framework to the globally significant savannahs of the Orinoquia (Colombia), which in a post-conflict era is under increased agricultural development pressure. We show that while negative environmental impacts can be reduced through planning, the total area of land converted to agriculture is the unavoidable principal driver of biodiversity and ecosystem service loss. We therefore identify planning solutions that perform well across all objectives simultaneously, despite trade-offs among them. When 15%, 20%, 30% and 40% of the study area is allowed to be converted to agriculture, on average planning can improve species persistence and ecosystem service retention by up to 16%, 15%, 12%, and 9%, respectively, when compared to agricultural-focused solutions. Development in the region so far has had an unnecessarily large impact on environmental objectives due to a lack of effective land use planning, creating an 'opportunity debt'. Our study provides an evidence base to inform proactive planning and the development of environmentally sensible agricultural development policy and practice in the region. This framework can be used by stakeholders to achieve agriculture expansion goals and maximise economic profit while minimising impacts on the environment in the Orinoquia, or any relatively intact region that is being developed.",Article,"Williams, B.A.; Grantham, H.S.; Watson, J.E.M.; Alvarez, S.J.; Simmonds, J.S.; Rogeliz, C.A.; Da Silva, M.; Forero-Medina, G.; Etter, A.; Nogales, J.; Walschburger, T.; Hyman, G.; Beyer, H.L.",land use planning; trade-offs; multiple objectives; conservation; ecosystem services; biodiversity; agricultural development,land use planning;trade-offs;multiple objectives;conservation;ecosystem services;biodiversity;agricultural development;LAND-USE;IMPACTS;COLOMBIA;MANAGEMENT;GAINS;MODEL,Australia;United States;Colombia,2-s2.0-85080095126;2-s2.0-85080095126;2-s2.0-85080095126

In a novel set of mobile bed laboratory experiments with variable discharge, we demonstrate that vegetation colonization affects bank erosion rates, channel shape, channel sinuosity, and bar pattern. Our analyses compared the morphological evolution of channels with initially steady bars considering the following three scenarios: (1) channel without vegetation, (2) channel with vegetation added to the floodplains, and (3) channel with vegetation added to both the floodplains and the bar surfaces that emerge at low flows. Absence of vegetation produced the widest and shallowest channel with the lowest sinuosity. Floodplain vegetation in the second scenario reduced bank erosion and resulted in a deeper and more sinuous channel with shorter bars. In the third scenario, vegetation establishment on emerging bar surfaces intensified erosion on the opposing bank, enlarging the amplitude of bends. Enhanced sedimentation on vegetated bar areas increased both bar elevation and bar length compared to the second scenario. The results show that the colonization of bar surfaces by plants creates the conditions for new floodplain and island formation, fostering channel meandering and anabranching. Finally, our experiments emphasize the role of alternating high and low flows on the morphological development of streams mediated by vegetation.",Article,"Vargas-Luna, A.; Duro, G.; Crosato, A.; Uijttewaal, W.",river morphodynamics; vegetation establishment; vegetation colonization; Laboratory experiments; bank accretion; bank erosion,river morphodynamics;vegetation establishment;vegetation colonization;Laboratory experiments;bank accretion;bank erosion;RIPARIAN VEGETATION;SEDIMENT TRANSPORT;NUMERICAL-SIMULATION;FLUVIAL PROCESSES;ALTERNATE BARS;CLIMATE-CHANGE;FLOW;STREAM;PATTERNS;MODEL,Colombia;Netherlands,2-s2.0-85070285923

Up to now approaches to understand stimuli characteristics have been limited to the first stages of epiphyseal development. Furthermore, growth plate mechanical behavior has not been widely studied. In order to better understand mechanical influences on bone growth, we used Carter and Wong biomechanical approximation to analyze growth plate mechanical behavior, and explore stress patterns for different morphological stages of the growth plate. To the best of our knowledge this work is the first attempt to study stress distribution on growth plate during different possible stages of bone development, from gestation to adolescence. Stress distribution analysis on the epiphysis and growth plate was performed using axisymmetric (3D) finite element analysis in a simplified generic epiphyseal geometry using a linear elastic model as the first approximation. We took into account different growth plate locations, morphologies and widths, as well as different epiphyseal developmental stages. We found stress distribution during bone development established osteogenic index patterns that seem to influence locally epiphyseal structures growth and coincide with growth plate histological arrangement.

Canonical correlation results showed that the maximum and average rainfall intensities are the most influential variables to describe CSO water quantity and pollutant loads whereas the duration of the rainfall event and the rain depth seem to be the most influential variables to describe CSO pollutant concentrations. The analysis of partial least squares (PLS) regression models confirms the findings of the canonical correlation and highlights three main influences of rainfall on CSO characteristics: (i) CSO water quantity characteristics are mainly influenced by the maximal rainfall intensities, (ii) CSO pollutant concentrations were found to be mostly associated with duration of the rainfall and (iii) pollutant loads seemed to be principally influenced by dry weather duration before the rainfall event.

This approach corresponds to a time-of-use solution which is an indirect method, based on prices, for inducing demand modifications on consumers. An aggregator of EV fleet acts as a dealer between an electricity market and consumers. The EV aggregator is a price-taker agent from the wholesale electricity market viewpoint and price designer when selling energy to consumers. A game-theoretical model based on a Stackelberg formulation is proposed to capture the interactions between the fleet operator and electric vehicle owners, avoiding the requirement of a price elasticity model for the EV clusters. The interaction between the agents is formulated as a bi-level optimization problem: At the upper-level, the aggregator maximizes its benefits whereas the lower-level represents the dynamic behaviour of rational drivers as a fleet. The EV operator faces uncertainty in wholesale prices when buying energy and when forecasting consumption behaviour, then random parameters are modelled in a scenario framework. The model performance is evaluated through a case study using historical data from car-sharing services in Italy, comparing the result with a fixed-prices model. It is shown that the proposed price-based scheme allows to increment the aggregator profit with respect to a fixed-price contract, producing also a load shifting effect in the charging profile of the fleet.

However, little evidence on this relationship is available from developing countries, and recognition of this relationship may have important implications for substance demand reduction strategies, including efforts to prevent and treat substance use and related problems. Latin America and the Caribbean is a rich and diverse region of the world with a large range of social and cultural influences. A working group constituted by the Inter-American Drug Abuse Control Commission and the Center for Addiction and Mental Health in June, 2010 identified research on this relationship as a priority area for a multinational research partnership. Methods: This paper examines the association between self-reported child maltreatment and use in the past 12 months of alcohol and cannabis in 2294 university students in seven participating universities in six participating countries: Colombia, El Salvador, Jamaica, Nicaragua, Panama and Uruguay. The research also considers the possible impact of religiosity and minimal psychological distress as factors contributing to resiliency in these samples. Results: The results showed that experience of maltreatment was associated with increased use of alcohol and cannabis. However, the effects differed depending on the type of maltreatment experienced. Higher levels of religiosity were consistently associated with lower levels of alcohol and cannabis use, but we found no evidence of an impact of minimal psychological distress on these measures. Conclusions: This preliminary study shows that the experience of maltreatment may increase the risk of alcohol and cannabis use among university students in Latin American and Caribbean countries, but that higher levels of religiosity may reduce that risk. More work to determine the nature and significance of these relationships is needed.

In this paper, a model of location and modification of school capacity is presented as an alternative to reduce these inequalities. In Chile a student school choice is a process that depends not only on the time and income constraints but also on the decisions made by other students (segregation). This behavior is modeled using a microeconomic approach; thereby a constrained multinomial logit discrete choice model is derived. By incorporating the student's school choice in an optimization model, it becomes nonlinear. A Tabu Search metaheuristic is proposed, which unlike other implementations requires solving a fixed point system of equations to evaluate each solution. A computing experience for instances of 10 and 45 zones is developed; in the first the quality of the solution is evaluated compared to the optimum obtained by enumeration and in the second different scenarios are analyzed.

Mucopolysaccharidosis IVA (Morquio A) is caused by a deficiency of N-acetylgalactosamine-6-sulphate-sulphatase, a lysosomal enzyme required for the stepwise degradation of keratan-sulfate and chondroitin-6-sulfate. A deficiency in this enzyme results in an accumulation of glycosaminoglycans in several tissues. Currently, no effective therapies exist and only supportive measures are used to treat some manifestations of the disease. An ideal therapy is one that can be administrated early in life, has low mortality, and leads to long-term expression of the enzyme. Gene therapy emerges as a potential alternative to correct the genetic defect in MPS IVA. Objective. Adenoassociated virus-derived expression vectors (AAV) were constructed to correct in vitro the enzyme deficiency in mucopolysaccharidosis IVA. Materials and methods. Adenoasociated virus-derived vectors containing the human GALNS gene and driven by the citomegalivirus immedited-early promoter were constructed using a free-adenoviral protocol. HEK293 cells and human skin Morquio A fibroblasts were transfected with the recombinat vectors. Enzyme activity was measured in cells 24 and 48 hours post-transfection. Results. Free-adenovirus recombinant AAV vectors were obtained with titres up to 2.08x10(10) capsids/mL. HEK293 cells and Morquio A fibroblasts transfected with vectors showed GALNS activity up to 3.05 nmoles/mg/h 48 hours post-transfection. Conclusion. The AAV mediated the in vitro expression of GALNS enzyme in the transfected cells.

This is especially important in cementless components, where the final fixation is achieved by the bone itself. The aim of this study is, first, to gain insight into the bone remodelling process around a cementless glenoid component, and second, to compare the possible bone adaptation when the implant is assumed to be fully bonded (best case scenario) or completely loose (worst case scenario). 3D finite element models of a scapula with and without a cementless glenoid component were created. 3D geometry of the scapula, material properties, and several physiological loading conditions were acquired from or estimated for a specific cadaver. Update of the bone density after implantation was done according to a node-based bone remodelling scheme. Strain energy density for different loading conditions was evaluated, weighted according to their frequencies in activities of daily life and used as a mechanical stimulus for bone adaptation. The average bone density in the glenoid increased after implantation. However, local bone resorption was significant in some regions next to the bone-implant interface, regardless of the interface condition (bonded or loose). The amount of bone resorption was determined by the condition imposed to the interface, being slightly larger when the interface was loose.

However, the primary cellular and molecular events leading to altered bone remodeling remain unexplored. Thus, the aim of the current work has been to assess the molecular response that precedes the early microanatomical changes in the masseter muscle and subchondral bone of the mandibular head in adult mice after BoNTA intervention. Methods: A pre-clinical in vivo study was performed by a single intramuscular injection of 0.2 U BoNTA in the right masseter (experimental) of adult BALB/c mice. The contralateral masseter was injected with vehicle (control). Changes in mRNA levels of molecular markers of bone loss or muscle atrophy/regeneration were addressed by qPCR at day 2 or 7, respectively. mRNA levels of receptor activator of nuclear factor-kappa B ligand (RANKL) was assessed in mandibular heads, whilst mRNA levels of Atrogin-1/MAFbx, MuRF-1 and Myogenin were addressed in masseter muscles. In order to identify the early microanatomical changes at day 14, fiber diameters in transversal sections of masseter muscles were quantified, and histomorphometric analysis was used to determine the bone per tissue area and the trabecular thickness of subchondral bone of the mandibular heads. Results: An increase of up to 4-fold in RANKL mRNA levels were detected in mandibular heads of the BoNTA-injected sides as early as 2 days after intervention. Moreover, a 4-6 fold increase in Atrogin-1/MAFbx and MuRF-1 and an up to 25 fold increase in Myogenin mRNA level were detected in masseter muscles 7 days after BoNTA injections. Masseter muscle mass, as well as individual muscle fiber diameter, were significantly reduced in BoNTA-injected side after 14 days post-intervention. At the same time, in the mandibular heads from the treated side, the subchondral bone loss was evinced by a significant reduction in bone per tissue area (-40%) and trabecular thickness (-55%). Conclusions: Our results show that masseter muscle paralysis induced by BoNTA leads to significant microanatomical changes by day 14, preceded by molecular changes as early as 2 days in bone, and 7 days in muscle. Therefore, masseter muscle atrophy and subchondral bone loss detected at 14 days are preceded by molecular responses that occur during the first week after BoNTA intervention. (C) 2017 Elsevier GmbH.

The overall sample had low to medium levels of nucleotide diversity with diversity slightly higher for the Colombian population. Both populations experienced high historical gene flow and our genetic heterogeneity analyses revealed a low genetic differentiation between them. Therefore, we did not detect any molecular subspecies, or significantly different evolutionary units for T. pinchaque. This species experienced a population expansion in the last 100,000 years but this expansion was more pronounced in the Ecuadorian population especially in the last 10,000 years, whereas the Colombian population underwent a strong bottleneck in the last 5,000 years. There was no significant spatial trend in genetic structure for the mountain tapir in Colombia and Ecuador. Phylogenetic analyses did not detect any important geographic Glade within this species. Temporal split between T. pinchaque and T. terrestris might have occurred around 7-1.5 million years ago (MYA). T. pinchaque and T. terrestris +T. kabomani are two monophyletic clades, suggesting that T. kabomani is not a full species. (C) 2015 Deutsche Gesellschaft fur Saugetierkunde.

These kinds of applications are characterized by the necessity of two data-reporting modes: time-driven and event-driven. The former is used mainly for continually supervising an area and the latter for event detection and tracking. By switching between both modes, a WSN can improve its energy efficiency and event-reporting latency, compared to single data-reporting schemes. We refer to those WSNs, where both data-reporting modes are required simultaneously, as multimodal wireless sensor networks (M2WSNs). In this paper, we present, from an energy-efficiency perspective, a review of switching mechanisms for M2WSNs. Besides, we explore two sophisticated techniques required in M2WSNs for further energy saving and event-reporting latency reduction purposes: duty-cycling and wake-up radio. We highlight future directions concerning switching and network management techniques for M2WSNs.

The results from two studies indicated that the case method is as effective as the lecture method in respect of learning outcomes (i.e. declarative knowledge and situation analysis) and is related to the higher satisfaction of students (i.e. pedagogic strategies and the relation between students and the professor); however, its effects can be mediated and moderated by some personality traits of the teachers and students (conscientiousness, openness to experience, and extroversion) and by the students' motivation (social motivation). Case method is effective for promoting educational outcomes, and its usage is not just recommended for senior students but, as we have found, it is also recommended for junior students who can improve both their declarative knowledge and situation analysis skills with this method.

The model was based on ecological risk assessment principles, and incorporated a novel ranking and scoring system, based on self-organizing maps, to account for the likely ecological hazards posed by the presence of chemical substances in freshwater. This approach was used to study the chemical pollution in the Ebro River basin (Spain), whose currently applied environmental indices must be revised in terms of scientific accuracy. Ecological hazard indexes for chemical substances were calculated by pattern recognition of persistence, bioaccumulation, and toxicity properties. A fuzzy inference system was proposed to compute ecological risk points (ERP), which are a combination of the ecological hazard to aquatic sensitive organisms and environmental concentrations. By aggregating ERP, changes in water quality over time were estimated. The proposed concurrent neuro-fuzzy model was applied to a comprehensive dataset of the network controlling the levels of dangerous substances, such as metals, pesticides, and polycyclic aromatic hydrocarbons, in the Ebro river basin. The approach was verified by comparison versus biological monitoring. The results showed that water quality in the Ebro river basin is affected by presence of micro-pollutants. The ERP approach is suitable to analyze overall trends of potential threats to freshwater ecosystems by anticipating the likely impacts from multiple substances, although it does not account for synergies among pollutants. Anyhow, the model produces a convenient indicator to search for pollutant levels of concern.",Article,"Ocampo-Duque, W.; Juraske, R.; Kumar, V.; Nadal, M.; Domingo, J.; Schuhmacher, M.",Fuzzy inference systems; Self-organizing maps; Ecological risk assessment; Water quality; Ebro River (Spain),Fuzzy inference systems;Self-organizing maps;Ecological risk assessment;Water quality;Ebro River (Spain);WATER-QUALITY;IMPACT ASSESSMENT;SEDIMENT QUALITY;MODEL;NETWORK;CLASSIFICATION;POTENTIALS;POLLUTANTS;TOXICITY;CHINA,Spain;Colombia;Switzerland;United Kingdom,2-s2.0-84860537893

The DBD is modeled using an equivalent electric circuit associated with a differential equation that describes the dynamics of its conductance. This equation assumes a homogeneous behavior of the gas. This paper introduces a series of polynomial terms of the current of the gas into the conductance equation. These terms, after identification, are a very useful tool to analyze the physical mechanisms that take place in the gas. The identification process also returns the numerical values of other DBD parameters, such as associated capacitances and the breakdown voltage. In addition, an asymmetric model for the gas, which considers the direction of the current, is proposed to consider the possible geometrical dissimilarity between the two electrodes of the DBD setup.

In this changing environment, traditional forecasting methods tend to be ineffective as a consequence of the transient and highly uncertain demand of short life-cycle products (SLCP), and the scarcity of sales data. To address this challenge, we present a methodology to forecast SLCP demand using time series of similar products referred to as analogies. Linear regression and clustering techniques are used for the selection and weighting of suitable analogies. The proposed methodology is tested against seven analogue-based forecasting methods, including two implementations of non-linear regression methods.

In the bundling problem, we determine the price and the composition of bundles offered for a single segment of consumers by a firm, which is competing with others in the market, and we compare this result to a base case in which the consumers' MWTP is not considered. We assume these consumers as rational since they choose the bundle that maximise their utility and the bundle price is within their MWTP. The resulting model is a non-linear mixed integer programme which is solved in two steps: ( i) pricing is the first step; the prices are numerically determined in a fixed point equations system and ( ii) in the second step the composition of the bundle is determined by explicit enumeration. The results show that the price obtained is less than the one got in the case without CMNL ( and bigger than the costs), and the composition of the offered bundle is different as well. It is possible to conclude that not considering the consumers' MWTP in the context of the problem of bundling will imply an overestimation of the firm's profit.

Although the concept of CX is widely used, not much has been examined about how external touch points impact customer perception of experience. Therefore, the main purpose of this study is to examine the role and impact of internal and external touchpoints as dimensions of customer experience and how CX can impact consumer word-of-mouth intention. Service outcome and peace of mind were used to represent internal experience touchpoints and peer to peer quality (PTP) was used to represent an external experience touchpoint. A total of 293 usable surveys were used for analysis using a Bayesian model developed for this study instead of the more traditional SEM approaches. Results showed that an external experience touchpoint has a similar impact to those of internal experience touchpoints in the experience process. CX was also found to have a strong effect on customer word of mouth intention.

After the diagnosis of pituitary pars intermedia dysfunction, the patient was treated with three intralesional injections of APC at 10-day intervals. APC presented a mean concentration of 430 +/- 22 x 10(6) platelets and 8.6 +/- 1.3 leukocytes/mL. The treatment with APC produced growth of the hooves at a rate of 5 mm/wk and substantially reduced the foot pain (lameness) after two APC applications. The mare could be ridden 2 weeks after the third APC treatment. The treatment with oral pergolide 4 months later improved the clinical picture of the patient, albeit hirsutism remained. APC could be useful as adjunctive treatment of chronic laminitis in horses. However, additional clinical studies are necessary to determine the safety and effectiveness of APC in chronic laminitis.

Although the bovine adaptor protein 3 complex subunit delta-1 (boAP3D1) has been proposed as the potential receptor, the specific ligand-receptor interaction has not yet been completely defined and boAP3D1 receptor and gp51 3D structures have not been determined. This study was thus aimed at a functional annotation of boAP3D1 cellular adaptor protein and BLV gp51 and, proposing a reliable model for gp51-AP3D1 interaction using bioinformatics tools. The boAP3D1 receptor interaction patterns were calculated based on models of boAP3D1 receptor and gp51 complexes' 3D structures, which were constructed using homology techniques and data-driven docking strategy. The results showed that the participation of 6 key amino acids (aa) on gp51 (Asn170, Trp127, His115, Ala97, Ser98 and Glu128) and 4 aa on AP3D1 (Lys925, Asp807, Asp695 and Arg800) was highly probable in the interaction between gp51 and BLVR domains. Three gp51 recombinant peptides were expressed and purified to validate these results: the complete domain (rgp51), the N-terminal portion (rNgp51) and the C-terminal fragment (rCgp51); and binding assays to Madin-Darby bovine kidney (MDBK) cells were then carried out with each recombinant. It was found that rNgp51 preferentially bound to MDBK cells, suggesting this domain's functional role during invasion. The rNgp51-MDBK cell interaction was sensitive to trypsin (98% reduction) and chymotrypsin treatment (80% reduction).

In many cases, such devices are plastic, or varied metallic objects containing rudimentary explosives, which are not visible to the naked eye and are difficult to detect autonomously. The most effective strategy for detecting land mines also happens to be the most dangerous. This paper intends to leverage the use of a Convolutional Neural Network (CNN) to aid in the discovery of such IEDs. As part of a related project, an autonomous sensor array was used to detect the devices in terrains too hazardous for a human to survey. This paper presents a CNN and its training methodology, suitable to make use of the sensor system. This convolutional neural network can accurately distinguish between a potential IED and surrounding undergrowth and natural features of the environment in real-time.

Methods: The CORE Diabetes Model was used to simulate a hypothetical cohort of patients with T1D. Mean baseline characteristics were taken from a clinical study conducted in Colombia and a healthcare payer perspective was adopted, with a 5% annual discount rate applied to both costs and outcomes. Results: The integrated pump/CGM improved mean life expectancy by 3.51 years compared with MDI. A similar increase occurred in mean quality-adjusted life expectancy with an additional 3.81 quality-adjusted life years (QALYs). Onset of diabetes-related complications was also delayed as compared to MDI, and mean survival time free of complication increased by 1.74 years with integrated pump/CGM. Although this increased treatment costs of diabetes as compared to MDI, savings were achieved thanks to reduced expenditure on diabetes-related complications. The estimated incremental cost-effectiveness ratio (ICER) for SAP was Colombian Pesos (COP) 44,893,950 (approximately USD$23,200) per QALY gained. Conclusions: Improved blood glucose control associated to integrated pump/CGM results in a decreased incidence of diabetes-related complications and improves life expectancy as compared to MDI. Using recommended thresholds from the World Health Organization and previous coverage decisions about health technologies in Colombia, it is a cost-effective alternative to MDI for the treatment of type 1 diabetes in Colombia.

The aim of this study is to understand and describe the tourist segments with similar levels of perceived destination sustainability and trustworthiness. Perceived sustainability and perceived trustworthiness are based on tourists? perceptions of the impacts of tourism development and policies of destinations and are measured as multidimensional constructs. Based on a sample of 438 tourists from Chile and Ecuador aged over 17 years, a metaheuristic (genetic algorithm) is employed to select the most useful variables for segmentation using a machine learning process. The results reveal three tourist segments: Extremely optimistic (Segment 3), Optimistic (Segment 2) and Moderately optimistic (Segment 1).

We propose a twofold approach, by analysis and computing to deal with hysteretic, two-phase flows in porous media. First, we introduce a new analytical projection method for construction of the wave sequence in the Riemann problem for the system of equations for a prototype two-phase flow model via relaxation. Second, a new computational method is formally developed to corroborate our analysis along with a representative set of numerical experiments to improve the understanding of the fundamental relaxation modeling of hysteresis for two-phase flows. Using the projection method we show the existence by analytical construction of the solution.

We apply the criterion to the general case of axisymmetric loading and invoke the concepts of effective stresses and loss of controllability to arrive at a general criterion for the onset of liquefaction flow. The criterion is used in conjunction with an elastoplastic model for sands to generate numerical simulations. The numerical results are compared with experimental evidence to give the following insights into predicting liquefaction. (1) The onset of liquefaction flow is a state of instability occurring under both monotonic and cyclic tests, and coincides with loss of controllability. (2) The criterion proposed herein clearly and naturally differentiates between liquefaction flow (instability) and cyclic mobility. (3) Flow liquefaction not only depends on the potential of the material to generate positive excess pore pressures, but more importantly, it also depends on the current state of the material, which is rarely predicted by phenomenology.",Article,"Andrade, J.E.; Ramos, A.M.; Lizcano, A.",Elastoplasticity; Flow liquefaction; Modeling; Sands; Undrained instabilities,Elastoplasticity;Flow liquefaction;Modeling;Sands;Undrained instabilities;GRANULAR-MATERIALS;CYCLIC MOBILITY;COLLAPSE;MODEL,United States;Colombia;Canada,2-s2.0-84884589832;2-s2.0-84902585304;2-s2.0-84902585304

The inherent complexity and uncertainty of real world urge many experts to be involved in decision-making processes. This paper presents an application of the linguistic-label aggregation method in a real-life case study. The case was taken from a foresight exercise in Colombia (South America) concerning environmental and water resources planning in a river basin. The group decision-making problem is solved using a four-step approach based on (i) the evaluation of experts' opinions, (ii) the aggregation of opinions for each alternative, (iii) fuzzy ranking, and (iv) final assessment. Two main issues that are new in our work is that we consider temporal linguistic labels and a fuzzy ranking procedure that is able to include the mean, the standard deviation, the fuzzy membership function and the frequency of experts' opinions for each alternative. The approach is developed and implemented on a computational tool. Results show an efficient decision-making process, that is, the tool demonstrated to deal with shortest time frames and to increase the efficiency of the planning resources, mainly because allows the decision manager to focus on the establishment of criteria.

However, such densification strategies are shaped by evolving zoning policies which in turn are subject to tensions between private sector interests and public policy imperatives, leading to the emergence of new urban fabrics characterized by fragmentation and polarization. Bogota, Colombia, provides an exemplary case of the unpredictable outcomes of zoning policies designed to foster densification, particularly in political contexts characterized by strong private market interests operating in tension with sustainability goals favored by the public sector. Partly due to strong private sector influences and investment strategies, the city is characterized by uneven densification patterns and continuing polarization despite zoning policies intended to limit urban growth and foster densification, in particular Acuerdo 7 from 1979 and Decreto 190 from 2004.

As patients recover in the operating room, incoming surgeries are delayed. The purpose of this study was to establish the impact of this phenomenon in multiple settings. Methods: An operational mathematical study based on the queuing theory was performed. Average queue length, average queue waiting time, and daily queue waiting time were evaluated. Calculations were based on the mean patient daily flow, PACU length of stay, occupation, and current number of beds. Data was prospectively collected during a period of 2 months, and the entry and exit time was recorded for each patient taken to the PACU. Data was imputed in a computational model made with MS Excel. To account for data uncertainty, deterministic and probabilistic sensitivity analyses for all dependent variables were performed. Results: With a mean patient daily flow of 40.3 and an average PACU length of stay of 4 hours, average total lost surgical opportunity time was estimated at 2.36 hours (95% CI: 0.36-4.74 hours). Cost of opportunity was calculated at $1592 per lost hour. Sensitivity analysis showed that an increase of two beds is required to solve the queue formation. Conclusions: When congestion has a negative impact on cost of opportunity in the surgical setting, queuing analysis grants definitive actions to solve the problem, improving quality of service and resource utilization.

Common bean, Phaseolus vulgaris, is a staple crop with several wild relatives in its secondary gene pool. The year-long bean, P. dumosus, an important crop in Guatemala, is considered particularly closely related to P. vulgaris and a potential source of novel variation. However, the genetic diversity and relationship to other Phaseolus species of P. dumosus remain unclear. Methods We conducted the first comprehensive investigation of P. dumosus genetic diversity using both nuclear and chloroplast genome markers. Our nuclear marker set included over 700 markers present within the Phaseolus DArT (Diversity Arrays Technology) array, which we applied to P. dumosus and other relatives of P. vulgaris (including every secondary gene pool species: P. acutifolius, P. albescens, P. coccineus and P. costaricensis). Key Results Phaseolus dumosus arose from hybridization of P. vulgaris and P. coccineus, followed by at least two later hybridizations with sympatric congener populations.

Heart rate variability (HRV) is analyzed by measuring consecutive beat-to-beat intervals. This variability can contain information about the factors regulating cardiac activity under normal and pathological conditions, but the information obtained from such analyses is not yet fully understood. In this article, HRV in zebrafish larvae was evaluated under normal conditions and under the effect of substances that modify intrinsic cardiac activity and cardiac activity modulated by the nervous system. We found that the factors affecting intrinsic activity have negative chronotropic and arrhythmogenic effects at this stage of development, whereas neural modulatory factors have a lesser impact. The results suggest that cardiac activity largely depends on the intrinsic properties of the heart tissue in the early stages of development and, to a lesser extent, in the maturing nervous system.

Implementation of food safety management systems such as Hazard Analysis and Critical Control Points in swine abattoirs can help to mitigate pathogen exposure. The objective of the present study was to evaluate the impact of the HACCP system in slaughterhouses in Colombia on reducing Salmonella spp. exposure due to the consumption of fresh pork meat. Two slaughtering plants with a different degree of HACCP implementation were selected and a quantitative microbiological mapping was built by collecting 820 samples of Salmonella spp. enumeration at different processing stages. The overall Salmonella spp. mean concentration was 1.15 +/- 0.55 log MPN/g, with no significant differences among plants (P > 0.05). Deficiencies during carcass disinfection and temperature during distribution of meat cuts from the slaughterhouse lacking of HACCP resulted in a significant increase of Salmonella spp. prevalence (20-40%) (P < 0.05). Processing stages with the highest pathogen prevalence were transport (28-32%) and hanging (16-36%). The exposure assessment model estimated a higher degree of pathogen contamination at the time of consumption in meat cuts from the slaughterhouse without HACCP (3.36 versus 3.68 log MPN/g) and 10-fold increase in the probability a consumer would acquire a contaminated portion (0.011 versus 0.105).

Data imputation, in which the missing elements of a data matrix are replaced by plausible values, is one possible way to tackle this problem. In this paper, we consider the case of two-way data tables, e.g. phenotypic traits observed in multi-location plant trials with genotypes in the rows and environments in the columns. Two new methodologies for multiple imputation in genotype-by-environment interaction data tables, and in general two-way data tables, that combine singular value decomposition and either jackknife resampling or weighting strategies, are proposed. The proposed methods are compared with competing methods available in the literature for data imputation, by considering Monte Carlo simulations and a real data application. Two-way data tables with a given main effects and interaction structure are simulated and different percentages of observations are removed in order to obtain the three widely used missing data mechanisms: missing at random, missing completely at random, and missing not at random.

Methods We conducted a systematic search in PubMed via Medline, Scopus, Embase, and Cochrane identifying the literature up to April 2019. Out of 2258 revealed unique abstracts, we included 31 reviews, from which 25 were considered as systematic. We applied the Walsh & McPhee Systems Model of Clinical Preventive Care to systematize the determinants of screening participation. Results The reviews, mainly in high-income settings, reported a wide range for breast cancer screening participation rate: 16-90%. The determinants of breast cancer screening participation were simple low-cost interventions such as invitation letters, basic information on screening, multiple reminders, fixed appointments, prompts from healthcare professionals, and healthcare organizational factors (e.g. close proximity to screening facility). More complex interventions (such as face-to-face counselling or home visits), mass media or improved access to transport should not be encouraged by policy makers unless other information appears. The repeated participation in mammography screening was consistently high, above 62%. Previous positive experience with screening influenced the repeated participation in screening programs. The reviews were inconsistent in the use of terminology related to breast cancer screening participation, which may have contributed to the heterogeneity in the reported outcomes.

The problem known as constrained 1-ware-house, N-Retailers, with multiple item inventory systems (C-OWNRMI), additionally considers budgetary and storage capacity constraints. The former limits the amount of inventory that can be held at any moment at the DC. Similarly, capacity constraints at retailers' facilities restrict the number of items which may be delivered and stored at each retailer location. Although several authors have proposed various approaches for solving the problem in a multi-item scenario, they often consider only one item to be sold and delivered by each retailer. This study, in contrast, considers multiple items to be sold and delivered by all retailers. Further, herein, orders are placed in a coordinated manner. The main objective of this research was to identify cost-efficient solutions for the inventory system under study. With this goal, we proposed a hybrid mat-heuristic that combines the search strategy and mixed-integer programming. Furthermore, a memetic algorithm (MA) is introduced, which includes a local search operator that exploits certain mathematical properties derived from the problem.

Blood samples of loggerhead turtles that were born in the Colombian Caribbean were used. The LC50 of RBCs to methylmercury was determined at 96 h using methylmercury concentrations of 0.5-100 mg L-1. Next, the viability of the RBCs and the activity of the enzymes superoxide dismutase (SOD), glutathione S-transferase (GST), and lipid peroxidation by malondialdehyde (MDA) at 6 and 12 h of exposure to acute concentrations of 0, 1, and 5 mg L-1 were evaluated. The LC50 for loggerhead turtle RBCs was 8.32 mg L-1. The cell viability bioassay of RBCs exposed for 12 h only showed 100% cell viability. Increasing in vitro MeHg concentrations caused a corresponding increase in MDA concentration as well as decreases in the activities of SOD and GST. The RBCs represent an excellent model for ecotoxicological studies and SOD, GST, and MDA are biomarkers of environmental pollution and oxidative stress in loggerhead turtles. This was the first study conducted on loggerhead turtle where the response of RBCs to MeHg-induced oxidative stress is evaluated.",Article,"Hernandez-Fernandez, J.; Lopez-Barrera, E.A.; Marino-Ramirez, L.; Rodriguez-Becerra, P.; Pinzon-Velasco, A.",Cytotoxicity; erythrocytes; methylmercury; malondialdehyde; in vitro; superoxide dismutase,Cytotoxicity;erythrocytes;methylmercury;malondialdehyde;in vitro;superoxide dismutase;CARETTA-CARETTA;SEA-TURTLES;CHELONIA-MYDAS;MERCURY;BLOOD;THIOREDOXIN;PEROXIREDOXINS;MODEL;SYSTEM;VALUES,Colombia;United States,2-s2.0-85085594773;2-s2.0-85085594773;2-s2.0-85085594773;2-s2.0-85085594773;2-s2.0-85085594773

Fipronil is an agricultural pesticide that inhibits gamma-amino-butyric acid (GABA) gated chloride channels. In this study, zebrafish (Danio rerio) embryos were exposed for 48 h (starting at similar to 3 h post fertilization, hpf) to various concentrations of fipronil (0.02 mu g/L up to 4000 mu g/L). Following this acute exposure, a subset of fish was transferred to clean water for a 7-day depuration phase. We hypothesized that a pulse exposure to fipronil during critical periods of central nervous system development would adversely affect fish later in life. After a 48 hour pulse exposure, survival was reduced in embryos exposed to 2 mu g fipronil/L or greater. However, there was no further mortality during the depuration phase, nor were there changes in body length nor notochord length in larvae 9 dpf (days post-fertilization) compared to controls. Additional experiments were carried out at higher concentrations over 96 h (up to 4 dpf) to also elucidate developmental effects and teratogenicity of fipronil (43.7 mu g/L up to 4370 mu g/L). Fipronil at these higher concentrations significantly impacted the development of zebrafish, and the following morphometric and teratogenic effects were observed in 4 dpf fish; reduced body length, yolk sac and pericardial edema, reduced midbrain length, reduced optic and otic diameter, and truncation of the lower jaw. In depurated fish, we hypothesized that there would exist residual effects of exposure at the molecular level. Transcriptome profiling was therefore conducted on 9 dpf depurated larvae exposed initially for 48 h to one dose of either 0.2 mu g/L, 200 mu g/L or 2000 mu g/L fipronil. The expression of gene networks associated with glycogen and omega-3-fatty acid metabolism were decreased in larvae exposed to each of the three concentrations of fipronil, suggesting metabolic disruption. Moreover, transcriptomics revealed that fipronil suppressed gene networks related to light-dark adaptation, photoperiod sensing, and circadian rhythm. Based on these data, we tested fish for altered behavioral responses in a Light-Dark preference test. Larvae exposed to > 200 mu g fipronil/L as embryos showed fewer number of visits (20-30% less) to the dark zone compared to controls. Larvae also spent a lower amount of time in the dark zone compared to controls, suggesting that fipronil strengthened dark avoidance behavior which is indicative of anxiety. This study demonstrates that a short pulse exposure to fipronil can affect transcriptome networks for metabolism, circadian rhythm, and response to light in fish after depuration, and these molecular responses are hypothesized to be related to aberrant behavioral effects observed in the light-dark preference test.",Article,"Eadie, A.; Vasquez, I.C.; Liang, X.F.; Wang, X.H.; Souders, C.L.; El Chehouri, J.; Hoskote, R.; Feswick, A.; Cowie, A.M.; Loughery, J.R.; Martyniuk, C.J.",Behavior; Oxidative respiration; Pesticide; Transcriptome networks; Recovery,Behavior;Oxidative respiration;Pesticide;Transcriptome networks;Recovery;SULFONE METABOLITE;ENVIRONMENTAL FATE;GENE-EXPRESSION;TOXICITY;GABA;INSECTICIDE;DIELDRIN;MODEL,Canada;Colombia;China;United States,2-s2.0-85091215257

Initial research indicates that water collected from roofs contains high turbidity values, as well as high concentrations of total suspended solids, biochemical oxygen demand 5-Day and heavy metals. Moreover, these areas do not generally have access to public sewer systems. An eco-productive green roof with the aim of reducing poverty and improving the quality of life of the communities located peri-urban areas of Bogota has been described and examined. These eco-roofs are made with cheaply attainable materials (e.g. recycled plastic bottles). The aim of this study was to understand the hydrological benefits of this type of green roof. We built an experimental set-up consisted of six independent eco-roof modules planted with different crop plant species and a reference roof to serve as a control. The results obtained showed that the crop type had significant influence over the results of both hydrological behaviour and pollutant concentrations measured on the runoff from roofs. The eco-roof can retain up to 65% of the runoff volume and can reduce the runoff peak up to 80%; the eco-roof helped in retaining high concentrations of zinc. The results obtained represent a meaningful positive impact for the eco-roofs tested for stormwater harvesting and suggest that these systems could offer hydrological benefits that might help re-establish hydrological values for marginal urban areas.",Article,"Galarza-Molina, S.; Torres, A.; Rengifo, P.; Puentes, A.; Carcamo-Hernandez, E.; Mendez-Fajardo, S.; Devia, C.",Green roofs; Eco-roofs; Sustainable urban drainage systems; Food production; Food security,Green roofs;Eco-roofs;Sustainable urban drainage systems;Food production;Food security;RAINWATER RUNOFF;QUALITY;PERFORMANCE;POLLUTION;MODEL,Colombia,2-s2.0-85029511855

To evaluate the impact of volatile anesthetic choice on clinically relevant outcomes of patients undergoing cardiac surgery. Methods. Major databases were systematically searched for randomized controlled trials (RCTs) comparing volatile anesthetics (isoflurane versus sevoflurane) in cardiac surgery. Study-level characteristics, intraoperative events, and postoperative outcomes were extracted from the articles. Results. Sixteen RCTs involving 961 patients were included in this meta-analysis. There were no significant differences between both anesthetics in terms of intensive care unit length of stay (SMD -0.07, 95% CI -0.38 to 0.24, P = 0.66), hospital length of stay (SMD 0.06, 95% CI -0.33 to 0.45, P = 0.76), time to extubation (SMD 0.29, 95% CI -0.08 to 0.65, P = 0.12), S100 beta (at the end of surgery: SMD 0.08, 95% CI -0.33 to 0.49, P = 0.71; 24 hours after surgery: SMD 0.21, 95% CI -0.23 to 0.65, P = 0.34), or troponin (at the end of surgery: SMD-1.13, 95% CI -2.39 to 0.13, P = 0.08; 24 hours after surgery: SMD 0.74, 95% CI -0.15 to 1.62, P = 0.10).

,,,4,WOS:000833423000009,2022,Allostatic-Interoceptive Overload in Frontotemporal Dementia,"BACKGROUND: The predictive coding theory of allostatic-interoceptive load states that brain networks mediating autonomic regulation and interoceptive-exteroceptive balance regulate the internal milieu to anticipate future needs and environmental demands. These functions seem to be distinctly compromised in behavioral variant frontotemporal dementia (bvFTD), including alterations of the allostatic-interoceptive network (AIN). Here, we hypothesize that bvFTD is typified by an allostatic-interoceptive overload. METHODS: We assessed resting-state heartbeat evoked potential (rsHEP) modulation as well as its behavioral and multimodal neuroimaging correlates in patients with bvFTD relative to healthy control subjects and patients with Alzheimer's disease (N = 94). We measured 1) resting-state electroencephalography (to assess the rsHEP, prompted by visceral inputs and modulated by internal body sensing), 2) associations between rsHEP and its neural generators (source location), 3) cognitive disturbances (cognitive state, executive functions, facial emotion recognition), 4) brain atrophy, and 5) resting-state functional magnetic resonance imaging functional connectivity (AIN vs. control networks). RESULTS: Relative to healthy control subjects and patients with Alzheimer's disease, patients with bvFTD presented more negative rsHEP amplitudes with sources in critical hubs of the AIN (insula, amygdala, somatosensory cortex, hippocampus, anterior cingulate cortex). This exacerbated rsHEP modulation selectively predicted the patients' cognitive profile (including cognitive decline, executive dysfunction, and emotional impairments). In addition, increased rsHEP modulation in bvFTD was associated with decreased brain volume and connectivity of the AIN. Machine learning results confirmed AIN specificity in predicting the bvFTD group. CONCLUSIONS: Altogether, these results suggest that bvFTD may be characterized by an allostatic-interoceptive overload manifested in ongoing electrophysiological markers, brain atrophy, functional networks, and cognition.",Article,"Birba, A.; Santamaria-Garcia, H.; Prado, P.; Cruzat, J.; Ballesteros, A.S.; Legaz, A.; Fittipaldi, S.; Duran-Aniotz, C.; Slachevsky, A.; Santibanez, R.; Sigman, M.; Garcia, A.M.; Whelan, R.; Moguilner, S.; Ibanez, A.",,HEART-RATE-VARIABILITY;BEHAVIORAL VARIANT;ALZHEIMERS-DISEASE;SOCIAL COGNITION;NETWORK CONNECTIVITY;NEURAL MARKERS;BRAIN ATROPHY;MODEL;STRESS;METAANALYSIS,Chile;Argentina;Colombia;United States;Ireland;Spain,2-s2.0-85130013753

A text mining analysis, using Leximancer 4.5 software, of the most influential SE research studies was conducted to identify themes and trace changes over time. Our literature search process produced 101 articles, which were used in the analysis. The analysis was conducted over three time periods corresponding to three different phases of SE research. The nascent phase covers 1990-2002; the growth phase covers 2003-2010, and the maturity phase covers 2011-2018. This temporal analysis reveals that different themes emerged at the different phases. The dominant theme in the first phase focused on the social entrepreneur (individual level). The second phase focused heavily on the organisational level of SE and the third phase focused on institutional and contextual dimensions of social entrepreneurship. Overall, our analysis revealed four dominant themes in SE, namely (1) social entrepreneurs, individuals and communities (2) organisation of SE (3) innovation and value creation in SE, and (4) context of social entrepreneurship.

In the actual body of knowledge, several methods have been proposed to handle this problem, starting from the Project Evaluation and Review Technique to advanced simulation models. However, this investigation proposes a novel integration of one methodology with some approaches already existing in the literature related to Monte Carlo Simulation scheduling techniques as seen from the perspective of a practitioner. The research began with a literature review of both schedule risks and Monte Carlo based scheduling models for construction projects. Based on this, the methodology was designed with the constant participation of experts in the construction industry. As result of this, a comprehensive and practical methodology was constructed. Therefore, a new mathematical structure for the simulation model within the methodology was formulated in which a new concept for each risk defined as ""potential impact""was used. Moreover, the simulation model is based on the judgment of experts and methods of the known literature such as the explicit model of the occurrence probability of the risks and the activity-risk factor matrix. Then, to validate the tool, the proposed methodology was applied using the information of an already constructed construction project of a public university of Colombia. The obtained results were a confidence-based forecast of the end date of the project and a quantitative importance measure of the modelled risks. These results were compared against the real history of the project since it was found an excellent performance of the proposed methodology.

However, there is insufficient information on its population structure and dynamics, conservation status, or extinction risk and population decreases have been inferred from observations of habitat degradation. In 2002 and 2012, surveys using manta tows, circular plots and satellite images were performed in Old Providence and Santa Catalina Islands (Seaflower Biosphere Reserve) to determine changes in the condition and structure of a local population of D. cylindrus and its habitat. Size-frequency histograms were asymmetric and leptokurtic, showing positive distribution induced by colony fragmentation, which is indicative of reef degradation. Signs of degradation were more evident in 2012, when partial mortality of living tissue in the parent colony yielded 96.6% of the asexually produced fragments. Most of the fragments were from larger colonies (>= 115 cm), which exhibited the highest partial and total mortality (>50%). Three of the four benthic habitats used by the species in 2002 were seen in 2012, but with reduced areas. The results suggest that the reduction of living tissue, the dominance of colonies produced asexually, and reduced size of fragments limit population growth and species viability in an unfavorable and changing habitat within this marine protected area (MPA) of the southwestern Caribbean. In the west of the reef complex of Old Providence, a synergy of multiple stressors could cause the habitat degradation and the fragmentation of colonies, limiting the potential recovery of the species and therefore the ability to create a healthy, genetically diverse and resilient population. Thus, these stressors must be minimized to prevent local extinction. Monitoring the population trends and recording sexual recruitment continues to be vital to understand the larvae's habitat selection and determine whether these habitats are suitable for the survival of coral recruits. Other stressors to be monitored include anchor damage, diseases and bleaching.

Homogeneous dispersion, high concentration, and orientation of the embedded filler strategies have been assumed to maximize the voltage output in nanocomposite generators. This work contrast these assumptions by studying the dominance of the interphase in low filler concentrations (<10%) and random dispersions in a ZnO/PDMS nanocomposite generator with high peak-to-peak voltage generation capabilities (approximate to 150 V). The interphase in the nanocomposite was studied by the analysis of the random dispersion of the nanocomposite through the estimation of the effective volume fraction (phi(agg)) which allowed us to identify three levels of interaction: individual interphases, interacting interphases, and overlapping between NPs and interphases. The interacting interphase is responsible here for the high generated voltage. In addition, the impact of the interphase was studied by applying lumped element (LE) and interphasial powerlaw (IPL) models that capture the measured voltages and the electromechanical film properties.

Therefore, this paper aims to formulate and solve a Put-away Routing Problem (PRP) in distribution centres (DCs). This PRP formulation represents a novel approach due to the consideration of a fleet of homogeneous Material Handling Equipment (MHE), heterogeneous products linked to a put-away list size, depot location and multi-parallel aisles in a distribution centre. It should be noted that the slotting problem, rather than the PRP, has usually been studied in the literature, whereas the PRP is addressed in this paper. The PRP is solved using a discrete particle swarm optimization (PSO) algorithm that is compared to tabu search approaches (Classical Tabu Search (CTS), Tabu Search (TS) 2-Opt) and an empirical rule. As a result, it was found that a discrete PSO generates the best solutions, as the time savings range from 2 to 13% relative to CTS and TS 2-Opt for different combinations of factor levels evaluated in the experimentation.",Article,"Gomez-Montoya, R.A.; Cano, J.A.; Cortes, P.; Salazar, F.",put-away routing; distribution centre; discrete particle swarm optimization; order picking; warehouse management,put-away routing;distribution centre;discrete particle swarm optimization;order picking;warehouse management;ORDER-PICKING;WAREHOUSE;MODEL;CONGESTION;DESIGN,Colombia;Spain,2-s2.0-85097316780;2-s2.0-85097316780

In this way, we explain how this brand generates a social status in emerging markets, which allow their consumers to excel socially. On the other hand, we explain how Starbucks contributes positively to sustainability in these types of markets, generating greater well-being for both the environment and society in general. In this way, this brand manages to transmit messages with symbolic values of social status, as well as social and environmental awareness. This research allows us to see how Starbucks is able to generate conspicuous consumption in Colombia, which is the third largest exporter of coffee in the world but is also capable of generating sustainable processes that help Colombian coffee growers and the environment. This research used a quantitative methodology based on a structured questionnaire made for conspicuous consumers of the Starbucks brand in Colombia, whose data were processed through the statistical program PLS 3.2.7. This research details the sustainable processes carried out by this brand in this developing country and the reasons why its consumption in this emerging market is considered conspicuous. For this research, family allocentrism, ethnocentrism, and patriotism are considered antecedents of conspicuous consumption, and brand image and brand loyalty are considered their results.",Article,"Areiza-Padilla, J.A.; Puertas, M.A.M.",conspicuous consumption; global brands; sustainable brands; ethnocentrism; patriotism; brand image; brand loyalty; family allocentrism,conspicuous consumption;global brands;sustainable brands;ethnocentrism;patriotism;brand image;brand loyalty;family allocentrism;CONSUMER ETHNOCENTRISM;LUXURY CONSUMPTION;IMAGE;LOYALTY;IDENTITY;MATERIALISM;IMPACT;MODEL;TRUST;ALLOCENTRISM,Colombia;Spain,2-s2.0-85114349540

An equivalent circuit model of the DBD is considered. It is shown that the excilamp power can be controlled by applying current to the lamp. This highly desired property is ensured by means of a specific power supply topology, whose concepts and design are discussed. The experimental prototype of a current-mode converter operating in the pulsed regime at pulse repetition rate of 50 kHz is presented and its capability to control the amount of energy transferred during each current pulse is demonstrated. The capability of this power supply to maintain specific operating conditions for the DBD lamp, with a very stable behaviour (even at a very low current, in the regime of a single discharge channel), is illustrated. The experimental results of a combined use of this converter and a XeCl excilamp are presented. The influence of the supply parameters on the 308-nm XeCl excilamp is analysed. The shape of the UV pulse of the lamp is experimentally shown to be similar to that of the current, which actually flows into the gas mixture. The UV radiation power is demonstrated to be tightly correlated to the current injected into the gas and controlled by the available degrees of freedom offered by the power supply. The measured UV output characteristics and performance of the system are discussed. Time resolved UV imaging of a XeCl DBD excilamp is used to analyse the mechanisms involved in the production of exciplexes at various power supply regimes. It is shown that a pulsed voltage source leads to formation of short high intensity UV peaks, while current pulses lead to formation of sustained discharge filaments. Based on the results of modelling of the above-mentioned operation conditions, the two power supply regimes are compared and analysed from the point of view of the UV power and radiative control.",Article,"Piquet, H.; Bhosle, S.; Diez, R.; Cousineau, M.; Djibrillah, M.; Le Thanh, D.; Dagang, A.N.; Zissis, G.",dielectric barrier discharge; exciplex; current regime; power supply; static converter; UV,dielectric barrier discharge;exciplex;current regime;power supply;static converter;UV;EXCIMER LAMPS;MODEL;DESIGN;POWER,France;Colombia,2-s2.0-84858115679;2-s2.0-84858115679;2-s2.0-84858115679

Utilities can use this approach to incentive or discourage the charge of EVs according to different constraints. In this study, the authors refer the EV clusters or fleets, where there is only one energy buyer for all the clusters. This approach corresponds to an indirect method based on prices to induce behaviours in the management of charging on clusters of EVs. The first actor of the algorithm is an aggregator of EV fleet operators acting as a dealer between the electricity market and consumers. A theoretical game model based on Stackelberg's formulation is proposed to capture the interaction between the fleet operator and the owners/drivers of the EVs. A bi-level optimisation problem arises to represent the game between the agents involved: at the upper level, the aggregator maximises its benefits, while the lower level represents the behaviour of rational drivers as a fleet.

Rotations are carried out along the course of a six months time period during which students rotate through different services both during one or multiple fortnightly periods. The hospital receives trainees from different universities that present heterogeneous requirements, and must accomplish different rotations constraints even in those cases when they come from the same university. Two different approaches are proposed to tackle the problem. First, a mathematical programming model is considered. Secondly, a metaheuristic approach based on Variable Neighborhood Search is adapted to solve the problem in an efficient manner. In both cases the objective function is proposed to be either a linear or a quadratic function that seeks a stable allocation of personnel to the services all along the considered time horizon. The proposed techniques are implemented as a part of a basic spreadsheet that helps personnel in charge generate, validate and fix the proposed plans as needed. The effectiveness of the methodology is tested through ex-post analysis, comparing it against schedules generated by the personnel in charge at the hospital, and over simulated data. The results indicate that the applied metaheuristic is competitive against specialized optimization software and facilitates the work of optimization for the health professionals in charge, reducing the planning tasks from several days to minutes.

Therefore, a combination of principal component analysis (PCA) to reduce the dimensionality of a data set and artificial neural networks (ANNs) for forecasting purposes was used. The results obtained were compared with those obtained by using discrete Fourier transform (DFT). The proposed methodology was applied to four absorbance time series data sets composed by a total number of 5705 UV-Vis spectra. Absolute percentage errors obtained by applying the proposed PCA/ANN methodology vary between 10% and 13% for all four study sites. In general terms, the results obtained were hardly generalizable, as they appeared to be highly dependent on specific dynamics of the water system; however, some trends can be outlined. PCA/ANN methodology gives better results than PCA/DFT forecasting procedure by using a specific spectra range for the following conditions: (i) for Salitre wastewater treatment plant (WWTP) (first hour) and Graz West R05 (first 18 min), from the last part of UV range to all visible range; (ii) for Gibraltar pumping station (first 6 min) for all UV-Vis absorbance spectra; and (iii) for San Fernando WWTP (first 24 min) for all of UV range to middle part of visible range.",Article,"Plazas-Nossa, L.; Hofer, T.; Gruber, G.; Torres, A.",artificial neural networks; discrete Fourier transform; principal component analysis; time series forecasting; UV-Vis; water quality,artificial neural networks;discrete Fourier transform;principal component analysis;time series forecasting;UV-Vis;water quality;WATER;SYSTEMS;LIMITATIONS;MODEL,Colombia;Austria,2-s2.0-85017264741

The roles of perilesional and ipsilesional tissue in recovery from poststroke aphasia are unclear. We investigated the impact of reading training (using iReadMore, a therapy app) on the connections within and between the right and left the misphere\of the reading network of patients with CA. In patients with pure alexia, iReadMore increased feedback from left inferior frontal gyrus (IFG) region to the left occipital (OCC) region. We aimed to identify whether iReadMore therapy was effective through a similar mechanism in patients with CA. Participants with chronic poststroke CA(n = 23) completed 35 h of iReadMore training over 4 weeks. Reading accuracy for trained and untrained words was assessed before and after therapy. The neural response to reading trained and untrained words in the left and right OCC, ventral occipitotemporal, and IFG regions was examined using event-related magnetoencephalography. The training-related modulation in effective connectivity between regions was modeled at the group level with dynamic causal modeling. iReadMore training improved participants' reading accuracy by an average of 8.4% (range, -2.77 to 31.66) while accuracy for untrained words was stable. Training increased regional sensitivity in bilateral frontal and occipital regions, and strengthened feedforward connections within the left hemisphere.

More recent work posits that the effects are mediated by institutions. We take this newer approach further by arguing that economic and political institutions not just mediate but actually shape resource dependence. Our focus is on performance across national oil companies (NOCs) in Latin America. We explain performance variation by invoking variations in regime and market features. NOCs that operate in contexts of greater independence from the Executive Branch (stronger checks and balances within and outside the sector) and greater market forces-though not necessarily private actor dominance-exhibit better performance. Institutions thus influence sector conditions, rather than the other way around. We advance this argument using original data from Colombia and Venezuela, and supplementary data from Mexico, Brazil, and Argentina.

Deterministic version of the problem has been widely studied. However, this assumption can lead to inaccurate and ineffective decisions. In this research, we tackle the stochastic version of two-echelon inventory system by designing an extension of a well-known heuristic. This research considers customer demands as following a normal density function. A set of 240 random instances was generated and used in evaluating both the deterministic and stochastic solution approaches. Due to the nature of the objective function, evaluation was carried out via Monte Carlo simulation. For variable demand settings, computational experiments shows that: i) the use of average demand to define the inventory policy implies an underestimation of the total cost and ii) the newly proposed method offers cost savings.

,,,1,WOS:000538430200008,2020,An online real-time matheuristic algorithm for dispatch and relocation of ambulances,"The Medical System of Transportation deals with two online real-time decisions: ambulance dispatching and relocation. Dispatching consists of selecting which ambulance to send to an emergency call; relocation consists of determining how to modify the location of available ambulances in response to changes in the system's state. Although the literature regarding this problem is extensive, only a limited number of online real-time approaches for ambulance management have been proposed, much less one taking into consideration different types of emergencies and vehicles. This paper proposes an online real-time matheuristic algorithm that combines: i) a new preparedness index defined as the availability probability of a multi-server queue model which is used as an optimization objective and as a control variable for relocation strategies, ii) two mathematical models to solve the relocation problem, one oriented to the maximization of coverage and other to the minimization of the maximum relocation time, and iii) two heuristic algorithms oriented to the maximization of the preparedness level, one to solve the dispatch problem and other to solve the location problem of one ambulance. The computational experiments, based on discrete event simulation and historical data of Bogota, Colombia, have shown their capability to adequately respond to the necessities of real-time operation.

,,,1,WOS:000782725600004,2022,A revisited fuzzy DEMATEL and optimization method for strategy map design under the BSC framework: selection of objectives and relationships,"This paper proposes a quantitative method for the selection of strategic objectives and causal relationships to be included in a strategy map of a Balanced Scorecard. A strategy map usually contains the strategic objectives of an organization, grouped into four perspectives: (a) finances, (b) clients, (c) internal processes, and (d) growth and learning, all of them linked through cause-effect relationships. The use of quantitative tools, such as multicriteria decision making, has been proposed to model a strategy map and to select the causal relationships to be included. However, no work has been found in the literature to select the strategic objectives to be incorporated into the map. This is the gap that is addressed in this paper. To overcome this gap, the proposed method incorporates a fuzzy multicriteria method known as DEMATEL (decision-making trial and evaluation laboratory) with an optimization model to choose the strategic objectives and their causal relationships. DEMATEL is used to set priorities to the components of the strategy map, whereas the optimization model selects those to be included by producing the appropriate balance between conflicting goals that appear in building a strategy map (minimum amount of relationships among strategic objectives, maximizing the weight of the relationships/objectives selected). As an illustrative case, the method is applied to a higher education institution where expert judgment in this field provided validation of the strategy map designed.",Article,"Lopez-Ospina, H.; Pardo, D.; Rojas, A.; Barros-Castro, R.; Palacio, K.; Quezada, L.",Balanced Scorecard; Fuzzy DEMATEL; Strategy maps; Optimization method,Balanced Scorecard;Fuzzy DEMATEL;Strategy maps;Optimization method;PERFORMANCE EVALUATION;MANAGEMENT;PROPOSAL;MODEL,Colombia;Chile,2-s2.0-85128243714;2-s2.0-85128243714

The spatial discretization of these equations was developed via the spectral multidomain penalty method (SMPM). The temporal terms were discretized using a strong-stability preserving Runge-Kutta method. Stability of the numerical scheme is ensured with the use of a spectral filter and a constant or regularized lateral earth pressure coefficient. The test case is a granular avalanche that is generated in a small-scale rectangular flume with a topographical gradient. A grid independence test was performed to clarify the order of the error in the mass conservation produced by the treatments here implemented. The numerical predictions of the granular avalanches are compared with experimental measurements performed by Denlinger and Iverson (2001). Furthermore, the boundary conditions and parameters such as lateral earth pressure coefficients and the momentum correction factor were analyzed in order to observe the incidence of these features when solving the granular flow equations. This work identifies the benefits and weaknesses of the SMPM to solve this set of equations, and thus, it is possible to conclude that the SMPM provides an appropriate solution to the granular flow equations proposed by Iverson and Denlinger (2001) and comparable predictions for the experimental data.",Article,"Trujillo-Vela, M.G.; Escobar-Vargas, J.A.; Ramos-Canon, A.M.",Granular avalanches; Numerical simulation; Spectral multidomain penalty method; Parameter analysis,Granular avalanches;Numerical simulation;Spectral multidomain penalty method;Parameter analysis;FREE-SURFACE FLOW;FINITE-MASS;EQUATIONS;MODEL;VISCOSITY;DEBRIS;MOTION;CHUTE,Colombia,2-s2.0-85079121704
,,,1,WOS:000647093300001,2021,Collecting specialty-related medical terms: Development and evaluation of a resource for Spanish,"Background: Controlled vocabularies are fundamental resources for information extraction from clinical texts using natural language processing (NLP). Standard language resources available in the healthcare domain such as the UMLS metathesaurus or SNOMED CT are widely used for this purpose, but with limitations such as lexical ambiguity of clinical terms. However, most of them are unambiguous within text limited to a given clinical specialty. This is one rationale besides others to classify clinical text by the clinical specialty to which they belong. Results: This paper addresses this limitation by proposing and applying a method that automatically extracts Spanish medical terms classified and weighted per sub-domain, using Spanish MEDLINE titles and abstracts as input. The hypothesis is biomedical NLP tasks benefit from collections of domain terms that are specific to clinical subdomains. We use PubMed queries that generate sub-domain specific corpora from Spanish titles and abstracts, from which token n-grams are collected and metrics of relevance, discriminatory power, and broadness per sub-domain are computed. The generated term set, called Spanish core vocabulary about clinical specialties (SCOVACLIS), was made available to the scientific community and used in a text classification problem obtaining improvements of 6 percentage points in the F-measure compared to the baseline using Multilayer Perceptron, thus demonstrating the hypothesis that a specialized term set improves NLP tasks. Conclusion: The creation and validation of SCOVACLIS support the hypothesis that specific term sets reduce the level of ambiguity when compared to a specialty-independent and broad-scope vocabulary.",Article,"Lopez-Ubeda, P.; Pomares-Quimbaya, A.; Diaz-Galiano, M.C.; Schulz, S.",Natural language processing; Vocabulary; Medical sub-language; Clinical specialty; Medical sub-domain,Natural language processing;Vocabulary;Medical sub-language;Clinical specialty;Medical sub-domain;INFORMATION EXTRACTION;TERMINOLOGY EXTRACTION;CLINICAL NOTES;ONTOLOGY;MODEL;CARE;CLASSIFICATION;IDENTIFICATION;DIAGNOSIS,Spain;Austria;Colombia,2-s2.0-85105306278

We build on the Inderst and Wambach (2001) model and assume that insurance is compulsory and involves a minimum premium and minimum coverage; these are common features in many health systems. In this setup we show that there is a range of equilibria, from the zero profit one where low-risks implicitly subsidize high risks, to one where firms obtain profits with both types of consumers. Moreover, we show that rents only partially dissipate if we assume free entry. Along these equilibria, high risks always obtain full insurance, while the low risks' coverage decreases as the firms' profits increase.",Article,"Willington, M.; Alegria, A.",adverse selection; collusion; insurance; capacity constraints,adverse selection;collusion;insurance;capacity constraints;EQUILIBRIUM;ECONOMIES;SCALE;SCOPE;MODEL,Chile;Colombia,2-s2.0-84908151950

For this, a new two-dimensional numerical biomorphodynamic model has been developed using the Telemac-Mascaret system. Considering the newest development in the topic, the effects of vegetation on bedload transport are included by extending Einstein's parameters for the sediment transport formula. The model was subsequently validated by published laboratory experiments reproducing alternate bar dynamics with different vegetation establishment scenarios. The validated model was then used to study the influence of vegetation patch patterns on the channel morphological evolution considering the two most observed ones: (a) the filled pattern with plants well distributed within the patch, and (b) the stripe pattern with plants established only along the patch edges. 14 scenarios were simulated in total, including sensitivity analyses on the coefficients of vegetation characteristics. The results indicate that the morphological responses of an alternate bar system to the stripe pattern consist of channel widening, steeper slope and reduced water depth, with increased sediment transport rates. The effects of the filled pattern are similar but weaker. The results also show that with the stripe pattern, the alternate bars tend to migrate toward the centerline forming center bars. Besides, the scroll bars forming downstream are shorter, corresponding to less visible chute channels, compared to the filled pattern. Despite much less vegetation coverage, the stripe pattern decreases the bar elongation rates in a way similar to the filled pattern.",Article,"Li, J.Z.; Claude, N.; Tassi, P.; Cordier, F.; Vargas-Luna, A.; Crosato, A.; Rodrigues, S.",,RIPARIAN VEGETATION;SEDIMENT TRANSPORT;FLOW;MODEL;BAR;RECRUITMENT;MECHANISMS;DIRECTION;SURVIVAL;SCOUR,France;Colombia;Netherlands,2-s2.0-85130586060

This volatility is driven by 'animal spirits' in that it arises from the feelings of optimism/pessimism independently of rational decision-making, and influences the liquidity available to each firm through the inter-firm payment network; consequently, some firms may enter financial distress. The model first determines the inter-firm payment network. Then, a mean-reverting square-root process introduces volatility into the inter-firm payment network through firms' propensity to pay suppliers according to the payments that firms expect to receive from customers. The model is calibrated for compatibility with relevant macro- and microeconomic stylized facts. According to computational experiments, financial distress in the business sector is minimized when feelings of optimism/pessimism generate the lowest volatility in firms' propensity to pay suppliers. In addition, this volatility must materialize around an intermediate value of firms' propensity to pay suppliers, and firms must keep this intermediate value over time.",Article,"Stellian, R.; Penagos, G.I.; Danna-Buitrago, J.P.",Financial distress; Inter-firm payment network; Animal spirits; Volatility; Agent-based model; Mean-reverting square-root process,Financial distress;Inter-firm payment network;Animal spirits;Volatility;Agent-based model;Mean-reverting square-root process;MODEL;RISK;MACROECONOMICS;DETERMINANTS;PREDICTION;ECONOMICS;ENSEMBLE;DYNAMICS;MARKET,Colombia,2-s2.0-85081549196;2-s2.0-85081549196

Since these events occur in unplanned and disrupting manner, to address them properly, it is required to manage real-time information and to have flexible reaction capacity. These capabilities, of data acquisition and robotics, are provided by Industry 4.0 Technologies. However, to take full advantage of those capabilities, it is imperative to have efficient decision-making processes to deliver adequate corrective actions. In this sense, we propose an event-driven rescheduling approach. This approach consists of an architecture that integrates information acquisition, optimization process, and rescheduling planning. We study the performance of the system with several algorithms with two performance criteria, namely, (i) relative performance deviation (RPD) in terms of objective function and (ii) schedule stability. We also propose a hybrid policy that combines full rescheduling regeneration with stability-oriented strategies aimed to balance both criteria. We conducted extensive computational tests with instances from the literature under different scenarios. The results show that a sophisticated algorithm can obtain better quality schedules in terms of the objective function but at the expense of sacrificing stability.

The instability line defines the onset of static liquefaction for loose sandy materials in the p-q space of effective stresses under undrained loading conditions. The onset of static liquefaction is predicted by means of a recently developed criterion and specialized to an elastoplastic constitutive model. The performance of this criterion is compared with laboratory tests showing satisfactory results. For a given void ratio and different mean pressures, it is found that the mobilized friction angle at the onset of static liquefaction is not constant. Therefore, the instability line is not an intrinsic property of the sand, but depends on the current state of the material.

Motorcyclists are the most vulnerable road users worldwide to road safety (28% of global fatalities), together with cyclists and pedestrians. Approximately 80% of deaths are from low- or middle-income countries. Colombia has a rate of 9.7 deaths per 100 000 inhabitants, which places it 10th in the world. Motorcycles in Colombia correspond to 57% of the fleet and generate an average of 51% of fatalities per year. This study aims to identify significant factors of the environment, traffic volume, and infrastructure to predict the number of accidents per year focused only on motorcyclists. The prediction model used a negative binomial regression for the definition of a Safety Performance Function (SPF) for motorcyclists. In the second stage, Bayes' empirical approach is implemented to identify motorcycle crash-prone road sections. The study is applied in Cartagena, one of the capital cities with more traffic crashes and motorcyclists dedicated to informal transportation (motorcycle taxi riders) in Colombia. The data of 2884 motorcycle crashes between 2016 and 2017 are analyzed. The proposed model identifies that crashes of motorcyclists per kilometer have significant factors such as the average volume of daily motorcyclist traffic, the number of accesses (intersections) per kilometer, commercial areas, and the type of road and it identifies 55 critical accident-prone sections.

OBJECTIVE: This study examined whether cognitive dysfunction and social disadaptation in individuals with TBI in Latin America at hospital discharge predict longitudinal trajectories of depression at baseline, 2 months, and 4 months. METHODS: A sample of 109 people with a new TBI was recruited from three hospitals: Mexico City, Mexico, Cali, Colombia and Neiva, Colombia. Participants completed measures of cognitive dysfunction and social disadaptation before hospital discharge and measures of depression at baseline, 2 months, and 4 months. RESULTS: Results suggested that depression scores were found to decrease over time in a quadratic (or U-shaped) fashion, and more significant cognitive dysfunction at hospital discharge was associated with higher longitudinal depression trajectories. Social disadaptation did not exert a unique effect on depression trajectories after controlling for cognitive dysfunction. Depression trajectories changed differentially over time as a function of baseline cognitive dysfunction, such that for those with high cognitive impairment, depression scores started high and then dropped to a moderated range and plateaued, but for individuals with low cognitive dysfunction, depression scores started lower and decreased linearly but moderately. CONCLUSIONS: The results suggest a strong need for neuropsychological assessments and evidence-based cognitive rehabilitation strategies to be implemented immediately after TBI in Latin America, which could exert salubrious effects on depression trajectories over time.",Article,"Cariello, A.N.; Perrin, P.B.; Agudelo, Y.R.; Plaza, S.L.O.; Quijano-Martinez, M.C.; Trujillo, M.A.; Arango-Lasprilla, J.C.",Traumatic brain injury; caregivers; depression; Latin America; rehabilitation,Traumatic brain injury;caregivers;depression;Latin America;rehabilitation;QUALITY-OF-LIFE;QUESTIONNAIRE EBIQ;BEHAVIOR;HEALTH;MODEL;INDIVIDUALS;MILD;IMPAIRMENT,United States;Mexico;Colombia;Spain,2-s2.0-85083312401;2-s2.0-85083312401

Supramolecular studies of the two compounds revealed the existence of weak C-Br horizontal ellipsis C(g)halogen bonds as well as weak C-H horizontal ellipsis O interactions in the first oxime derivative and even weaker interactions dominated by dispersion forces in the second derivative. These interactions were further analyzed by observing the Hirshfeld surfaces. To evaluate the features of the halogen interactions, molecular electrostatic studies (MEP) were performed. These studies showed positive charges on the surface of the halogen atom, demonstrating the presence of a ""sigma hole"". The maximum and minimum values of the molecular electrostatic potential indicate low molecular reactivity, and difficult access of the electrophilic or nucleophilic agents to the molecule, in the case of a hypothetical reaction, is observed. Spectroscopic studies in the IR region showed similar results for the two compounds, finding specific differences in the behavior of the N-O and N=C frequencies that characterize the oxime group. UV-visible spectra of both compounds were also recorded and the electronic properties, such as HOMO, LUMO and band gap energies were measured by time-dependent DFT (TD-DFT) approach.

Eighteen open-ended interviews were conducted to supervisors from first, second, and third-wave behavioral therapies. These were analyzed based on an ethnographic approach. Participants reported an average of 17-years (SD =9.85) practicing as clinicians and 16-years (SD =10.51) as supervisors. The Altlas.ti 6.2 software was employed to analyze and synthesize the central processes embedded in supervision. Results found behavioral oriented supervision as the core category which encloses the following two axial subcategories: factors influencing supervision and supervision process.

Design and setting: We designed a retrospective, observational cohort study, which included all patients aged between a month and 17 years and 364 days, admitted to the pediatric intensive care unit of a high complexity university hospital between April 1, 2016 and December 31, 2018. We analyzed the standardized mortality ratio, discrimination, calibration, and net reclassification index (NRI) for each model. Results: A total of 722 patients were included, the mortality rate was 3.74%, and for PIM-3, the ratio between expected and observed mortality was 0.66 [confidence interval (CI) 0.40-1.05] for PIM-2 and 1.00 (CI 0.59-1.68) for PIM-3. The Hosmer-Lemeshow (HL) test suggests inadequate calibration for PIM-2 (HL = 13.18, p = 0.11) and adequate calibration for PIM-3 (HL = 28.08, p < 0.01). The area under the diagnostic performance curves for PIM-2 and PIM-3 were 0.87 (95% CI 0.80-0.94) and 0.89 (95% CI 0.82-0.95), respectively. The NRI was -27.1%. PIM-3 classified survivors better than PIM-2, but inadequately classified nonsurvivors.

It is characterized by involvement in the nerves that produce a pain like rush, burn or stitch. This neuropathic pain has been associated with a high risk of anxiety in patients with it, thus generating a more significant economic burden in patients with symptomatic diabetic neuropathy. Aim: To describe current literature on the relationship between symptomatic diabetic Neuropathy and the risk of concomitant anxiety symptoms. Method: We carried out a similar search by four reviewers in the Ovid, Pubmed, SciELO, and Cochrane databases. Results: Of the 1140 articles found, 56 were evaluated in full text. A varied prevalence of anxious and depressive symptoms was found in patients with symptomatic diabetic neuropathy, evaluated using different questionnaires and scales. Some studies found an association between anxiety symptoms, sleep disorders, and inadequate glycemic control. Early education and the management of neuropathic pain have been reported as factors of good prognosis, the latter being the determinants of quality of life and productivity in patients with symptomatic diabetic neuropathy. Conclusion: The relationship between diabetic neuropathy and anxiety symptoms can be bidirectional.

Therefore, in Bogota a home-visit based program was instituted to increase screening uptake. However, around 40% of the visited women fail to attend their Pap smear test appointments. Using this program as a case study, this paper presents a methodology that combines machine learning methods, using routinely collected administrative data, with Champion's Health Belief Model to assess women's beliefs about cervical cancer screening. The aim is to improve the cost-effectiveness of behavioural interventions aiming to increase attendance for screening. The results presented here relate specifically to the case study, but the methodology is generic and can be applied in all low-income settings. Methods This is a cross-sectional study using two different datasets from the same population and a sequential modelling approach. To assess beliefs, we used a 37-item questionnaire to measure the constructs of the CHBM towards cervical cancer screening. Data were collected through a face-to-face survey (N = 1699). We examined instrument reliability using Cronbach's coefficient and performed a principal component analysis to assess construct validity. Then, Kruskal-Wallis and Dunn tests were conducted to analyse differences on the HBM scores, among patients with different poverty levels. Next, we used data retrieved from administrative health records (N = 23,370) to fit a LASSO regression model to predict individual no-show probabilities. Finally, we used the results of the CHBM in the LASSO model to improve its accuracy. Results Nine components were identified accounting for 57.7% of the variability of our data. Lower income patients were found to have a lower Health motivation score (p-value < 0.001), a higher Severity score (p-value < 0.001) and a higher Barriers score (p-value < 0.001). Additionally, patients between 25 and 30 years old and with higher poverty levels are less likely to attend their appointments (O.R 0.93 (CI: 0.83-0.98) and 0.74 (CI: 0.66-0.85), respectively). We also found a relationship between the CHBM scores and the patient attendance probability. Average AUROC score for our prediction model is 0.9. Conclusion In the case of Bogota, our results highlight the need to develop education campaigns to address misconceptions about the disease mortality and treatment (aiming at decreasing perceived severity), particularly among younger patients living in extreme poverty. Additionally, it is important to conduct an economic evaluation of screening options to strengthen the cervical cancer screening program (to reduce perceived barriers).

This sudden change caused a break in the daily life of thousands of university students, who were forced to use a teaching method that, although not new, was unusual at that time. This, initially generated a situation of rejection, stress and a perception of low quality classes that were received in a virtual way. However, with the passage of time, there was a need to know the perception of students about the quality of their virtual classes, but once the mandatory quarantine ended, because the liter-ature has been focused only during the quarantine period. On the other hand, most studies on this topic have focused on developed countries, so there is little literature on the perception of virtual classes, taken by students from South America, whose countries have economic, social and technological characteristics, very different from developed countries. Based on the above, this study analyzes the perceptions of 867 students from 12 private business schools in the city of Bogota, Colombia. The data processed through PLS, allows us to observe that students have changed their negative perception towards virtual classes, and that, at present, these classes are considered of quality.

Such wide clinical behaviour can be attributed to its phenotypical plasticity and high genetic diversity. This study characterised 10 Colombian clinical isolates which had already been identified as C. albicans by molecular tests; however, previous bioinformatics analysis of protein mass spectra and phenotypical characteristics has shown that this group of isolates has atypical behaviour, sharing characteristics of both C. africana and C. albicans. This study was aimed at evaluating atypical isolates' pathogenic capability in the Galleria mellonella model; susceptibility profiles were determined and MLST was used for molecular characterisation. Cluster analysis, enabling unbiased bootstrap to classify the isolates and establish their cluster membership and e-BURST, was used for establishing clonal complexes (CC). Both approaches involved using representative MLST data from the 18 traditional C. albicans clades, as well as C. albicans-associated and minor species. Ten atypical isolates were distributed as follows: 6/10 (B71, B41, B60, R6, R41, and R282) were grouped into a statistically well-supported atypical cluster (AC) and constituted a differentiated CC 6; 2/10 of the isolates were clearly grouped in clade 1 and were concurrent in CC 4 (B80, B44). Another 2/10 atypical isolates were grouped in clade 10 and concurred in CC 7 (R425, R111); most atypical isolates were related to geographically distant isolates and some represented new ST. Isolates B41 and R41 in the AC had greater virulence. Isolate B44 was fluconazole-resistant and was grouped in clade 1. The atypical nature of the isolates studied here was demonstrated by the contrast between phenotypical traits (C. africana-like), molecular markers (C. albicans-like), virulence, and antifungal resistance, highlighting the widely described genetic plasticity for this genus. Our results showed that the atypical isolates forming well-differentiated groups belonged to C. albicans.

Random and preferential attachment are widely-used mechanisms, which assume that as new social actors attach to a network, they establish a fixed number of new connections. Our work extends the class of random and preferential attachment models by considering scenarios in which the number of new connections may vary over time. For the original attachment mechanisms, we show that infinite-dimensional time-varying linear systems characterize the evolution of the cumulative degree distributions. Moreover, we show that the limit average degrees and the limit degree distributions are stable invariants. The stability of these sets implies that small perturbations to the network can only lead to small variations in the two topological measures at any point in time. Simulations illustrate how random and targeted perturbations impact the invariants. Finally, we present analogous results for preferential attachment models in which the number of new connections is defined by random variables obeying a binomial or power law probability function.",Article,"Fernandez, I.; Passino, K.M.; Finke, J.",evolving networks; network theory and computer sciences; mathematical and numerical analysis of networks; preferential attachment; random attachment; stability; structural analysis of networks,evolving networks;network theory and computer sciences;mathematical and numerical analysis of networks;preferential attachment;random attachment;stability;structural analysis of networks;ROBUSTNESS;MODEL,United States;Colombia,2-s2.0-85068715091;2-s2.0-85068715091;2-s2.0-85068715091

However, firms may exert influence on the local structure of the product attribute space by offering product variants with new attributes. As a result, the geometry of the product attribute space would change endogenously through firms' actions, and this emergent new geometry modifies the conditions for subsequent firm behavior. By focusing on this interplay between actors and conditions, we explore the co-evolution of the firm and the product attribute space. Through a multi-variant Cournot competition framework, we develop a computational model in which firms invest to differentiate their products from other variants, but as minimally as possible so that demand from closely similar existing variants can be stolen. We introduce the fraction dimensionality of the attribute space as our critical independent variable, to reflect saturation of the space with product varieties. The simulation reveals that while new product variants are typically introduced by firms with scale economies, their performance gap with firms without scale economies reduces as fraction dimensionality increases. This indicates that space geometry evolution may favor small-scale players, even when their large-scale competitors are the driving force behind attribute space changes.",Article,"Garcia-Diaz, C.; Peli, G.; van Witteloostuijn, A.",,DEVELOPMENT EXTERNALITIES;COMPLEX DYNAMICS;LINE LENGTH;MODEL;COMPETITION;OLIGOPOLY;INDUSTRY;DUOPOLY;INTERDEPENDENCY;DIMENSIONALITY,Colombia;Hungary;Netherlands;Belgium,2-s2.0-85086525041

However, it is unclear whether the uptake of metals affects their pathogenicity. This study aimed to evaluate the effect of iron/copper in modulating pathogenicity and proteomic response in two clinical isolates of C. neoformans with high and low pathogenicity. Methods: In both isolates, the effect of 50 mu M iron and 500 mu M copper on pathogenicity, capsule induction, and melanin production was evaluated. We then performed a quantitative proteomic analysis of cytoplasmic extracts exposed to that combination. Finally, the effect on pathogenicity by iron and copper was evaluated in eight additional isolates. Results: In both isolates, the combination of iron and copper increased pathogenicity, capsule size, and melanin production. Regarding proteomic data, proteins with increased levels after iron and copper exposure were related to biological processes such as cell stress, vesicular traffic (Ap1, Vps35), cell wall structure (Och1, Ccr4, Gsk3), melanin biosynthesis (Hem15, Mln2), DNA repair (Chk1), protein transport (Mms2), SUMOylation (Uba2), and mitochondrial transport (Atm1).

Here, we provide the first attempt, to our knowledge, to quantify predictability and uncertainty during succession based on the most extensive long-term datasets ever assembled for Neotropical forests. We develop a novel approach that integrates deterministic and stochastic components into different candidate models describing the dynamical interactions among three widely used and interrelated forest attributes-stem density, basal area, and species density. Within each of the seven study sites, successional trajectories were highly idiosyncratic, even when controlling for prior land use, environment, and initial conditions in these attributes. Plot factors were far more important than stand age in explaining successional trajectories. For each site, the best-fit model was able to capture the complete set of time series in certain attributes only when both the deterministic and stochastic components were set to similar magnitudes. Surprisingly, predictability of stem density, basal area, and species density did not show consistent trends across attributes, study sites, or land use history, and was independent of plot size and time series length. The model developed here represents the best approach, to date, for characterizing autogenic successional dynamics and demonstrates the low predictability of successional trajectories.

We document 142 dams existing or under construction and 160 proposed dams for rivers draining the Andean headwaters of the Amazon. Existing dams have fragmented the tributary networks of six of eight major Andean Amazon river basins. Proposed dams could result in significant losses in river connectivity in river mainstems of five of eightmajor systems-the Napo, Maranon, Ucayali, Beni, and Mamore. With a newly reported 671 freshwater fish species inhabiting the Andean headwaters of the Amazon (>500 m), dams threaten previously unrecognized biodiversity, particularly among endemic and migratory species.

The extraction of DNA from sediment samples and the direct application of pyrosequencing resulted in approximately 215 Mb of data from four distinct mangrove areas (BrMgv01 to 04) in Brazil. The taxonomic approaches applied revealed the dominance of Deltaproteobacteria and Gammaproteobacteria in the samples. Paired statistical analysis showed higher proportions of specific taxonomic groups in each dataset. The metabolic reconstruction indicated the possible occurrence of processes modulated by the prevailing conditions found in mangrove sediments. In terms of carbon cycling, the sequences indicated the prevalence of genes involved in the metabolism of methane, formaldehyde, and carbon dioxide. With respect to the nitrogen cycle, evidence for sequences associated with dissimilatory reduction of nitrate, nitrogen immobilization, and denitrification was detected. Sequences related to the production of adenylsulfate, sulfite, and H2S were relevant to the sulphur cycle. These data indicate that the microbial core involved in methane, nitrogen, and sulphur metabolism consists mainly of Burkholderiaceae, Planctomycetaceae, Rhodobacteraceae, and Desulfobacteraceae.

Local studies of distributions along elevational gradients reveal small-scale patterns but do not allow generalizations among geographic regions or taxa. We critically assessed data from 249 studies of species elevational distributions in the American, African, and Asia-Pacific tropics. Of these, 150 had sufficient data quality, sampling intensity, elevational range, and freedom from serious habitat disturbance to permit robust across-study comparisons. We found four main patterns: (1) species classified as elevational specialists (upper- or lower-zone specialists) are relatively more frequent in the American than Asia-Pacific tropics, with African tropics being intermediate; (2) elevational specialists are rare on islands, especially oceanic and smaller continental islands, largely due to a paucity of upper-zone specialists; (3) a relatively high proportion of plants and ectothermic vertebrates (amphibians and reptiles) are upper-zone specialists; and (4) relatively few endothermic vertebrates (birds and mammals) are upper-zone specialists. Understanding these broad-scale trends will help identify taxa and geographic regions vulnerable to global warming and highlight future research priorities. (C) 2010 Elsevier Ltd.

,,,97,WOS:000307302400007,2012,Demographic drivers of successional changes in phylogenetic structure across life-history stages in plant communities,"To gain insight into the ecological processes driving community reassembly in disturbed ecosystems, we assessed the phylogenetic dispersion of early- and late-successional tree species occurring in lowland forests of northeastern Costa Rica. Early-successional species were more closely related than expected by chance, whereas late-successional species tended to be less closely related than expected by chance. Then, we evaluated temporal changes in the phylogenetic structure of seedling and tree assemblages in four 1-ha plots of secondary forests in this region. We found an increase in the phylogenetic evenness among tree individuals over time in all secondary tree assemblages, indicating that relatedness among tree individuals decreases as succession unfolds. This pattern was jointly promoted by recruitment and mortality processes, suggesting that increasing evenness was caused by the replacement of individuals of early-successional species from closely related lineages by late-successional species belonging to a wider diversity of lineages. Based on species occurrence, however, tree community reassembly did not show any significant phylogenetic trend over time. These results suggest that shifts in species abundance over succession have a greater impact on the phylogenetic structure of the community than the turnover of species. Seedling assemblages showed higher phylogenetic evenness than tree assemblages, suggesting that propagule colonization is an important process driving phylogenetic changes in species composition throughout succession. Overall, our findings showed that the phylogenetic structure of these successional communities varies at two temporal scales. At short timescales, decreased dominance by early-successional species over succession leads to increased evenness among tree individuals. At longer timescales, colonization processes result in increased phylogenetic evenness in seedling communities compared to tree communities, forecasting increasing phylogenetic evenness among adult individuals at late-successional stages.",Article,"Norden, N.; Letcher, S.G.; Boukili, V.; Swenson, N.G.; Chazdon, R.",community assembly; Costa Rica; life-history stages of plants; mortality; phylogenetic structure; recruitment; succession; vegetation dynamics,community assembly;Costa Rica;life-history stages of plants;mortality;phylogenetic structure;recruitment;succession;vegetation dynamics;TROPICAL SECONDARY FORESTS;NEOTROPICAL FOREST;SEEDLING COMMUNITIES;TREE COMMUNITIES;FUNCTIONAL TRAIT;NEUTRAL THEORY;WOOD DENSITY;RAIN-FORESTS;DIVERSITY;DYNAMICS,Colombia;United States;Costa Rica,2-s2.0-84859732960

This acidic spring had a diverse community composed mainly of Bacteria that shared characteristics with those from other hot springs and extreme acidic environments. The microbial community was dominated by Proteobacteria, Firmicutes, and Planctomycetes and contained chemotrophic bacteria potentially involved in cycling of ferrous and sulfur-containing minerals and phototrophic organisms, most of which were eukaryotic micro-algae. Despite the presence of a large proportion of novel, unclassified sequences, the taxonomic profiles obtained with each strategy showed similarities at higher taxonomic levels. However, some groups, such as Spirochaetes and Aquificae, were identified using only one methodology, and more taxa were detected with the gene array, which also shared more groups with the pyrosequencing data.

We compared the geographical discrepancies and potential conservation implications of using two different climate models (Saga and Worldclim) in combination with the species modelling approach Maxent in Bolivia. We estimated ranges of selected bird and fern species biogeographically restricted to either humid montane forest of the northern Bolivian Andes or seasonal dry tropical forests (in the Andes and southern lowlands). Saga and Worldclim predicted roughly similar climate patterns of temperature that were significantly correlated. Precipitation layers of both climate models were also roughly similar, but showed important differences. Species ranges estimated with Worldclim and Saga likewise produced different results. Ranges of species endemic to humid montane forests estimated with Saga had higher AUC (Area under the curve) values than those estimated with Worldclim, which for example predicted the occurrence of humid montane forest bird species near Lake Titicaca, an area that is clearly unsuitable for these species. Likewise, Worldclim overpredicted the occurrence of fern and bird species in the lowlands of the Chapare region and well south of the Andean Elbow, where more seasonal biomes occur. By contrast, Saga predictions were coherent with the known distribution of humid montane forests in the northern Bolivian Andes. Estimated ranges of species endemic to seasonal dry tropical forests predicted with Saga and Worldclim were not statistically different in most cases. However, detailed comparisons revealed that Saga was able to distinguish fragments of seasonal dry tropical forests in rain-shadow valleys of the northern Bolivian Andes, whereas Worldclim was not. These differences highlight the neglected influence of climate layers on modelling results and the importance of using the most accurate climate data available when modelling species distributions.

These studies have reported a monotonic decrease in species richness with increasing elevation, but ignore the high taxonomic differentiation of each headwater assemblage that may generate high -diversity among them. Here, we analyzed how fish assemblages vary with elevation among regional elevation bands, and how these changes are related to four environmental clines and to changes in the distribution, habitat use, and the morphology of fish species. Using a standardized field sampling technique, we assessed three different diversity and two structural assemblage measures across six regional elevation bands located in the northern Andes (Colombia). Each species was assigned to a functional group based on its body shape, habitat use, morphological, and/or behavioral adaptations. Additionally, at each sampling site, we measured four environmental variables. Our analyses showed: (1) After a monotonic decrease in species richness, we detected an increase in richness in the upper part of the gradient; (2) diversity patterns vary depending on the diversity measure used; (3) diversity patterns can be attributed to changes in species distribution and in the richness and proportions of functional groups along the regional elevation gradient; and (4) diversity patterns and changes in functional groups are highly correlated with variations in environmental variables, which also vary with elevation.

A classification of unassembled metagenomic reads using different databases showed a high proportion of Gammaproteobacteria and Alphaproteobacteria (in total read affiliation), and through taxonomic affiliation of 16S rRNA gene fragments we observed the presence of Proteobacteria, micro-algae chloroplast and Firmicutes. Reads mapped against the genomes Acidiphilium cryptum JF-5, Legionella pneumophila str. Corby and Acidithiobacillus caldus revealed the presence of transposase-like sequences, potentially involved in horizontal gene transfer. Functional annotation and hierarchical comparison with different datasets obtained by pyrosequencing in different ecosystems showed that the microbial community also contained extensive DNA repair systems, possibly to cope with ultraviolet radiation at such high altitudes. Analysis of genes involved in the nitrogen cycle indicated the presence of dissimilatory nitrate reduction to N2 (narGHI, nirS, norBCDQ and nosZ), associated with Proteobacteria-like sequences. Genes involved in the sulfur cycle (cysDN, cysNC and aprA) indicated adenylsulfate and sulfite production that were affiliated to several bacterial species. In summary, metagenomic sequence data provided insight regarding the structure and possible functions of this hot spring microbial community, describing some groups potentially involved in the nitrogen and sulfur cycling in this environment.

Such studies are based on restriction site and intergenic deletion/insertion polymorphisms, which define four main haplotype groups common to Asian and American populations. Several studies have characterized these lineages in North, Central, and South American Amerindian, as well as Na Dene and Aleutian populations. Siberian, Central Asian, and Southeast Asian populations have also been analyzed, in the hope of fully depicting the route(s) of migration between Asia and America. Colombia, a key route of migration between North and South America, has until now not been studied. To resolve the current lack of information about Colombian Amerindian populations, we have investigated the presence of the founder haplogroups in 25 different ethnic groups from all over the country. The present research is part of an interdisciplinary program, Expedicion Humana, fostered by the Universidad Javeriana and Dr. J. E. Bernal V. The results show the presence of the four founder A-D Amerindian lineages, with varied distributions in the different populations, as well as the presence of other haplotypes in frequencies ranging from 3% to 26%. These include some unique or private polymorphisms, and also indicate the probable presence of other Asian and a few non-Amerindian lineages. A spatial structure is apparent for haplogroups A and D, and to a lesser extent for haplogroup C. While haplogroup A and D frequencies in Colombian populations from the northwestern side of the Andes resemble those seen in Central American Amerindians more than those seen in South American populations, their frequencies on the southeastern side more closely resemble the bulk of South American frequencies so far reported, raising the question as to whether they reflect more than one migration route into South America.

However, few studies focus on forest edges, created during the fragmentation process, as proximate drivers of the local demographic structure of populations. Here, we use abundance data of amphibians and reptiles to study their responses to forest edges in nine fragmented forested landscapes of the Neotropics. Species-specific abundance data were collected in plots established at varying distances from their respective nearest forest edge. We tested for edge effects on the abundance of species, and used curve clustering techniques to group species with similar edge responses, i.e. species with either increasing or decreasing abundance from the matrix towards the forest interior. We also grouped species that showed no change in abundance with respect to the nearest forest edge and those whose abundance response was unimodal, peaking in either forest habitat or the surrounding matrix habitat. We found that 96% of all amphibians and 90% of all reptiles showed an edge response, with the abundance of 74.5% of amphibians and 57.3% of reptiles decreasing with increasing proximity to forest edges. However, species-specific edge effects were not always consistent, with some species having opposite edge responses when measured in different landscapes. The depth of edge effects exhibited by forest species, i.e. species that increased in abundance in the forest interior, extended up to one kilometre away from forest edges. We show that the median edge effect on forest species extends to 250 m within the forest interior, indicating that tropical forest patches with a mean diameter < 500 m (minimum area approximate to 78 ha) are unsuitable for half of forest-dependent species considered in this study.

We studied the influence of live fence characteristics on species richness and fence use by birds by examining both local and landscape factors. We studied three types of live fences: planted fences of a native tree, planted fences of an exotic, and spontaneous. They were either connected to forest fragments or isolated, and were all within a pasture matrix. Spontaneous and planted live fences maintain a diverse plant (77 shrub and tree species) and bird communities (98 species). Fence types strongly differed in vegetation composition and structure. We found that by analyzing each fence characteristic independently, there was no difference in bird richness or abundance. However, there was a significant correlation when plant richness, structure, and connectivity were analyzed together. This could be the result of some variables counterbalancing each other. Birds used fences for a variety of purposes including foraging, breeding, and moving across the landscape. Native birds and plants used live fences as habitat and refuge in a landscape where large forest tracts have been lost for decades. Live fences in conjunction with small forest fragments maintain a diverse array of plant and birds species that are a subsample of the species originally found in the landscape before extensive deforestation.

In response, multi-canopy intensive silvopastoral systems (ISS), which includes herbs, shrubs and trees, have been developed to provide local fodder sources for livestock while reducing the need for external inputs with a goal to conserve landscapes and improve soil quality. However, there is limited information on the temporal responsiveness of ISS to deliver ecosystem services as reflected in soil microbial properties. Therefore, the objective of this study was to examine the shifts of total and ammonia-oxidizing bacteria (AOB) communities along an ISS chronosequence (ranging from 3 to 15 years since establishment), in comparison to CP and native F and investigate P. juliflora trees as a resource island relative to soil microbial properties. Denaturing gradient gel electrophoresis (DGGE) fingerprints of 16S rRNA gene (total bacteria) as well as amoA gene (ammonia-oxidizing bacteria) (AOB) indicated that soil bacterial communities varied between the land uses, with higher similarities between F and ISS communities, in comparison to CP. The abundance and nitrification potential of ammonia oxidizers were significantly higher in CP and lower in F. In addition, the bacterial communities across ISS chronosequence were more similar between older (ISS-12) and intermediate (ISS-8) systems in comparison with youngest systems (ISS-3). Finally, the canopy of P. juliflora tree did not have an impact on structure of total bacterial community; though, it did have an effect on the structure of AOB communities. Our study suggests that ISS might restore some of the ecosystem services offered by soil microbial communities.

However, changes in characteristics of the surrounding urban morphology could influence the contribution of such green spaces. In particular, bird communities inhabiting small urban parks (SUPs) may be vulnerable, given the high exposure of these spaces to surrounding conditions. In Neotropical cities, the influence of urban-matrix characteristics on bird communities found in SUPs is relatively unknown. In this study, we explored if an increase in surrounding urban matrix variables, such as building densities, average building height, and road coverage around SUPs, negatively influenced the richness and abundance of the bird communities inhabiting them. We tested the effects of matrix and several site-level variables (e.g., vegetation diversity) across 60 SUPs in Santiago, Chile. As the matrix around a SUP had increased building densities, bird richness and abundance of native and insectivorous species decreased and invasive, urban-dweller, and omnivorous species increased. As road coverage increased, both the richness and abundance tended to decrease across all bird categories. For site-level variables, SUP size, distance to nearest SUP, and native vegetation diversity had a significant effect on several bird categories. Our results indicate that city planners may need to take into account both the surrounding urban matrix and site-level characteristics in order to improve bird diversity within SUPs.",Article,"Amaya-Espinel, J.D.; Hostetler, M.; Henriquez, C.; Bonacic, C.",Urban matrix; Urban densification; Avian communities; Urban biodiversity; Green Infrastructure,Urban matrix;Urban densification;Avian communities;Urban biodiversity;Green Infrastructure;LAND-USE CHANGES;BIODIVERSITY;URBANIZATION;DIVERSITY;LANDSCAPE;ASSEMBLAGES;RESPONSES;DYNAMICS;GRADIENT;SANTIAGO,Colombia;Chile;United States,2-s2.0-85066492756

The genetic structure of this population was evaluated using 12 microsatellite loci (n = 62 samples). In addition, 22 jaguar DNA samples from Guatemala, Paraguay, Peru, Bolivia, Venezuela and Brazil were analyzed for these microsatellite loci (n = 84 samples). The results of this study indicate six primary themes. First, the levels of gene diversity were very high. Second, the majority of the loci analyzed showed an absence of Hardy-Weinberg equilibrium, probably due to the Wahlund effect (= population subdivision). Third, several microsatellite loci showed significant heterogeneity between the two supposed subspecies in the country. Nevertheless, gene flow was present between them, and heterogeneity was relatively low, although the assignment analyses showed good classification of the jaguars studied into their respective subspecies. Fourth, the long-term historical effective population sizes were calculated through a maximum likelihood procedure for single and multi-step mutation models. Fifth, seven out of twelve DNA microsatellites studied significantly deviated from a single-step mutation model. However, the overall mean multi-step mutation percentage for these 12 DNA microsatellites was only 6%. Therefore, 94% of mutations were uni-step.

The study of the interaction between edge and matrix effects in nature is essential to understand and promote the colonization of some functional groups in managed ecosystems. We studied the dynamics of 7 species of frogs and salamanders occurring in 8 ecotones of tropical montane cloud forest (TMCF) which interact with adjacent managed areas of coffee and corn plantations in Guerrero, southern Mexico. A survey effort of 196 man/hours along 72 transects detected 58 individuals of 7 amphibian species and 12 environmental and structural variables were measured. The diversity and abundance of amphibians in the forest mostly depended on the matrix context adjacent to the forest patches. The forest interior provided higher relative humidity, leaf litter cover, and canopy cover that determined the presence of some amphibian species. The use of shaded coffee plantations was preferred by the amphibians over the corn plots possibly due to the maintenance of native forest arboreal elements, low management rate and less intensity of disturbance in the coffee plantations than in the corn plots. Shaded coffee plantations reduce the edge effects in TMCF, improve the connectivity between TMCF fragments and increase habitat quality for the forest interior amphibian species. Future wildlife management research should take into account edge and matrix effects to understand species dynamics which move along anthropogenic-natural ecotones in managed ecosystems, thus prioritizing sites to buffer edge effects and increase habitat quality in remaining natural ecosystems.",Article,"Santos-Barrera, G.; Urbina-Cardona, J.N.",amphibians; conservation; edge effects; environmental gradients; shaded coffee plantations; tropical montane cloud forest; vegetation structure,amphibians;conservation;edge effects;environmental gradients;shaded coffee plantations;tropical montane cloud forest;vegetation structure;COFFEE AGROECOSYSTEMS;HABITAT;FOREST;DIVERSITY;MICROENVIRONMENT;BIODIVERSITY;VERACRUZ;SYSTEMS;DECLINE;TRENDS,Colombia;Mexico,2-s2.0-79960539593

We asked whether its success might be partly explained by its mycorrhizal associations, hypothesizing a relationship with many fungal partners or with one widely distributed partner. METHODS: Oeceoclades maculata roots were collected throughout Puerto Rico, and the degree of mycorrhizal colonization was measured. For identification of fungi, the ITS region was sequenced from pure cultures and directly from roots. Representative fungi were used for symbiotic seed germination experiments. KEY RESULTS: Colonization of O. maculata roots was very variable. The most common fungus identified by BLAST searches was Psathyrella cf. candolleana, but typical orchid mycorrhizal fungi (Ceratobasidium and Tulasnella) were also found, as were a range of saprotrophs. Seeds germinated in vitro only in the presence of Psathyrella. CONCLUSIONS: These results are surprising in two respects. First, O. maculata appears to be highly specific for fungi during seed germination, but unusually promiscuous as adult plants. Second, mycorrhizal associations with Psathyrella and with other saprotrophic fungi have been previously reported, but only from mycoheterotrophic (i.e., nonphotosynthetic) orchids, not from green orchids like Oeceoclades.

Neither the overall sample nor the samples coming from each of the Countries analyzed were in Hardy-Weinberg equilibrium. This is attributable to the Wahlund effect caused by a fragmentation of the bear populations. The genetic variability levels found were in general low for this kind of molecular markers (H = 0.38 for the global population). The situation of the Ecuadorian bear population seems to be endangered (H = 0.24). This is the lowest level recorded for any bear population. The genetic heterogeneity among the three populations was large and highly significant (F-ST = 0.39; R-ST = 0.32-0.49). Likewise, the gene flow estimates were remarkably low among these populations (Nm = 0.2-0.3). This means that the populations are strongly isolated. Different methods were applied to determine the effective numbers in these Populations. A significant spatial structure of the genotypes was analyzed with different procedures. In all cases, an isolation-by-distance structure was detected. This could be a consequence of the original South America colonization. There was no evidence for a recent genetic bottleneck. This could mean that the low heterozygosity and the population fragmentation could be explained by ancient events related to the bear colonization, with the arrival of humans beings in the Americas, and/or with the glacial maximum, 16.000-30.000 years ago.",Article,"Ruiz-Garcia, M.",,SPANISH CAT POPULATIONS;ALLELE FREQUENCY DATA;MICROSATELLITE ANALYSIS;RARE ALLELES;DOMESTIC CAT;2 TESTS;DIVERSITY;DISTANCE;FLOW;SUBDIVISION,Colombia,

Understory species diversity, tree regeneration, and soil physicochemical characteristics were assessed under three planting densities of Pinus massoniana in Taizishan Mountains, Hubei, China. There was a higher degree of shrub and herb species diversity in lower density stands. Total species richness was higher for herbs (n = 42) than for shrubs (n = 30) but the two groups exhibited a similar pattern with greater species richness at lower stand density. Changes in community structure and composition were more frequent in high density stands. Community structure in low and medium density stands was more similar to one another than to high stand densities for both herbs and shrubs. The regeneration status of tree species was more abundant in low and medium density stands. Low and medium density stands had significantly more favorable chemical properties such as soil organic matter, total phosphorus, available phosphorus, and nitrogen, as well as on physical soil properties such as non-capillary pores and minimum water holding capacity. Lower planting density was beneficial with regard to natural regeneration, plant species diversity, and soil quality. Reducing tree density of existing high-density P. massoniana plantations can promote both understory plant species diversity and tree regeneration to sustain forest ecosystem services.

To date, research has provided limited data on the possible association between an active lifestyle and a healthy composition of human microbiota. This review was aimed to summarize the results of human studies comparing the microbiome of healthy individuals with different physical activity amounts. Methods We searched Medline/Ovid, NIH/PubMed, and Academic Search Complete between August-October 2020. Inclusion criteria comprised: (a) cross-sectional studies focused on comparing gut microbiome among subjects with different physical activity levels; (b) studies describing human gut microbiome responses to any type of exercise stimulus; (c) studies containing healthy adult women and men. We excluded studies containing diet modifications, probiotic or prebiotic consumption, as well as studies focused on diabetes, hypertension, cancer, hormonal dysfunction. Methodological quality and risk of bias for each study were assessed using the Risk Of Bias In Non-randomized Studies-of Interventions tool. The results from cross-sectional and longitudinal studies are shown independently. Results A total of 17 articles were eligible for inclusion: ten cross-sectional and seven longitudinal studies. Main outcomes vary significantly according to physical activity amounts in longitudinal studies. We identified discrete changes in diversity indexes and relative abundance of certain bacteria in active people. Conclusion As literature in this field is rapidly growing, it is important that studies incorporate diverse methods to evaluate other aspects related to active lifestyles such as sleep and dietary patterns.

Seven of them were polymorphic, which led us to investigate several population-genetic parameters. Private alleles and significant differences in gene frequencies were found among the populations studied, which demonstrated the extent of genetic differentiation among the spectacled bear populations. The levels of gene diversity measured with these microsatellites were rather modest in this species. Hardy-Weinberg disequilibrium was especially found for the overall and the Ecuadorian samples, and might be due to the Wahlund effect or consanguinity.

This structure is hypothesized to be an ancestral trait, suggesting that similar diets would be observed throughout a species' range. However, most evidence comes from lowlands where data from montane habitats are scarce. In high mountain environments both diversity of bats and plants decreases with altitude; such decline in plant diversity produces less plants to feed from, which should ultimately affect the trophic structure of frugivorous bats in mountain environments. Here, we present a comprehensive review of the diet of frugivorous bats in Neotropical montane environments and evaluate their trophic structure in middle and higher elevations by combining a literature database with field data. We use the concept of modularity to test whether frugivorous montane bats have dietary preferences on core plant taxa. Our database revealed 47 species of montane bats feeding on 211 plant species. We find that the networks are modular, reflecting the trophic structure previously reported.

Eight environmental and structural variables were measured to characterize the species' habitats and to determine which was most important in structuring amphibian patterns. After a total of 432 man-hours sampling effort, 513 individuals from 32 amphibian species were found. Although the species richness was similar among the vegetation cover types, the composition of the ensembles and total amphibian abundance were different in each case. In addition, a strong relationship was found between changes in the vegetation structure and the amphibian pattern, with the canopy cover being the key variable in the composition of the ensembles for each cover type. Habitats with over 76% canopy cover, combined with a high density of individual woody plants (> 176 individuals per 500 m(2)) and a high depth of leaf litter (> 16 cm), provide the necessary habitat conditions for typical rainforest composition of amphibian species. However, for amphibian ensembles to have a mature forest composition, the habitat must have a canopy cover over 89%, a density of woody plants exceeding 231 individuals per 500 m2, and a leaf litter depth above 23 cm.

Unlike most other organism groups, plant species can possess dormant life-history stages such as soil seed banks, which may help plant communities to resist or at least postpone the detrimental impact of global changes. This study investigates the potential for soil seed banks to achieve this. Location Europe. Time period 1978-2014. Major taxa studied Flowering plants. Methods Using a space-for-time/warming approach, we study plant species richness and composition in the herb layer and the soil seed bank in 2,796 community plots from 54 datasets in managed grasslands, forests and intermediate, successional habitats across a climate gradient. Results Soil seed banks held more species than the herb layer, being compositionally similar across habitats. Species richness was lower in forests and successional habitats compared to grasslands, with annual temperature range more important than mean annual temperature for determining richness. Climate and land-use effects were generally less pronounced when plant community richness included seed bank species richness, while there was no clear effect of land use and climate on compositional similarity between the seed bank and the herb layer. Main conclusions High seed bank diversity and compositional similarity between the herb layer and seed bank plant communities may provide a potentially important functional buffer against the impact of ongoing environmental changes on plant communities. This capacity could, however, be threatened by climate warming. Dormant life-history stages can therefore be important sources of diversity in changing environments, potentially underpinning already observed time-lags in plant community responses to global change. However, as soil seed banks themselves appear, albeit less, vulnerable to the same changes, their potential to buffer change can only be temporary, and major community shifts may still be expected.",Article,"Plue, J.; Van Calster, H.; Auestad, I.; Basto, S.; Bekker, R.M.; Bruun, H.H.; Chevalier, R.; Decocq, G.; Grandin, U.; Hermy, M.; Jacquemyn, H.; Jakobsson, A.; Jankowska-Blaszczuk, M.; Kalamees, R.; Koch, M.A.; Marrs, R.H.; Marteinsdottir, B.; Milberg, P.; Maren, I.E.; Pakeman, R.J.; Phoenix, G.K.; Thompson, K.; Vandvik, V.; Wagner, M.; Auffret, A.G.",climate change; Europe; forest; grassland; land&#8208; use change; plant biodiversity; soil seed bank,climate change;Europe;forest;grassland;land&#8208;use change;plant biodiversity;soil seed bank;SPECIES RICHNESS;EXTINCTION RISK;DIVERSITY;SIMILARITY;MAINTENANCE;LONGEVITY;PATTERNS;MAINTAIN;SPACE;TIME,Sweden;Belgium;Norway;Colombia;Netherlands;Denmark;France;Poland;Estonia;Germany;United Kingdom;Iceland,2-s2.0-85093520518;2-s2.0-85093520518

While some studies have investigated their potential human effects, little is known about their mechanism of action in terms of the ecological diversity and evolutionary relationships among the group. In the current study we investigated the neuromuscular blockade of the venom of two sister species Micrurus mipartitus and Micrurus dissoleucus, which exhibit divergent ecological characteristics in Colombia, by using the chick biventer cervicis nerve-muscle preparation. We also undertook a phylogenetic analysis of these species and their congeners, in order to provide an evolutionary framework for the American coral snakes. The venom of M. mipartitus caused a concentration-dependant inhibition (3-10 mu g/ml) of nerve-mediated twitches and significantly inhibited contractile responses to exogenous ACh (1 mM), but not KCl (40 mM), indicating a postsynaptic mechanism of action. The inhibition of indirect twitches at the lower venom dose (3 mu g/ml) showed to be triphasic and the effect was further attenuated when PLA2 was inhibited. M. dissoleucus venom (10-50 mu g/ml) failed to produce a complete blockade of nerve-mediated twitches within a 3 h time period and significantly inhibited contractile responses to exogenous ACh (1 mM) and KCl (40 mM), indicating both postsynaptic and myotoxic mechanisms of action. Myotoxic activity was confirmed by morphological studies of the envenomed tissues. Our results demonstrate a hitherto unsuspected diversity of pharmacological actions in closely related species which exhibit divergent ecological characteristics; these results have important implications for both the clinical management of Coral snake envenomings and the design of Micrurus antivenom.

We evaluated edge effects on tropical cloud forest anurans in three landscapes with a different degree of anthropogenic disturbance, and their relationships with eight environmental variables. On each landscape we set up 12 permanent transects (two per habitat type: streams in pastures, pastures, the outer limit of the pastures with the forest, the internal edge of the forest, the forest interior and streams inside the forest) and surveyed them using an equal effort. After an effort of 162 man-hours we recorded a total of 251 anurans of eight species. Richness was higher in the forest (seven species) than in pasture (four species). Most species of the ensemble (75%) inhabited the forest habitats, whereas 50% of the anuran species inhabited the pasture. Slope and distance to streams influenced the distribution of all modeled Pristimantis species, although this genus exhibits direct development and doesn't require bodies of water for its reproduction. The canopy cover had a high explanatory power (through beta regressors) on the presence of anuran species in the microhabitat; whereas temperature and relative humidity did not, suggesting that temperature and relative humidity may be less important for frog distributions along pasture-forest gradients in cloud forest landscapes. The anthropogenic disturbance in the landscape, rather than the edge effects, affects the presence of two rare species (Pristimantis ptochus and Pristimantis kelephas) suggesting that these species display a high degree of sensitivity to the transformation of the cloud forest.

Our main findings include the following: ( 1) A. seniculus had the highest level of microsatellite variability while A. caraya and A. palliata had the lowest mean number of alleles per locus and the lowest expected heterozygosity, respectively; ( 2) the samples of A. seniculus and A. palliata came from different regions and were not in Hardy- Weinberg equilibrium ( HWE) which may indicate a Wahlund effect and differentiated gene pools - in contrast, A. macconnelli and A. caraya were in HWE; ( 3) the microsatellite genetic heterogeneity of the 4 Alouatta species was similar to the karyotype divergence found among these Alouatta species; the species pair with the lowest level of heterogeneity ( genetic differentiation) was A. seniculus/ A. caraya, while the Central American species, A. palliata, was highly differentiated from the other 3 South American species; ( 4) we recommend the establishment of a conservation plan to help protect A. caraya because the Cornuet and Luikart procedure demonstrated a recent bottleneck for this species.

HCV is classified in six major genotypes and more than 70 subtypes. In Colombian blood banks, serum samples were tested for anti-HCV antibodies using a third-generation ELISA. The aim of this study was to characterize the viral sequences in plasma of 184 volunteer blood donors who attended the ""Banco Nacional de Sangre de la Cruz Roja Colombiana,'' Bogota, Colombia. Three different HCV genomic regions were amplified by nested PCR. The first of these was a segment of 180 bp of the 5'UTR region to confirm the previous diagnosis by ELISA. From those that were positive to the 5'UTR region, two further segments were amplified for genotyping and subtyping by phylogenetic analysis: a segment of 380 bp from the NS5B region; and a segment of 391 bp from the E1 region. The distribution of HCV subtypes was: 1b (82.8%), 1a (5.7%), 2a (5.7%), 2b (2.8%), and 3a (2.8%). By applying Bayesian Markov chain Monte Carlo simulation, it was estimated that HCV-1b was introduced into Bogota around 1950. Also, this subtype spread at an exponential rate between about 1970 to about 1990, after which transmission of HCV was reduced by anti-HCV testing of this population. Among Colombian blood donors, HCV genotype 1b is the most frequent genotype, especially in large urban conglomerates such as Bogota, as is the case in other South American countries. J. Med.

The animals came from the borders of Guatemala and Belize, Costa Rica, and eight different departments of Colombia (Antioquia, Choco, Sucre, Bolivar, Cordoba, Magdalena, Cauca, and Valle del Cauca). Three different and significant haplotype lineages were found in Colombia living sympatrically in the same departments. They all presented high levels of gene diversity but the third Colombian gene pool was determined likely to be the most ancestral lineage. The second Colombian mitochondrial (mt) haplogroup is likely the source of origin of the unique Central America mt haplogroup that was detected. Our molecular population genetics data do not agree with the existence of two well-defined subspecies in Central America (limitaneus and imitator). This Central America mt haplogroup showed significantly less genetic diversity than the Colombian mt haplogroups. All the C. capucinus analyzed showed evidence of historical population expansions. The temporal splits among these four C. capucinus lineages were related to the completion of the Panamanian land bridge as well as to climatic changes during the Quaternary Period. Am. J.

Here we (a) test the CVH by assessing the effect of latitude and elevation on the thermal ranges of Andean vascular plant species and communities, and (b) assess tropical alpine plants vulnerability to warming based on their thermal traits. Location High tropical Andes. Taxon Vascular plants. Methods Temperature data for 505 vascular plant species from alpine communities on 49 summits, were extracted from 29,627 georeferenced occurrences. Species thermal niche traits (TNTs) were estimated using bootstrapping for: minimum temperature, optimum (mean) temperature and breadth (maximum-minimum). Plant community-weighted scores were estimated using the TNTs of their constituent species. CVH was tested for species, biogeographical species groups and communities. Vulnerability to global warming was assessed for species, biogeographical species groups and communities. Results Species restricted to the equator showed narrower thermal niche breadth than species whose ranges stretch far from the equator, however, no difference in niche breadth was found across summits' elevation. Biogeographical species groups distributed close to the equator and restricted to alpine regions showed narrower niche breadth than those with broader ranges. Community-weighted scores of thermal niche breadth were positively related to distance from equator but not to elevation. Based on their TNTs, species restricted to equatorial latitudes and plant communities dominated by these species were identified as the most vulnerable to the projected 1.5 degrees C warming, due to a potentially higher risk of losing thermal niche space. Main conclusions Our study confirms that the CVH applies to high tropical Andean plant species and communities, where latitude has a strong effect on the thermal niche breadth.

Here we propose and test the hypothesis that, as fragment area increases, species density (the number of species in a standardised plot) will scale with an exponent given by the difference between the exponents of the species-area relationships for islands (z similar to 0.25) and in contiguous habitat (z similar to 0.15), and test whether scaling varies between land uses. We also investigate the scaling of overall abundance and rarefaction-based richness, as some mechanisms make different predictions about how fragment area should affect them. The relevant data from the taxonomically and geographically broad PREDICTS database were used to model the three diversity measures, testing their scaling with fragment area and whether the scaling exponent varied among land uses (primary forest, secondary forest, plantation forest, cropland and pasture). In addition, the consistency of the response of species density to fragment area was tested across three well represented taxa (Magnoliopsida, Hymenoptera and herptiles'). Species density and total abundance showed area-scaling exponents of 0.07 and 0.16, respectively, and these exponents did not vary significantly among land uses; rarefaction-based richness by contrast did not increase consistently with area. These results suggest that the area-scaling of species density is driven by the area-scaling of total abundance, with additive edge effects (species moving into the small fragments from the surroundings) opposing - but not fully overcoming - the effect of fragment area on overall density of individuals. The interaction between fragment area and higher taxon (plants, vertebrates and invertebrates), which remained in the rarefied richness model, indicates that mechanisms may vary among groups.",Article,"Phillips, H.R.P.; Halley, J.M.; Urbina-Cardona, J.N.; Purvis, A.",,PLANT-SPECIES RICHNESS;HABITAT FRAGMENTATION;FOREST FRAGMENTS;EXTINCTION DEBT;LAND-USE;TERRESTRIAL BIODIVERSITY;ISLAND BIOGEOGRAPHY;LANDSCAPE;DIVERSITY;RESPONSES,United Kingdom;Germany;Greece;Colombia,2-s2.0-85037337583

Although many studies have contributed to what we know about the phylogenetics of Aotus, none used a sufficiently large number of samples to clarify its complexity. To address this need, we sequenced 696 base pairs of the mitochondrial cytochrome-oxidase II gene (mtCOII) in 69 specimens of 7 taxa of Aotus. We also analyzed 8 microsatellite loci in 136 individuals of 6 taxa. In contrast to previous studies, we sampled only wild individuals and have a precise geographical origin for each one. The mtDNA results showed that: 1) the northern gray-necked group of Aotus is genetically more homogeneous than the polyphyletic red-necked group of Aotus; 2) the ancestors of Aotus vociferans seem to be the original species candidate for the current Aotus; 3) Aotus azarae azarae and A. a. boliviensis are the most differentiated taxa, likely a result of extreme genetic drift during stasipatric speciation; 4) the first genetic splits found among taxa of Aotus occurred during the Pliocene (or even Miocene) while the most recent ones happened during the Pleistocene, when forest refugia may have played an important role in speciation. The mean number of microsatellite alleles was 3-5.33 alleles per locus. We found some private alleles that could be useful in helping to identify illegal trade, although a larger sample size is needed to ensure that these alleles are really private to the relevant taxa.

However, during the winter and migration seasons, cities and surrounding fragmented areas could provide habitat for a variety of migrating birds. Unfortunately, much of the information on the occurrence of migrant species in cities has been concentrated in United States/Canada and little is known about the role of Neotropical cities. We performed a systematic review of the occurrence of forest Neotropical Migrant Bird Species (NMB) in small forest fragments and residential areas with urban tree canopy in Latin American countries during fall/spring migration and winter. We identified a total of 58 forest NMB from 19 studies, including 45 Nearctic Migrants and 12 Austral Migrants, and 54 NMB were found in small urban/rural fragments (0.5-19.6 ha) and 30 were found in residential areas. In addition, six NMB considered as interior-forest specialists during the breeding season in United States/Canada were found using small forest fragments or residential areas during fall/spring migration and winter. This suggests that for some interior-forest specialists, breeding in large forested areas does not preclude their use of fragmented areas as stopover and wintering sites.

In particular, frugivorous bats are important for regeneration processes in open and degraded areas, because they disperse the seeds of pioneer plant species, which are essential for succession. Depending on the type of habitat that is established at the fragment edge, resources and bat movement patterns toward open areas can be affected. The structure and composition of bats was compared between two 'interior-edge-pasture' gradients, in an Andean forest fragment located at the Reserva Natural la Montaa del Ocaso (Quindio, Colombia). The two edge-types considered were forest-edge and bamboo-edge (Guadua angustifolia, Poaceae), both located in the same fragment. Bat abundance was significantly different in the two edge habitats. The forest-edge is a soft edge, in that it allows bat species to move from the interior of the forest to the pasture in front of it. In contrast, the bamboo-edge can be defined as semi-permeable, because it allows less movement of species and individuals from the interior to the pasture.

Did the Neotropics accumulate species steadily throughout their long history, or attain their remarkable diversity recently? Biologists have long debated the relative support for these museum and cradle hypotheses, but few phylogenies of megadiverse tropical clades have included sufficient taxa to distinguish between them. We used 1288 ultraconserved element loci spanning 293 species, 211 genera, and 21 families of characoid fishes to reconstruct a new, fossil-calibrated phylogeny and infer the most likely diversification scenario for a clade that includes a third of Neotropical fish diversity. This phylogeny implies paraphyly of the traditional delimitation of Characiformes because it resolves the largely Neotropical Characoidei as the sister lineage of Siluriformes (catfishes), rather than the African Citharinodei. Time-calibrated phylogenies indicate an ancient origin of major characoid lineages and reveal a much more recent emergence of most characoid species. Diversification rate analyses infer increased speciation and decreased extinction rates during the Oligocene at around 30 Ma during a period of mega-wetland formation in the proto-Orinoco-Amazonas. Three species-rich and ecomorphologically diverse lineages (Anostomidae, Serrasalmidae, and Characidae) that originated more than 60 Ma in the Paleocene experienced particularly notable bursts of Oligocene diversification and now account collectively for 68% of the approximately 2150 species of Characoidei. In addition to paleogeographic changes, we discuss potential accelerants of diversification in these three lineages.

Several conservation planning studies have used threatened freshwater fishes or species that are vulnerable to climate change as conservation targets, but none has included both in priority-setting analysis. The objectives of this study were to identify gaps in the coverage of the existing protected areas in representing the endemic freshwater fishes of the Tropical Andes region, and to identify conservation priority areas that adequately cover threatened species and species vulnerable to climate change. Data on 648 freshwater fishes from the Tropical Andes were used to identify gaps in the protected area coverage, and to identify conservation priority sites under three scenarios: (i) prioritize threatened species; (ii) prioritize species that are vulnerable to climate change; and (iii) prioritize both threatened species and species vulnerable to climate change. A total of 571 species (88% of all species) were not covered by any protected areas; most of them are restricted to <= 10 catchments. To represent both threatened species and species vulnerable to climate change in the third scenario, 635 catchments were identified as priority areas, representing 26.5% of the study area. The number of irreplaceable catchments for this scenario is 475, corresponding to 22.5% of the total area.

Here, we estimate the effect of diet diversification on speciation rates in noctilionoid bats, controlling for tree shape, rate heterogeneity and macroevolutionary regimes. We hypothesise that niche subdivision among herbivores positively relates to speciation rates, differing between macroevolutionary regimes. We found the rate at which new herbivorous lineages originate decreases as rates of diet evolution increase. Herbivores experience higher speciation rates, but generalist herbivores and predominantly herbivorous omnivores speciate faster than specialised herbivores, omnivores and animalivores. Generalised herbivory is not a dead end.

The most important risk factors for these malignancies include immune dysfunction, chronic immune activation, and loss of T-cell receptor (TCR) repertoire. The combination of all these factors can favor the reactivation of EBV, malignant cell transformation, and clinical progression toward B-cell lymphomas. The overarching aim of this study was to evaluate the frequency, phenotype, functionality, and distribution of TCR clonotypes for EBV-specific T-cell subpopulations in HIV+ patients at different clinical stages and for HIV+ patients with B-cell lymphoma, as well as to establish their association with clinical variables of prognostic value. Factors were studied in 56 HIV+ patients at different clinical stages and in six HIV+ subjects with diagnosed B-cell lymphoma. We found a significant decrease in all subpopulations of EBV-specific CD4(+) T cells from HIV+ patients at stage 3 and with B-cell lymphoma. EBV-specific effector CD8(+) T cells, particularly effector memory cells, were also reduced in HIV+ patients with B-cell lymphoma. Interestingly, these cells were unable to produce IFN-gamma and lacked multifunctionality in HIV+ patients. The TCR-V beta repertoire, which is key for protection against EBV in healthy individuals, was less diverse in HIV+ patients due to a lower frequency of TCR-V beta(2+), V beta 4(+), V beta 7.1(+), V beta 9(+), V beta 13.6(+), V beta 14(+), V beta 17(+), V beta 22(+) CD4(+), V beta 14(+), and V beta 17(+) CD8(+) T cells. HIV+ patients with positive plasma EBV loads (EBV+HIV+) had a noteworthy decrease in the levels of both TNF-alpha(+) and multifunctional TNF-alpha(+)/IL-2(+) and TNF-alpha(+)/IFN-gamma(+)CD8(+) T cells.

Their generalist habits have allowed them to be present in a large number of urban parks, which are the habitat for wild mammal species, some of these animals are restricted to these areas. Moreover, dogs can perform activities alone or in a group during day and night time, having a wide temporal niche. However, the issues related to activity patterns overlap and temporal niche breadth between dogs and wild mammals in urban parks are still poorly known and have not been studied in deep. In this investigation, we evaluated the activity patterns, the temporal niche breadth, and the activity patterns overlap between medium-sized wild mammals (MSWM) and dogs using trap cameras in five urban parks in Xalapa, Veracruz. Mexico. During March to August 2014, there were taken 928 photo-captures of MSWM and dogs (720 trap nights). The activity patterns of MSWM were bimodal (two activity peaks), being more active during night time. MSWM showed low temporal niche breadth versus dogs. Five species of MSWM overlap their activity patterns with dogs in five urban parks. Didelphis marsupialis and Urocyon cinereoargenteus were the species with the greatest overlap regarding dogs, finding some individuals of this species lifeless in the studied sites.

The obtained yield of 1.7 mu g of DNA/g of soil was used to construct a metagenomic library of approximately 20,000 clones (in the plasmid p-Bluescript II SK+) with an average insert size of 4 Kb, covering 80 Mb of the total metagenomic DNA. Metagenomic sequences near the plasmid cloning site were sequenced and them trimmed and assembled, obtaining 299 reads and 31 contigs (0.3 Mb). Taxonomic assignment of total sequences was performed by BLASTX, resulting in 68.8, 44.8 and 24.5% classification into taxonomic groups using the metagenomic RAST server v2.0, WebCARMA v1.0 online system and MetaGenome Analyzer v3.8 software, respectively. Most clone sequences were classified as Bacteria belonging to phlya Actinobacteria, Proteobacteria and Acidobacteria. Among the most represented orders were Actinomycetales (34% average), Rhizobiales, Burkholderiales and Myxococcales and with a greater number of sequences in the genus Mycobacterium (7% average), Frankia, Streptomyces and Bradyrhizobium. The vast majority of sequences were associated with the metabolism of carbohydrates, proteins, lipids and catalytic functions, such as phosphatases, glycosyltransferases, dehydrogenases, methyltransferases, dehydratases and epoxide hydrolases.

Five different Andean Bolivian pumas were detected and together with three skins of animals hunted completed eight Andean Bolivian pumas studied here. Additionally, 45 DNA samples from wild pumas from Colombia, Peru, Ecuador, Venezuela and western Brazilian Amazon were analyzed by means of hair with roots, little pieces of skins, Muscle tissues and teeth. All these 53 Puma DNA were genotypified for seven microsatellites (Fca 08, 24, 43, 45, 96, 126 and 39 1). The levels of gene diversity were very high in both sample groups (H 0.942 and 0.845, respectively), with values considerably higher than those found in the North American pumas. Diverse population assignment analyses showed that the Bolivian Andean pumas did not form a different significant cluster from the other puma group studied. Only Fca 96 showed significant heterogeneity between both groups. Nevertheless, globally, this heterogeneity was very small (F-ST, G(ST), R-ST). On the contrary, the gene flow estimates between both groups were very elevated for all the procedures performed. The estimation of the parameter theta (= 4N(e)mu), by means of the maximum likelihood procedure of Nielsen (1997), showed that the Bolivian sample is a similar extension of the puma population of the other Latin American Countries analyzed.

Frequently, these lands are abandoned leading to a mosaic of natural vegetation in secondary succession. Further degradation of the natural vegetation in these lands could be exacerbated by stochastic catastrophic events such as hurricanes. Information on the impact of human disturbance parallel to natural disturbance has not yet been evaluated for faunal assemblages in tropical dry forests. To evaluate the response of herpetofaunal assemblages to the interaction of human and natural disturbances, we used information of pre- and post-hurricane herpetofaunal assemblages inhabiting different successional stages (pasture, early forest, young forest, intermediate forest, and old growth forest) of dry forest. Herpetofaunal assemblages were surveyed in all successional stages two years before and two years after the hurricane Jova that hit the Pacific Coast of Mexico on October 2011. We registered 4093 individuals of 61 species. Overall, there were only slight effects of successional stage, hurricane Jova or the interaction between them on abundance, observed species richness and diversity of the herpetofauna. However, we found marked changes in estimated richness and composition of frogs, lizards, and snakes among successional stages in response to hurricane Jova. Modifications in vegetation structure as result of hurricane pass promoted particular changes in each successional stage and taxonomic group (anurans, lizards, and snakes).

Primates are one of more confiscated taxa by the environmental authorities in Bogota, Colombia. During 2008, 133 monkeys were confiscated; samples from 115 of them were sequenced by the mitochondrial cythocrome oxidase II gene (mtCOII) and 112 sequences obtained were of high quality. These sequences were compared with those obtained by our research group from individuals directly sampled in the field, with precise geographic origin. So, a more specific geographic area of the Colombian territory could be considered for a correct rehabilitation treatment during the reintroduction of these confiscated animals. The main results with five primate species were: 1- For all the specimens analyzed of Saguinus copus, they could be liberated in any geographical area of its distribution range, since only one gene pool was found. 2- For the 14 Aorta sp. individuals sequenced from the SDA (Environmental District Secretariat), one of them (A. vociferans) was coming from the Amazon, seven exemplars belonged to A. griseimembra from the Magdalena Valley and the Colombian Caribbean coasts, four individuals represented to A. brumbacki from the Colombian Eastern Llanos, and two were associated to A. azarae azarae from Northern Argentina and Paraguay (which means that illegal traffic of animals is arriving to Colombia from other South-American countries). 3-Out 14 Cebus albifrons sequenced, two belonged to the geographical area of C. a. versicolor, one to C. a. pleei, 10 to C. a. leucocephalus and one could be not assigned because its sequence yielded a great genetic divergence with respect to the other specimens sequenced of this species. 4- The two Cebus capucinus sequenced showed to be associated to a gene pool found in the Northern of Choco, Sucre and Cordoba Departments. 5- Out 11 Cebus apella sequenced, 10 showed to belong to the gene pool presented in the Colombian Eastern Llanos and highly related (but differentiable) to Cebus apella open from the French Guyana.

We registered 119 snakes belonging to 33 species. Traffic levels significantly influenced rates of snake road kill, while adjacent vegetation cover, rainfall seasonality, and landscape structure and composition did not. We classified the species into seven ecological groups based upon foraging strategy, body length, and habitat preferences. Although most of the road-killed species had an active foraging strategy, all of the ecological groups contained some species that were killed on the highway, as well as some species that inhabited adjacent vegetation cover but that were not detected on the highway. The different ecological groups were not associated with different landscape characteristics. Six of the 13 landscapes that presented the lowest species richness of road-killed species had a different ecological group represented by each of the species documented as road kills. Thus, considering the ecological group that a species belongs to provides a complementary analytical approach that permits a fuller understanding of the ecological effects of roads on the functional role of the species in the ecosystem.

In this study, we focused on type and quantity of seeds dispersed by a population of Oilbirds in Cueva de Los Guacharos National Park (Colombia). We assessed temporal variation in diet composition, fruit nutrient composition and measured seed morphology. To do this, we used 5-10 seed traps in a cave from 2011 to 2016, conducting a 5-day census 1-4 times each year. In 2015, we performed a census in all 12 months to document within year variation. We found seeds of 52 species (including 17 named species, 12 identified just to family, and 23 morphospecies). We found a clear dominance of Arecaceae and Lauraceae families. Intra-annual variation in species richness reflects the fact that more biomass and higher seed numbers are deposited in the cave in periods of nesting (January-June), as well as during seasonal fruiting patterns in the region. Data on fruit contents from published literature indicated that oilbird diet includes a high representation of lipid-rich fruits. Consumed seed size varied enormously (range: 0.01-5.99 g dry mass), the largest seeds being up to 29 mm wide and 54 mm long.

This study described the dietary habits of chironomid genera, identified whether the dietary habits were specialized or generalist, and analyzed the diet overlap in the genera. Chironomidae larvae were collected from four lakes of the Chingaza paramo during the dry season, between April and May of 2 016. The feeding habits of larvae were evaluated by analyzing gut contents following standard methods. Each genus was assigned to trophic guilds (carnivore, detritivore and algivore) and the diet overlap was estimated using the Pianka's index. A total of 1 003 individuals were collected and nine genera were identified. Larvae consumed mainly fine particulate organic matter (FPOM), algae, macrophyte fragments, macroinvertebrates, and animal tissues. FPOM was the main feeding resource of detritivores. The analysis of diets showed a high affinity of each genus for a single trophic guild and most of the genera were generalist in the use of resources.

However, environmental heterogeneity and dispersal limitation may be antagonistic forces to homogenization, maintaining inherent floristic differentiation across sites. We evaluated the extent to which peri-urban Andean forests are undergoing floristic homogenization in both late- and early-successional stands. We considered seedling assemblages as well, as they provide key insights into forests' future. We then quantified the relative importance of dispersal limitation and environmental filtering in determining the observed patterns of floristic similarity across the landscape. We used tree, seedling, soil and climatic data from six sites located in the high plain where Bogota lies (Colombia). Within each site, we established six 20 x 20 m plots, three in early-successional stands and three in late-successional stands, for a total of 36 plots. To evaluate the extent of floristic homogenization, we defined tree floristic similarity among late-successional stands as a baseline, reflecting our best-guess of the original species composition that would have once occurred previous to intense anthropogenic intervention. Tree floristic turnover across the landscape was alike in late- and in early-secondary stands, a finding that does not support the homogenization scenario. Seedling species composition, in contrast, was more homogeneous among early- than among late-secondary stands, an outcome suggestive of homogenization. The relative importance of spatial and environmental drivers shifted between life stages. Distance between plots was the best predictor of tree species dissimilarity (29% of variance explained), whereas seedling compositional variation was more sensitive to changes in environmental conditions (41% of the variance explained). Relative humidity and several variables related to soil fertility showed a significant effect on floristic dissimilarity across the landscape, although significant factors were often different between life stages.

In an inter-Andean dry tropical forest of the upper Magdalena valley (Huila, Colombia), secondary successional patterns were identified through cluster analysis and nonmetric multidimensional scaling, for 171 plots of grasslands, shrubs, and forests grouped by age of abandonment. Seven floristic groups showing differences in structural and composition attributes, were clearly defined in the multivariate analysis. The total number of individuals, species richness and basal area increased with the age of abandonment. Exclusive floristic groups were identified for each age class as well as some floristic groups that are shared throughout the succession. Four successional trajectories are proposed: two in areas with lower rainfall ranging from grasslands to shrubland, and forest with low values of floristic richness and less structural complexity; the other two in sectors with higher precipitation, ranging from grasslands to shrubs and forests with greater structural complexity and richness.

For this purpose, Varadero Reef near Cartagena, Colombia, serves as an informative study system located at the entrance of the Bay of Cartagena adjacent to the Canal del Dique, which carries turbid and polluted water into the bay. Varadero's survival under poor environmental conditions makes it a great study site for investigating the relationship between the microbiome and coral resistance to environmental stressors. To determine whether the microbiomes of Varadero corals differ from those in less impacted sites, we conducted a reciprocal transplant experiment by relocating coral fragments from Varadero as well as a geographically proximate reef that is less affected by plume dynamics (Rosario) across a gradient of turbidity (low, medium, and high). After 6 months of acclimatization, transplanted corals developed site-specific microbiomes that differed significantly from pre-transplant microbiomes, and corals transplanted to the highly impacted site from both Varadero and Rosario site saw higher mortality and an increase in overall microbial diversity. In combination with physiology and survivorship outcomes pointing to a limit in the corals' photoacclimative capacity, our results indicate that, rather than surviving, Varadero Reef is experiencing a slow decline, and its corals are likely on the brink of dysbiosis.

In each landscape, the strategy was the same: convene diverse partners, identify biological and sociocultural assets, document residents' use of natural resources, and tailor the findings to the needs of decision-makers.

In this paper, we describe the richness and composition of species and varieties of plants used for food in home gardens of the municipality of San Pablo in the Middle Magdalena Basin of Colombia, and discuss its possible relations with a set of socio-economic and structural variables. A survey was conducted in 20 home gardens where semi structured questionnaires were administered to the head of each household, and all plants used as food were recorded. The physical characteristics of the home gardens varied widely. Farmers' ages varied between 28-90 years and the most frequent level of schooling was primary education. In total, 75 species represented by 162 varieties were found. Plantains (Musa x paradisiaca), mangos (Mangifera indica), guavas (Psidium guajava) and cassavas (Manihot esculenta) were the most diverse and frequent crops across gardens. The mean number of species per home garden was 17.5 (SD = 7.1), ranging from 6 to 33. On average 48% of the species recorded were fruits, followed by spices (17%), roots and tubers (12%) and vegetables (9%). Significant correlations were found between food plant richness and farmers' ages (r(s) = 0.461, p = 0.04) and food plant richness and number of family members (r(s) = -0.487, p = 0.03).

Currently, more than half of the Earth's surface is used for the establishment of production systems; in this context, live fences can generate positive effects on the environment and provide environmental goods and services. In this work, we reviewed the effects of live fences on production systems from the tropical regions of America, Africa, Asia and Australia, analyzing the uses and perceptions of farmers that have made use of these fences. It was found that live fences were mainly related to the delimitation of farms and pastures. However, their uses and benefits are manifold, among which we found: provide forage, wood extraction, fruit supply, windbreaks, medicinal, to avoid soil erosion, moisture retention and nutritional support. In addition, other positive perceptions were: increasing landscape connectivity, increasing economic incomes, reducing production costs, reducing pressure on remaining vegetation, keeping maintenance costs down, contributing to pest control, and improving fertility. However, negative perceptions included the excessive work in repairing or pruning them, shade negative impact on agricultural production, lack of information discourages establishment, high establishment costs, generation of property conflicts and management difficulty. It was found that the uses by farmers are focused on improving the yields of productive systems, but also on the conservation of natural resources especially soil and biodiversity. We proposed research topics for the future, as determining the criteria in the selection of native species to establish and enrich living fences valuing ecological and socioeconomic aspects; in additionally, we must deepen the benefits they produce on the yields of productive systems. We suggest the development of live fences studies in the tropical region of Australasia, because no data was found for this region, in order to know the biodiversity and services status that they provide to the rural communities. As a conclusion, it will be important to generate initiatives that encourage the formulation of rural policies, the creation of programs that encourage the establishment of live fences, whether through payments for environmental services, tax compensation or other mechanisms.

We also genotyped 3 DNA microsatellites from 78 white-lipped peccaries representing the 4 putative morphological subspecies (i.e., spiradens, aequatoris, pecari, and albirostris) present in northwestern South America (i.e., Colombia, Ecuador, Peru, and Bolivia). Our results showed: 1) the estimated diversity of the mtDNA control region in the T. pecari population was extremely high, whereas the average genetic diversity for the microsatellites was medium to high and similar to that observed in European pig breeds; 2) there was no significant genetic heterogeneity among the quoted putative morphological subspecies at the mitochondrial marker, but we did detect significant (although relatively small) genetic heterogeneity using microsatellites, indicating that T. pecari albirostris is a uniquely differentiated group; and 3) the phylogenetic mtDNA trees showed that haplotypes were intermixed independent of their ""a priori"" subspecies classification. In addition, the microsatellite assignation analyses yielded low percentages of well-classified individuals when the analysis considered the geographic morphology of the subspecies. Thus, the molecular results do not support the putative morphological subspecies of T. pecari in northwestern South America.

These analyses must be performed with special care because of the low DNA concentrations and contamination risk; therefore, it is necessary to establish protocols to guarantee the reproducibility and veracity of results. Objective: The present study aims to establish a protocol to obtain ancient DNA from 16 pre-Columbian bone samples found in an excavation performed in the area ""Candelaria La Nueva"" in Bogota, Colombia, dated in the period ""Muisca Tardio"". Methods: Four founder mitochondrial DNA Amerindian haplotypes were analyzed by high resolution restriction enzyme analyses, obtaining fragments between 121 and 186 base pairs (bp). Different analyses were performed following a strict control of authenticity criteria regarding laboratory conditions, including: positive and negative controls, reproducibility of results, and verification of particular characteristics present in ancient DNA. Results: Results obtained from the bone samples showed the exclusive presence of haplogroup A in the population studied. This data support the statement of the archaeologists of a single biological population in space and time. The distribution of this haplogroup in a 100% frequency supports the hypothesis of Chibcha genetic affiliation. Conclusion: The present study is a contribution to the study of genetic diversity in archaic American populations, allowing the integration of geographic and historic data with genetic characterization techniques associated with linguistic, ethnographic, and glottochronology patterns. Following the protocol proposed in the present study allows fulfilling authenticity criteria for ancient samples with the available techniques.

DNA from eightyfive Helicobacter pylori-cagA positive strains were analyzed. Strains were obtained from patients diagnosed with functional dyspepsia at Clinica Fundadores in Bogota. The 3' region of the cagA gene was amplified through conventional Polymerase Chain Reaction (PCR). Obtained amplicons were sequenced using the Sanger method and analyzed with bioinformatics tools. Additionally, a significant Spearman correlation coefficient was determined between the patients' age and the number of EPIYA-C repeats; with p values < 0.05 considered significant. Estimates were obtained using a 95% CI. The 3 ' variable region of the cagA gene was amplified and PCR products of the following sizes corresponded to the following EPIYA motifs: 400 bp: EPIYA AB, 500 bp: EPIYA ABC, 600 bp: EPIYA ABCC and 700 bp: ABCCC. A single PCR band was observed for 58 out of 85 Helicobacter pylori isolates, with an EPIYA distribution motif as follows: 7/85 AB (8.2%), 34/85 ABC (40%), 26/85 ABCC (30.6%) and 18/85 ABCCC (21.2%). However, in 27 out of 85 Helicobacter pylori isolates, two or more bands were observed, where the most predominant cagA genotype were ABC-ABCC (26%, 7/27) and ABCC-ABCCC (22.2%, 6/27). A direct proportionality between the number of EPIYA-C repeats and an increase in the patients' age was observed, finding a greater number of EPIYA ABCC and ABCCC repeats in the population over 50 years old. All isolates were of the Western cagA type and 51.8% of them were found to have multiple EPIYA-C repeats.

The conservation status of Colombian TDFs is critical; currently, these forests only occupy eight percent of their original cover. Evidence shows that TDFs have a low probability of natural regeneration and may require ecological restoration. Seeds are central to the existence, permanence, and dynamics of plant communities in forests. Seeds exhibit a varied set of traits that exerts control on plant communities by limiting or facilitating plant establishment. According to previous research, in TDFs, most seeds are small, dry, and wind-dispersed, with a high drought tolerance (orthodox storage behavior). In this study, available information on the fruits and seeds of tree species distributed in Colombian TDFs was synthesized. Twelve Colombia TDFs datasets were selected, which included species' individual occurrences and diameters at breast height. For each TDF, the most important species were selected, and the literature was searched for their seed storage behaviors, dispersal syndromes, and general fruit and seed attributes. In contrast to initial expectations, the search results suggested that the most common dispersal syndrome of the most important species was animal dispersal, followed by wind dispersal. Thirty-nine species were found that were not currently naturally established and should be introduced by active restoration. Most of these species had capsule and drupe fruits. The most common dispersal syndrome was animal dispersal, and the most common seed storage behavior was orthodox. Dominance of animal-dispersed species exacerbates fragmentation and habitat loss in TDFs, making available niches difficult to colonize and reducing the ability of seeds to reach degraded sites. Orthodox germination of seeds can facilitate seed storage in ex situ germoplasm banks to overcome low seed availability and/or forest soil seed bank.",Review,"Galindo-Rodriguez, C.; Roa-Fuentes, L.L.",Late successional forest; Late successional species; Orthodox seeds; Seed bank,Late successional forest;Late successional species;Orthodox seeds;Seed bank;DIVERSITY,Colombia,2-s2.0-85028910552;2-s2.0-85028910552

For these analyses, we subdivide the region into basin-wide assemblages encompassing the headwaters of four Amazonian tributaries (Urubamba, Yurua, Purus and Las Piedras basins), and habitat types: river channels, terra firme (nonfloodplain) streams, and floodplain lakes. We present a robust, well-documented collection of fishes from the region including 272 species collected from 132 field sites over 63 field days and four years, comprising the most extensive collection of fishes from this region to date. We conduct a preliminary community phylogenetic analysis based on this collection and recover results largely statistically indistinguishable from the random expectation, with only a few instances of phylogenetic structure.

The combined effects of cumulative natural and human disturbances on vertebrates have been little studied. There is evidence that herpetofaunal assemblages are sensitive in species richness, abundance, and diversity to anthropogenic and natural disturbances, or to their interaction. In the Pacific coast of Jalisco, Mexico, we aimed to evaluate the cumulative effects of hurricanes Jova (2011) and Patricia (2015) on herpetofaunal assemblages along tropical dry forest successional stages by comparing before and after the hurricanes. We conducted a long-term survey (2009 to 2018) on anuran, lizard and snake populations within five dry forest successional stages (from 0 to > 50 years after forest clearance), including the following: active pastures, early forests, young forests, intermediate forests, and old-growth forests as experimental controls. We hypothesized that cumulative effects of hurricanes will result in a general pattern of a decrease in abundance, richness and diversity, and an increase in evenness of anurans, lizards and snakes. We also expected that herpetofaunal diversity will decrease and evenness will increase in those stages with higher vegetation complexity, such as old-growth forest (OGF), and an increase in similarity and evenness in herpetofaunal assemblages in all successional stages. Overall, the abundance of anurans, lizards and snakes significantly decreased after hurricanes, but only for lizards and anurans the interaction of successional stage-hurricane was significant. Furthermore, species richness and diversity increased for lizards and decreased for snakes after hurricanes landed. Although, the pattern of anuran species richness among successional stages was similar after hurricanes, the richness in OGF markedly diminished after hurricanes. Interestingly our results showed that tropical dry secondary forests, under the impact of low intensity hurricanes, might function as buffers that promote herpetofauna resilience. However, cumulative effects of hurricanes resulted in a homogenization tendency among successional stages, suggesting a negative effect for ecosystem functioning. The changes in the buffering role of secondary forests highlights the importance of these ecosystems for conserving biodiversity in times when hurricane disturbances are increasing in frequency and intensity. Overall, we discuss how the complex interactions between human and natural disturbances such as hurricanes might be a factor that contributes to maintain biotic diversity in anthropic landscapes of tropical dry forests.",Article,"Marroquin-Paramo, J.A.; Suazo-Ortuno, I.; Urbina-Cardona, N.; Benitez-Malvido, J.",Tropical dry secondary forests; Human and natural disturbances; High-intensity hurricanes; Low-frequency of hurricanes,Tropical dry secondary forests;Human and natural disturbances;High-intensity hurricanes;Low-frequency of hurricanes;NONPARAMETRIC MULTIVARIATE ANALYSES;LUQUILLO EXPERIMENTAL FOREST;ESTIMATING POPULATION-SIZE;RAIN-FOREST;RECOVERY;COMMUNITIES;DISTURBANCE;RESILIENCE;SECONDARY;DIVERSITY,Mexico;Colombia,2-s2.0-85090601780;2-s2.0-85090601780

Studies addressing the identification of patterns and variations across several guilds are fundamental in ecomorphological research. Wings are the core of ecological morphology in bats; nevertheless, individual bones and structures that support the wing, including metacarpals, phalanges and the length of digits, have rarely been the subject of comprehensive research when studying wing morphology. Here, I analyzed morphological variations of wing structures across 11 bat guilds and how individual bone structures are correlated to diet, foraging mode and habitat use. I obtained wing measurements from 1512 voucher specimens of 97 species. All the specimens analyzed came from the Mammalian Collection at the Museo Javeriano de Historia Natural of Pontificia Universidad Javeriana (MPUJ-MAMM) (Bogota, Colombia). Positive correlations between size and the length of the third and fifth digit were detected. Bat guilds that capture their preys using aerial strategy in uncluttered habitats had longer third digits but short fifth digits compared to guilds that rely on gleaning strategy and forage in highly cluttered space. Although terminal phalanges were shown to be important structures for guild classification, metacarpals were strongly related to aerial foragers from uncluttered habitats because of their potential role in flight performance and ecological adaptations. Results show that habitat use, as well as foraging mode, are reflected in wing structures.

Among the xenarthrans, sloths constitute the most diverse paleontologically with almost 100 fossil genera recorded. However, this abundant sloth fauna in the Americas became extinct around 10,000 years ago. Only six species belonging to two genera,Bradypus(four three-toed sloth species) andCholoepus(two two-toed sloth species) are alive today in Central and South America.Bradypus variegatusis the sloth species with the widest geographical distribution in the Neotropics. Some regional population genetics have been reported, especially in Brazil, but with limited sample sizes. Herein, we sequenced 77 samples ofBradypys variegatus(Panama, Colombia, Venezuela, Peru, Bolivia, and Brazil; 65 new samples and 12 from GenBank), plus oneB. tridactylus, oneB. pygmaeus, and fiveB. torquatus(one new and four from GenBank) at the mitochondrial (mt) control region. Additionally, 25 of these samples, representing the four species, were sequenced for the entire mitochondrial genome. Our results indicate that there are at least six main genetically different haplogroups ofB. variegatus.They are the trans-Andean, western Amazon (with some other internal groups), Tapajos River, Tocantins River, Negro River, and the Brazilian eastern Atlantic forest (with two recognizable sub-groups in northern and southern areas) ones, with the ancestor of the trans-Andean haplogroup the first to diverge. A very strong genetic heterogeneity and a striking spatial pattern were detected among these different geographical areas, with the trans-Andean, western Amazon, and Tocantins populations showing the highest levels of genetic diversity, meanwhile the Tapajos and the Brazilian eastern populations yielding lower levels of genetic diversity. The following conclusions were as follows: 1)B. torquatusshould be considered as a different genus (Scaeopus) because of its extreme genetic differences from otherBradypustaxa as was previously claimed by other authors; 2)B. pygmaeusis not a recent species adapted to Holocene island environments from the Central AmericaB. variegatusgroup; and 3) if we adopt a strict version of the Phylogenetic Species Concept (PSC), the highly significant monophyletic clade of the trans-AndeanB. variegatuspopulation should be defined as a valid and differentiated species of three-toed sloth.

Crop landraces have unique local agroecological and societal functions and offer important genetic resources for plant breeding. Recognition of the value of landrace diversity and concern about its erosion on farms have led to sustained efforts to establish ex situ collections worldwide. The degree to which these efforts have succeeded in conserving landraces has not been comprehensively assessed. Here we modelled the potential distributions of eco-geographically distinguishable groups of landraces of 25 cereal, pulse and starchy root/tuber/fruit crops within their geographic regions of diversity. We then analysed the extent to which these landrace groups are represented in genebank collections, using geographic and ecological coverage metrics as a proxy for genetic diversity. We find that ex situ conservation of landrace groups is currently moderately comprehensive on average, with substantial variation among crops; a mean of 63% +/- 12.6% of distributions is currently represented in genebanks.

The knowledge of the Boyaci ecosystems and the high Andes are not an exception. Objective: this work provides information on diversity and structure of the Bijagual Massif, a high mountain area defined as a biological corridor, with paramo (2 900 - 3 460 mast) and high Andean forest (2 682 -3 268 mast) ecosystems. Methods: Sampling consisted of 27 random transacts in the high Andean forest (100 x 2.5 m) and 13 in the paramo (10 x 5 m). We recorded abundance data, growth form, height, coverage, DAP and basal area. We calculated diversity analyses (H', D and Jaccard), of vertical and horizontal structure. Results: Estimated species richness of 429 species in 86 families. Similarity does not exceed 46 % between sampling units, data that supports the heterogeneity of the Bijagual Massif. We recorded 10 777 individuals in the forest. The most abundant and richest growth forms were herbs (2 595/104) and trees (2 189/67), while lower in abundance and richness were vines (466/29). In the paramo 3 337 individuals, with a dominance of herbs (in frailejonal. shrubs and pajonal). rosettes (in frailejonal and pajonal) and shrubs. Species with ecological representativeness are: Clusia multillora. C. elliptica, C. alata, Weinmannia rollottii, Brunellia comocladifolia and Viburnum triphyllum. Conclusion: These results confirm the uniqueness of these high mountain ecosystems and the need to maintain the heterogeneity before the occurence of soil transformation processes. The last, is supported by the high species turnover among sampling units, the dominance per physiognomic type, and the ecological significance of arboreal and shrub species in the forest and those that reoccur in the paramo.

A decomposition experiment was set up, confining 10 g of litterfall in mesh bags. A total of 24 bags was set out, half of which contained naphthalene to avoid the entry of soil fauna. At two, four and 12 months, four bags of the treated litterfall and four of the control were collected. Each bag was placed in a Tullgren funnel to extract the associated soil fauna. This was identified to the lowest taxonomic level possible and classified into functional groups. Richness and diversity were calculated using Shannon and Simpson indices. Litterfall was dried and weighed in order to calculate percent decomposition. In the litterfall treatment there was a reduction in the abundance or absence of soil fauna during the first 60 days due to naphthalene, but there was no difference in percent decomposition between the treatment and control. There was a greater abundance of detritivores, followed by litter transformers and phytophages over the three sampling periods. Richness, dominance and equitability of functional groups were not different between the litterfall treatment and the control. This suggests that the role of soil fauna in the decomposition of litterfall is less relevant in this forest than lowland forests.",Article,"Varela, A.; Cortes, C.; Cotes, C.",arthropods; functional diversity; function; ecosystem process; Montane forest,arthropods;functional diversity;function;ecosystem process;Montane forest;NITROGEN MINERALIZATION;BIODIVERSITY;MICROARTHROPODS;DYNAMICS;SUCCESSION;DIVERSITY;PRODUCTIVITY;TEMPERATE;MOUNTAIN;SURFACE,Colombia,2-s2.0-79960541272

However, for many highly diverse countries, this information is not available. Here we present the methodology and the results of the three-part construction of a conservation planning database in Colombia: (1) the actual distribution of the ecosystems; (2) their original-potential distribution, which is important to calculate fixed targets for conservation; and (3) the chorological types, which are groups of spatial related ecosystems that account for biodiversity process that operate at larger scales. The procedure consists of integrating the results of the interpretation of satellite images, and the construction of ecological diagrams and biogeographical regions. The limits of the original-potential ecosystems in the transformed landscapes can either still be seen on the images or are reconstructed on the base of the information from the ecological diagrams. The chorological types are constructed by clustering of ecosystems on the base of the shared boundary length. The implementation for Colombia resulted in maps of 337 ecosystems and 63 chorological types.

With 39 described true parthenogens, scaled reptiles (Squamata) are the only vertebrates that evolved this reproductive strategy. Parthenogenesis is ecologically advantageous in the short term, but the young age and rarity of parthenogenetic species indicate it is less advantageous in the long term. This suggests parthenogenesis is self-destructive: it arises often but is lost due to increased extinction rates, high rates of reversal or both. However, this role of parthenogenesis as a self-destructive trait remains unknown. We used a phylogeny of Squamata (5388 species), tree metrics, null simulations and macroevolutionary scenarios of trait diversification to address the factors that best explain the rarity of parthenogenetic species. We show that parthenogenesis can be considered as self-destructive, with high extinction rates mainly responsible for its rarity in nature.

Among the hypotheses that explain resource use and diversity of insects are the Top-down and the Bottom-up hypotheses, in which experimental studies have shown trade-offs between these factors. The influence of parasitism, host plant and competition was evaluated to determine their effect on mortality of the seed beetle Stator limbatus from populations adapted to different host plants. Mortality of eggs caused by parasitism, and mortality of larvae caused by competition was recorded for seven populations that use a single host seed, and for one population that uses two hosts. Populations that use Acacia greggii experienced the lowest mortality, and populations that use Parkinsonia florida suffered the highest mortality, demonstrating no evidence of trade-offs between bottom-up and top-down factors. Interactions between host and larval density, and between host and number of eggs on seeds, showed variation between hosts in the mortality of beetles caused by competition and by parasitism, respectively. In addition, there was no evidence of egg size affecting parasitism of eggs.

Santiago of Chile is the single city belonging to the Mediterranean ecosystem in South America and is subject to extensive urbanization as seen throughout Latin America. We examined the role of 65 urban green spaces-6 large urban parks (PAR) and 59 small green spaces (SGS)-in harboring native birds during winter 2019, analyzing the quality of green areas in terms of vegetation (i.e. NDVI, native vegetation, and tree cover), exotic bird species, noise levels, and surrounding urban morphology (i.e. building height and cover). Significantly higher noise levels were detected in SGS, along with significantly greater exotic bird (n = 4) richness and abundance than PAR, which possessed significantly greater native bird (n = 25) richness and abundance. Native birds were more abundant than exotic birds in green spaces with average noise levels < 52 dB and average NDVI > 0.5. Occupancy models indicate that green space occupancy by 50% of modeled native bird species was influenced by maximum noise levels, playing a larger role than vegetation (30%) and urban morphology (0%).

Adequate understanding of the role of disturbances in tropical stand dynamics is necessary to guide management efforts. In this study, we used field data to characterize the effects of a major hurricane in broad-leaf and pine stands in Northern Nicaragua. First, we described tree and stand attributes associated with observed structural effects: branch loss, snapping and uprooting. Secondly, to assess the potential influence of hurricane Felix on stand composition, we characterized two key life-history traits: regeneration through resprouting and shade tolerance. Findings indicated that tree attributes such as diameter at breast height (dbh) and height to diameter ratio (hdr), were strongly associated with the type and magnitude of wind effects. All trees >70 cm dbh exhibited visible effects and trees taller than 14 m were more likely to be uprooted (7.3% vs. 0.8% of total). Results confirmed that Felix caused significant structural effects in broadleaf stands and mild effects in pine stands. Abundant post-hurricane resprouting was observed in both shade-tolerant and shade-intolerant species but was absent in pines. Among canopy trees we found eleven shade-intolerant species that exhibited abundant resprouting. These species could become dominant in the next decade.

This is a flagship and key umbrella species in Ecuador because its conservation has a positive impact on the conservation of many other species in the Andes. But to preserve, first one must know the genetic characteristics of a species, among other things. For this, we analyzed six mitochondrial genes and seven nuclear DNA microsatellites of 108 Andean bear specimens sampled throughout Ecuador. We adopted three strategies for analyzing the data: by Province, by Region (north vs south), and by Cordillera. Four main results were obtained. First, the mitochondrial genetic diversity levels were elevated, but there were no differences in genetic diversity by Province or by Cordillera. By Regions, southern Ecuador had higher genetic diversity levels than to northern Ecuador. The genetic diversity for the microsatellites was only medium for the Andean bear at this country. Second, there was clear and significant evidence of female population expansions, for the overall sample, by Province, Region, and Cordillera. This population expansion was determined to have occurred in the time interval of 30,000-20,000 years ago (YA), during the last phase of the Pleistocene. We detected a population decrease to have occurred more recently, within the last 5000 years. It continued until about 300-200 YA when a population increase was again detected. Third, there were, practically, no phylogeographic pattern nor genetic differentiation among Andean bear populations in Ecuador by Province or by Cordillera for either mitochondrial or microsatellite markers. There was a little more genetic differentiation between northern and southern areas. Fourth, there was no trace of significant spatial genetic structure for the Andean bear in Ecuador in agreement with the genetic differentiation analyses. This shows that the Andean Cordilleras in this country did not present an obstacle to the dispersion of this species.

Streams were selected according to their association with the main land's uses of the region in both basins. The aim of the study was to evaluate the effect of land use on the structure of macrophyte communities. Streams running exclusively through each land use were selected. Sampling was done in two different climatic seasons in 2006. Vegetation found (54 species belonging to 25 families) was dominated by species with high capability of adaptation to changing and disturbed environments. Richness and abundance of macrophytes were lower than those reported in other tropical aquatic systems. Variables associated with land use, such as temperature, conductivity and type of substrate of the streams mainly explained the structure of the macrophyte communities: streams running on meat-cattle areas -with higher temperatures, conductivity and dominance of sandy-slimy substrates- had higher macrophyte species richness and abundance than streams of protected-forest areas, with higher coverage of riparian vegetation, lower temperatures and conductivity and rocky substrates.",Article,"Gomez Rodriguez, A.M.; Valderrama Valderrama, L.T.; Rivera-Rondon, C.A.",aquatic plants; Colombia; habitats; land uses; mountain rivers; tropical rivers,aquatic plants;Colombia;habitats;land uses;mountain rivers;tropical rivers;AQUATIC MACROPHYTES;SPECIES RICHNESS;LOWLAND STREAMS;DIVERSITY;HABITAT;WATER;GRADIENT;DRIVERS;PLANTS,Colombia,

Assuming that all loci were in Hardy-Weinberg equilibrium, diversity statistics and analyses were performed. The average number of amplified fragments for each primer was 8.3, and the size of these fragments ranged from 350 to 3600 bp. The expected average heterozygosity was 0.358 +/- 0.103. The genetic heterogeneity among the populations studied was small (GST = 0.05 +/- 0.01); meanwhile, the gene flow estimates (N-m = 7.32 +/- 1.35) were high. In an identical way, the Nei's genetic distances obtained yielded very small values amongst the populations that were studied in this Colombian region. Furthermore, a spatial autocorrelation analysis with Moran's I index revealed a very weak, or inexistent, spatial genetic structure among these populations. The comparison of these results with those performed for other markers (isoenzymes and microsatellites) in populations of this same mosquito from the Colombian Atlantic coast was discussed.

(ex Sp. paucimobilis) 20006FA yielding the consortium called I-CON, in order to study ecological interactions into the bacterial community. DGGE and proteomic profiles and analyses by HTS (High-Throughput Sequencing) technologies demonstrated inoculant establishment and changes on CON composition. Inoculation increased degradation efficiency in I-CON and prevented intermediate HNA accumulation. This could be explained not only by the inoculation, but also by enrichment in Achromobacter genus at expense of a decrease in Klebsiella genus.

This paper provides density and abundance estimations of boto and tucuxi in 15 rivers sampled during the past nine years as part of a multinational research alliance. Visual boat-survey data collection protocols and analyses have been developed since 2012 (based on Distance Sampling methods) and recently reviewed (2019) to improve robustness and comparability. Differences across the sampled rivers and the analyzed river basins (Amazon and Orinoco) pointed to a density/population size gradient with lower densities and abundances observed in the Orinoco basin (0.9-1.5 ind./km(2)), passing through the eastern Amazon basin (2-5 ind./km(2)), and the largest numbers found at the central Brazilian Amazon (lower Purus River-2012 (14.5 boto/km(2), N = 7672; 17.1 tucuxi/km(2), N = 9238)). However, in other parts of the central Amazon, the density of dolphins was smaller than expected for high productive whitewater rivers (1-1.7 ind./km(2) in the Japura and Solimoes rivers).

For the first time, we studied the response of carabid beetles to vegetal succession and seasonality in this ecosystem in Colombia. Carabid beetles were collected from three TDF habitat types in two regions in Colombia: initial successional state (pasture), early succession, and intermediate succession (forest). The surveys were performed monthly for 13 months in one of the regions (Armero) and during two months, one in the dry and one in the wet season, in the other region (Cambao). A set of environmen-tal variables were recorded per month at each site. Twenty-four carabid beetle species were collected during the study. Calosoma alternans and Megacephala affinis were the most abundant species, while most species were of low abundance. Forest and pasture beetle assemblages were distinct, while the early succession assemblage overlapped with these assemblages. Canopy cover, litter depth, and soil and air temperatures were important in structuring the assemblages. Even though seasonality did not affect the carabid beetle assemblage, individual species responded positively to the wet season. It is shown that early successional areas in TDF could potentially act as habitat corridors for species to recolonize forest areas, since these successional areas host a number of species that inhabit forests and pastures.

These marine transgressions and regressions can generate isolation and connection among coastal rivers. In this region, freshwater fishes are excellent models for phylogeographic studies because their distributions may have been affected by geographical and ecological changes resulting from these processes. Therefore, the main objective of this study was to evaluate the effects of Pleistocene sea-level changes on the genetic structure of the loricariid Hisonotus leucofrenatus throughout its area of occurrence. Two genes were sequenced: Cytochrome Oxidase subunit 1 (mitochondrial gene) and rpS7 ribosomal protein gene intron 1 (nuclear gene) from specimens representing 14 river drainages. The genetic data corroborate a divide for freshwater fish by the Serra do Tabuleiro mountain in Santa Catarina State. This divide determines two main genetic groups in H. leucofrenatus: one group to the south and one to the north of this mountain range.

Research on their potential effects on native Neotropical bird communities has focused on taxonomic diversity, while its impacts on other ecological aspects remain only partially explored. We used camera traps to compare habitat use and activity patterns of an understory bird assemblage between a native forest and an adjacent eucalypt plantation in the Colombian Andes. Six and seven understory bird species comprised the eucalypt plantation and the native forest assemblages, respectively. Habitat use of the White-throated Quail-Dove (Zentrigon frenata), Sickle-winged Guan (Chamaepetes goudotii), and antpittas was significantly lower in the plantation, whereas brushfinches used both forest types equally. Each species showed coefficients of activity that overlapped above 59%, suggesting the overall activity patterns of the understory birds were similar in both forest types. However, activity peaks of most species were slightly different between the 2 forests. Despite the fact that these areas are adjacent to one another, and that this eucalypt plantation has undergone 50 years of understory growth, our results indicate that this exotic plantation does not constitute a suitable habitat for most Andean understory birds.

Multivariate statistical analyses were made to determine the relationships between environmental and biological data, specifically which environmental variables explain the diatom distribution. For each of these significant environmental variables, optima and ecological tolerances were calculated using the weighted-average method, which allowed for the classification of the species according to their environmental preferences. The lakes showed a wide range of environmental gradients in variables such as pH, alkalinity, and nutrients. In addition, the depth of the lakes was a direct determinant of the light environment of the water column. A total of 339 diatom taxa were identified belonging mainly to the genera Eunotia and Pinnularia. Variables related to pH-alkalinity gradient, trophic condition (nitrates and phosphorus), and physical factors (radiation at the bottom) had a significant effect on diatom composition.

However, it is unclear how other community properties influence evenness after integrating the effect of environmental gradients. Using 49 neotropical bat communities, we tested the hypothesis that evenness increases in communities that have low species richness and low biomass because the negative effect of richness and biomass on evenness is regulated by environmental seasonality. We selected among path models to determine how temperature seasonality, the most important gradient across study sites, affected richness and biomass as drivers of evenness. Employing three indices of evenness, we found that more seasonal climate reduces species richness, and lower richness increases evenness. Moreover, a decline in biomass with increasing seasonality also increases evenness. A decrease in resource specialization and rarity as sites become more seasonal may explain the negative relationship between seasonality, richness and evenness. Moreover, the negative effect of biomass on richness and evenness may be due to an expansion of niche space and a positive effect of smaller body size on diversification rates, which may allow more species packing and greater richness.

This change alters species occurrence probability, consequently impacting species' composition. For some species, the occurence probability increases with land-use changes, while it stays unchanged or decreases for others. This interspecific variation in the response to land-use change may be mediated by functional traits, among other factors. We investigated response functional traits to land-use changes and their influence on the occurrence probability of bird species in the Colombian Orinoquia region. We compiled data for 13 morphological and life-history traits of 364 species recorded in forests, savannas, rice fields, palm oil crops, and livestock pastures in the piedmont and flooded savanna landscapes. We used a novel framework to identify response functional traits (i.e., traits with a significant effect on occurrence probability) through multiple statistical tests. We used random forest models to identify response functional traits to land-use change for pairwise comparisons of natural vs. agricultural land use types. For the functional traits, we estimated the influence of their states as trait attributes on species' responses to land-use changes. We identified functional groups based on hierarchical clustering analysis. Functional groups corresponded to different levels of response, that is, different changes in probability occurrence. Land-use changes altered the multidimensional space of bird traits (i.e., functional diversity), implying modifications in species' composition, functional redundancy, and functional group turnover. Functional traits were similar for random forest classifications of the same natural cover but differed among landscapes. In the piedmont forests, social behavior-migratory status-was a functional trait combination common to all classifications, while foraging behavior-nest location trait combination was common to all forests scenarios in flooded savannas landscape classifications. Migratory status was a functional trait for all savanna classifications. Functional groups described the impacts of land-use changes on bird assemblages.

We found that 17 species of pollinator visited eight plant species (five agricultural plants and three weeds).

Traditionally, four morphological subspecies have been described, which recently have been molecularly confirmed. However, no population genetics studies have been carried out throughout the geographical distribution of one of these subspecies, Lagothrix lagothricha poeppigii. For this reason, we analyzed nine mitochondrial genes of L. l. poeppigii mainly collected from the Ecuadorian and Peruvian Amazon in order to better understand the evolutionary history of this taxon. The mitochondrial genetic diversity levels (haplotype and nucleotide diversity) we estimated are likely the highest yet reported for L. lagothricha. Our results did not detect important genetic structure within L. l. poeppigii. Furthermore, our phylogenetic analyses did not detect any relevant molecular cluster in the area where Groves hypothesized the existence of L. poeppigii castelnaui. Therefore, based on these data, castelnaui is not a valid taxon from a molecular perspective. The most differentiated subpopulation within L. l. poeppigii was from Morona-Santiago province (Ecuador) and had a genetic distance of 0.8-1.2% relative to the other subpopulations studied.

Susceptibility of Epitrix cucumeris and Pandeleteius cinereus adults was evaluated by individually exposing adults to 50 infective juveniles. EPNs were allegedly detected at two sampled sites (natural forest and coffee cultivation) in 5.8% of the samples analyzed. However, only natural forest EPN's could be isolated and multiplied. The isolate was identified as Steinernema carpocapsae BPS and its bacterial symbiont as Xenorhabus nematophila BPS.

The microbe has been associated with its host for more than 100,000 years and escorted modern humans out of Africa. H. pylori is predominantly transmitted within families and dispersed globally, resulting in distinct phylogeographic patterns, which can be utilized to investigate migrations and bioturbation events in human history. Latin America was affected by several human migratory waves due to the Spanish colonisation that drastically changed the genetic load and composition of the bacteria and its host. Genetic evidence indicates that independent evolutionary lines of H. pylori have evolved in mestizos from Colombia and other countries in the region during more than 500 years since colonisation. The vacuolating cytotoxin VacA represents a major virulence factor of the pathogen comprising two domains, p33 and p55, the latter of which is essential for binding to the host epithelial cell. The evolution of the VacA toxin in Colombia has been strongly biased due to the effects of Spanish colonization. However, the variation patterns and microevolution of the p55 domain have not yet been described for this population. In the present study, we determined the genetic polymorphisms and deviations in the neutral model of molecular evolution in the p55 domain of 101 clinical H. pylori isolates collected in Bogota, a city located in Andean mountains characterized by its high gastric cancer risk and its dominant mestizo population. The microevolutionary patterns of the p55 domain were shaped by recombination, purifying and episodic diversifying positive selection. Furthermore, amino acid positions 261 and 321 in the p55 domain of VacA show a high variability among mestizos clinical subsets, suggesting that natural selection in H. pylori may operate differentially in patients with different gastric diseases.",Article,"Gutierrez-Escobar, A.J.; Bravo, M.M.; Acevedo, O.; Backert, S.",Positive selection; Gene convergence; Functional divergence; Helicobacter pylori; VacA; Evolution,Positive selection;Gene convergence;Functional divergence;Helicobacter pylori;VacA;Evolution;VACUOLATING CYTOTOXIN VACA;EGF RECEPTOR;TOXIN VACA;GENE;RECOMBINATION;DIVERSITY;INFECTION;SOFTWARE;PACIFIC,Colombia;Germany,2-s2.0-85074223482;2-s2.0-85074223482

The number of species in the genus varies from one to nine, depending on the author, and there are at least 18 known karyotypes, varying from 2n = 46 to 2n = 58. Historically, night monkeys are divided into two species groups: red- and grey-necked groups from south and north of the AmazonSolimo similar to es River, respectively. Here, we used 10 nuclear and 10 mitochondrial molecular markers from a wide taxonomic and geographic sample to infer phylogeny, divergence times, and biogeography of the genus. For phylogenetic reconstruction we used Maximum Likelihood (ML) and Bayesian Inferences (BI). Biogeographic models were generated using the 'BioGeoBEARS' software. We found support for nine taxa of Aotus and rejected the existence of monophyletic ""red necked"" and ""grey necked"" species groups. We suggest a taxonomic reclassification of the genus, which is better represented by two clades named northern group, which contains Aotus miconax, A. nancymae, A. trivirgatus, A. vociferans, A. lemurinus, A. griseimembra, A. zonalis, and A. brumbacki, and southern group, which contains A. nigriceps, A. boliviensis, A. infulatus, and A. azarae. The results suggest that the most recent common ancestor of all species of Aotus arose in the central Amazon basin in the Early Pliocene. The evolutionary history of night monkeys was guided by dispersal, vicariance and founder events. The end of the Andean uplift and the subsequent changes in the Amazon landscape, as well as the Amazon-Solimo similar to es and Tapaj ' os rivers may have played an important role in the origin and diversification of Aotus, respectively. However, most of the Amazonian rivers seem not to have been geographical barriers to dispersal of night monkeys.

In Colombia, the Macaregua cave is known for its bat richness; thus, because bats are reservoir hosts of human microbiological pathogens, we determined if the Macaregua cave bats harbored Leptospira in the wild. A total of 85 kidney samples were collected from three bat species (Carollia perspicillata, Mormoops megalophylla, and Natalus tumidirostris) to detect Leptospira spp. The 16S rRNA gene was targeted through conventional PCR and qPCR; in addition, the LipL32 gene was detected using conventional PCR. Obtained amplicons were purified and sequenced for phylogenetic analysis. The Leptospira spp. 16S rRNA gene was detected in 51.8% bat kidneys, of which 35 sequences were obtained, all clustering within the pathogenic group. Moreover, 11 sequences presented high-identity-values with Leptospira noguchii, Leptospira alexanderi, Leptospira borgpetersenii, Leptospira kirschneri, and Leptospira mayottensis. From the 16S rRNA Leptospira spp.-positive population samples, 28 amplified for the LipL32 gene, and 23 sequences clustered in five different phylogenetic groups.

Although many hypotheses try to explain the processes underlying biological invasions, changes in land use are essential drivers mediating the colonization of exotic species at the landscape level. We used potential species distribution models developed in Maxent and a database of nine functional traits associated with invasion success for 18 exotic species with a high risk of establishment and difficulty of control in the Orinoco region from Colombia. We found that 67% of the species differed from the centroid in the climatic niche when comparing native and invaded localities. Overall, the native distribution localities showed a more restricted dispersal in their climatic niche, and for most species, native distribution was found within the broad environmental gradients of the invaded localities. Additionally, we found high climatic suitability for all exotic species across all the biomes and ecosystems; however, transformed ecosystems showed exotic plant species' higher potential functional richness.

Although prioritization efforts have been done in important areas for conservation that have included freshwater fish, they have only considered richness, endemism, and threat status which are insufficient to represent the geographical variability and the distribution patterns of species. In this work, prioritization for the conservation of fishes in the Andean Orinoco is proposed based on three approaches: identification of areas of endemism, risk, and complementarity. The three approaches coincide in the prioritization of the Ariari river sub-basin as the most important for fish conservation, followed by the Guamal River sub-basin, together encompassing 72.35 % of the Andean Orinoco ichthyofauna. Although 47.07% of the study area belongs to some type of protected area, only 0.97 % of the fish records come from national protected areas and 14.8 % from regional areas, highlighting the low knowledge of the freshwater fish diversity in these areas.

Rodents are the biggest seed predators in Neotropical ecosystems, however, fragmentation affects their presence, therefore seed predation. Materials and methods. The percentage and removal rate of seeds by rodents was recognized in areas of interior, borderline and pasture of a dry forest in the area of Cerritos - La Virginia (Risaralda-Colombia). Between March and July 2003, rodents present in the forest were identified with the aid of 60 Sherman traps located in different areas of the fragment. To obtain the percentage and removal rate of seeds by rodents, two experiments were conducted, (the first in June and the second one in July) with a random block design, using three types of closures: total (access to insects), partial (access to rodents) and control, (access to any organism), taking into account the location within the fragment (interior, borderline, or pasture).

The successional process, which governs the recovery of forests structure and composition, is determined by multiple factors that operate at different scales and are related in complex ways. These contingencies may lead secondary forests towards unpredictable successional trajectories. In Colombia, successional forests are an integral part of the landscape, their area is increasing, and can be considered essential allies to achieve restoration goals; however, their ecological value has not been considered in conservation agendas. For this reason, our objective was to evaluate the state-of-the-art in knowledge about successional forests in Colombia to make research opportunities visible. We calculated the area occupied by successional forests in Colombia, as well as in the different regions of the country and we performed a review of the published literature on the research of these forests in the country. Finally, we proposed some considerations for their future study. In brief, successional forests are dynamic ecosystems, both taxonomically and functionally, which should be considered crucial elements of transformed landscapes, and thereby have the possibility of being integrated into large-scale conservation and restoration projects.

In contrast, soil animals are considered key regulators of decomposition at local scales but their role at larger scales is unresolved. Soil animals are consequently excluded from global models of organic mineralization processes. Incomplete assessment of the roles of soil animals stems from the difficulties of manipulating invertebrate animals experimentally across large geographic gradients. This is compounded by deficient or inconsistent taxonomy. We report a global decomposition experiment to assess the importance of soil animals in C mineralization, in which a common grass litter substrate was exposed to natural decomposition in either control or reduced animal treatments across 30 sites distributed from 43 degrees S to 68 degrees N on six continents. Animals in the mesofaunal size range were recovered from the litter by Tullgren extraction and identified to common specifications, mostly at the ordinal level. The design of the trials enabled faunal contribution to be evaluated against abiotic parameters between sites. Soil animals increase decomposition rates in temperate and wet tropical climates, but have neutral effects where temperature or moisture constrain biological activity. Our findings highlight that faunal influences on decomposition are dependent on prevailing climatic conditions. We conclude that (1) inclusion of soil animals will improve the predictive capabilities of region- or biome-scale decomposition models, (2) soil animal influences on decomposition are important at the regional scale when attempting to predict global change scenarios, and (3) the statistical relationship between decomposition rates and climate, at the global scale, is robust against changes in soil faunal abundance and diversity.",Article,"Wall, D.H.; Bradford, M.A.; St John, M.G.; Trofymow, J.A.; Behan-Pelletier, V.; Bignell, D.D.E.; Dangerfield, J.M.; Parton, W.J.; Rusek, J.; Voigt, W.; Wolters, V.; Gardel, H.Z.; Ayuke, F.O.; Bashford, R.; Beljakova, O.I.; Bohlen, P.J.; Brauman, A.; Flemming, S.; Henschel, J.R.; Johnson, D.L.; Jones, T.H.; Kovarova, M.; Kranabetter, J.M.; Kutny, L.; Lin, K.C.; Maryati, M.; Masse, D.; Pokarzhevskii, A.; Rahman, H.; Sabara, M.G.; Salamon, J.A.; Swift, M.J.; Varela, A.; Vasconcelos, H.L.; White, D.; Zou, X.M.",climate decomposition index; decomposition; litter; mesofauna; soil biodiversity; soil carbon; soil fauna,climate decomposition index;decomposition;litter;mesofauna;soil biodiversity;soil carbon;soil fauna;LITTER DECOMPOSITION;TERRESTRIAL ECOSYSTEMS;BIODIVERSITY;QUALITY;DYNAMICS;PATTERNS,United States;New Zealand;Canada;United Kingdom;Australia;Czech Republic;Germany;Kenya;Russian Federation;France;Namibia;Taiwan;Malaysia;Burkina Faso;Brazil;Colombia;China,2-s2.0-54449101622

Litter decomposition recycles nutrients and causes large fluxes of carbon dioxide into the atmosphere. It is typically assumed that climate, litter quality and decomposer communities determine litter decay rates, yet few comparative studies have examined their relative contributions in tropical forests. 2. We used a short-term litterbag experiment to quantify the effects of litter quality, placement and mesofaunal exclusion on decomposition in 23 tropical forests in 14 countries. Annual precipitation varied among sites (760-5797 mm). At each site, two standard substrates (Raphia farinifera and Laurus nobilis) were decomposed in fine- and coarse-mesh litterbags both above and below ground for approximately 1 year. 3. Decomposition was rapid, with >95% mass loss within a year at most sites. Litter quality, placement and mesofaunal exclusion all independently affected decomposition, but the magnitude depended upon site. Both the average decomposition rate at each site and the ratio of above- to below-ground decay increased linearly with annual precipitation, explaining 60-65% of among-site variation. Excluding mesofauna had the largest impact on decomposition, reducing decomposition rates by half on average, but the magnitude of decrease was largely independent of climate. This suggests that the decomposer community might play an important role in explaining patterns of decomposition among sites. Which litter type decomposed fastest varied by site, but was not related to climate. 4. Synthesis. A key goal of ecology is to identify general patterns across ecological communities, as well as relevant site-specific details to understand local dynamics. Our pan-tropical study shows that certain aspects of decomposition, including average decomposition rates and the ratio of above- to below-ground decomposition are highly correlated with a simple climatic index: mean annual precipitation. However, we found no relationship between precipitation and effects of mesofaunal exclusion or litter type, suggesting that site-specific details may also be required to understand how these factors affect decomposition at local scales.",Article,"Powers, J.S.; Montgomery, R.A.; Adair, E.C.; Brearley, F.Q.; DeWalt, S.J.; Castanho, C.T.; Chave, J.; Deinert, E.; Ganzhorn, J.U.; Gilbert, M.E.; Gonzalez-Iturbe, J.A.; Bunyavejchewin, S.; Grau, H.R.; Harms, K.E.; Hiremath, A.; Iriarte-Vivar, S.; Manzane, E.; de Oliveira, A.A.; Poorter, L.; Ramanamanjato, J.B.; Salk, C.; Varela, A.; Weiblen, G.D.; Lerdau, M.T.",above ground; below ground; climate decomposition index; decomposition; decomposer fauna; litter type; precipitation; tropical forests,above ground;below ground;climate decomposition index;decomposition;decomposer fauna;litter type;precipitation;tropical forests;LEAF DECOMPOSITION;TERRESTRIAL ECOSYSTEMS;ROOT DECOMPOSITION;PLANT LITTER;SOIL;CLIMATE;MODEL;RATES;PATTERNS;CARBON,United States;United Kingdom;Brazil;France;Costa Rica;Germany;Mexico;Thailand;Argentina;Panama;India;Netherlands;Bolivia;Madagascar;Colombia,2-s2.0-67449128767;2-s2.0-67449128767

One way to investigate this is to see whether risk of later drug use in the sequence, conditional on use of drugs earlier in the sequence, changes according to time-space variation in use prevalence. We compared patterns and order of initiation of alcohol, tobacco, cannabis, and other illicit drug use across 17 countries with a wide range of drug use prevalence. Method: Analyses used data from World Health Organization (WHO) World Mental Health (WMH) Surveys, a series of parallel community epidemiological surveys using the same instruments and field procedures carried out in 17 countries throughout the world. Results: Initiation of ""gateway"" substances (i.e. alcohol, tobacco and cannabis) was differentially associated with subsequent onset of other illicit drug use based on background prevalence of gateway substance use. Cross-country differences in substance use prevalence also corresponded to differences in the likelihood of individuals reporting a non-normative sequence of substance initiation. Conclusion: These results suggest the ""gateway"" pattern at least partially reflects unmeasured common causes rather than causal effects of specific drugs on subsequent use of others. This implies that successful efforts to prevent use of specific ""gateway"" drugs may not in themselves lead to major reductions in the use of later drugs. (C) 2009 Elsevier Ireland Ltd.

In the high diversity country of Colombia, these types of analyses are difficult because there is no consistent wall-to-wall, multi-temporal dataset for land-use and land-cover change. Methodology/Principal Findings: To address this problem, we mapped annual land-use and land-cover from 2001 to 2010 in Colombia using MODIS (250 m) products coupled with reference data from high spatial resolution imagery (QuickBird) in Google Earth. We used QuickBird imagery to visually interpret percent cover of eight land cover classes used for classifier training and accuracy assessment. Based on these maps we evaluated land cover change at four spatial scales country, biome, ecoregion, and municipality. Of the 1,117 municipalities, 820 had a net gain in woody vegetation (28,092 km(2)) while 264 had a net loss (11,129 km(2)), which resulted in a net gain of 16,963 km(2) in woody vegetation at the national scale. Woody regrowth mainly occurred in areas previously classified as mixed woody/plantation rather than agriculture/herbaceous. The majority of this gain occurred in the Moist Forest biome, within the montane forest ecoregions, while the greatest loss of woody vegetation occurred in the Llanos and Apure-Villavicencio ecoregions. Conclusions: The unexpected forest recovery trend, particularly in the Andes, provides an opportunity to expand current protected areas and to promote habitat connectivity. Furthermore, ecoregions with intense land conversion (e.g. Northern Andean Paramo) and ecoregions under-represented in the protected area network (e.g. Llanos, Apure-Villavicencio Dry forest, and Magdalena-Uraba Moist forest ecoregions) should be considered for new protected areas.",Article,"Sanchez-Cuervo, A.M.; Aide, T.M.; Clark, M.L.; Etter, A.",,DEFORESTATION;MIGRATION;PATTERNS;MODIS;GLOBALIZATION;BIODIVERSITY;ECOREGIONS;DRIVERS,United States;Colombia,2-s2.0-84865590370
,,,112,WOS:000551385400006,2020,Global status and conservation potential of reef sharks,"Fishing has had a profound impact on global reef shark populations, and the absence or presence of sharks is strongly correlated with national socio-economic conditions and reef governance. Decades of overexploitation have devastated shark populations, leaving considerable doubt as to their ecological status(1,2). Yet much of what is known about sharks has been inferred from catch records in industrial fisheries, whereas far less information is available about sharks that live in coastal habitats(3). Here we address this knowledge gap using data from more than 15,000 standardized baited remote underwater video stations that were deployed on 371 reefs in 58 nations to estimate the conservation status of reef sharks globally. Our results reveal the profound impact that fishing has had on reef shark populations: we observed no sharks on almost 20% of the surveyed reefs. Reef sharks were almost completely absent from reefs in several nations, and shark depletion was strongly related to socio-economic conditions such as the size and proximity of the nearest market, poor governance and the density of the human population.

We compared the geographical discrepancies and potential conservation implications of using two different climate models (Saga and Worldclim) in combination with the species modelling approach Maxent in Bolivia. We estimated ranges of selected bird and fern species biogeographically restricted to either humid montane forest of the northern Bolivian Andes or seasonal dry tropical forests (in the Andes and southern lowlands). Saga and Worldclim predicted roughly similar climate patterns of temperature that were significantly correlated. Precipitation layers of both climate models were also roughly similar, but showed important differences. Species ranges estimated with Worldclim and Saga likewise produced different results. Ranges of species endemic to humid montane forests estimated with Saga had higher AUC (Area under the curve) values than those estimated with Worldclim, which for example predicted the occurrence of humid montane forest bird species near Lake Titicaca, an area that is clearly unsuitable for these species. Likewise, Worldclim overpredicted the occurrence of fern and bird species in the lowlands of the Chapare region and well south of the Andean Elbow, where more seasonal biomes occur. By contrast, Saga predictions were coherent with the known distribution of humid montane forests in the northern Bolivian Andes. Estimated ranges of species endemic to seasonal dry tropical forests predicted with Saga and Worldclim were not statistically different in most cases. However, detailed comparisons revealed that Saga was able to distinguish fragments of seasonal dry tropical forests in rain-shadow valleys of the northern Bolivian Andes, whereas Worldclim was not. These differences highlight the neglected influence of climate layers on modelling results and the importance of using the most accurate climate data available when modelling species distributions.

These studies have reported a monotonic decrease in species richness with increasing elevation, but ignore the high taxonomic differentiation of each headwater assemblage that may generate high -diversity among them. Here, we analyzed how fish assemblages vary with elevation among regional elevation bands, and how these changes are related to four environmental clines and to changes in the distribution, habitat use, and the morphology of fish species. Using a standardized field sampling technique, we assessed three different diversity and two structural assemblage measures across six regional elevation bands located in the northern Andes (Colombia). Each species was assigned to a functional group based on its body shape, habitat use, morphological, and/or behavioral adaptations. Additionally, at each sampling site, we measured four environmental variables. Our analyses showed: (1) After a monotonic decrease in species richness, we detected an increase in richness in the upper part of the gradient; (2) diversity patterns vary depending on the diversity measure used; (3) diversity patterns can be attributed to changes in species distribution and in the richness and proportions of functional groups along the regional elevation gradient; and (4) diversity patterns and changes in functional groups are highly correlated with variations in environmental variables, which also vary with elevation. These results suggest a novel pattern of variation in species richness with elevation: Species richness increases at the headwaters of the northern Andes owing to the cumulative number of endemic species there.

DC trees on soil microbial community and enzymatic activities in intensive silvopastoral systems of Colombia,"Livestock production in Latin America has replaced tropical dry forests with conventional monocultures pastures (CP) that have degraded soils. As an alternative to CP, intensive silvopastoral systems (ISS) have been developed with multi-canopied vegetation that mimics native forest (F). The litter inputs and year-round presence of the tree rhizosphere in ISS, contribute to the formation of ""fertile islands,"" which is expected to impact biological activity and crop productivity. This study, investigated the impact of the conversion of CP to ISS, as well as the effect of canopy of Prosopis juliflora trees in a chronosequence of ISS (3-15 years) on soil microbial communities and the physicochemical properties of soil. FAME (fatty acid methyl ester) profiles indicated that soil microbial community structure and composition shifted depending on land management systems. CP promoted the dominance of G(-) bacteria, while 155 chronosequence and F favored actinomycetes and fungal biomass (total and arbuscular mycorrhizal fungi). In addition, soil microbial community (FAME profiles) of ISS chronosequence and F were more similar than with CP. An increase in the Cy/pre FAME ratio in CP suggested that the microbial community was under higher stress. The advantage of including trees in pasture systems was reinforced by the observation that FAME biomarkers, enzymatic activities and nutrient status were significantly higher beneath the canopy of P. juliflora. The results indicate that ISS are viable alternatives for improving soil quality and metabolic function, which is reflected in the significant increase in microbial biomass, FAME biomarkers and enzyme activities compared with CP.

Linear models reveal the influence of climatic conditions, habitat size and sub-basin isolation on species diversity. Unexpectedly, the species richness model also highlighted a negative upriver-downriver gradient, contrary to predictions of increasing richness at more downriver locations along fluvial gradients. This reverse gradient may be linked to the history of the Amazon drainage network, which, after isolation as western and eastern basins throughout the Miocene, only began flowing eastward 1-9 million years (Ma) ago.

Of particular concern for conservation planning are 'biodiversity hotspots' where high concentrations of endemic species undergo rapid loss and fragmentation of habitat. We investigate the deforestation process in Caqueta, a biodiversity hotspot and major colonization front of the Colombian Amazon using multi-temporal satellite imagery of the periods 1989-1996-1999-2002. The probabilities of deforestation and regeneration were modeled against soil fertility, accessibility and neighborhood terms, using logistic regression analysis. Deforestation and regeneration patterns and rates were highly variable across the colonization front. The regional average annual deforestation rate was 2.6%, but varied locally between -1.8% (regeneration) and 5.3%, with maximum rates in landscapes with 40-60% forest cover and highest edge densities, showing an analogous pattern to the spread of disease. Soil fertility and forest and secondary vegetation neighbors showed positive and significant relationships with the probability of deforestation. For forest regeneration, soil fertility had a significant negative effect while the other parameters were marginally significant. The logistic regression models across all periods showed a high level of discrimination power for both deforestation and forest regeneration, with ROC values > 0.80. We document the effect of policies and institutional changes on the land clearing process, such as the failed peace process between government and guerillas in 1999-2002, which redirected the spread of deforestation and increased forest regeneration.

We present an adjusted multidimensional spatial human footprint index (SHFI) to analyze the effects of landscape transformation on the remnant habitat connectivity for 40 terrestrial mammal species representative of the Trans-Mexican Volcanic System in Michoacan (TMVSmich), in western central Mexico. We adjusted the SHFI by adding fragmentation and habitat loss to its original three components: land use intensity, time of human landscape intervention, and biophysical vulnerability. The adjusted SHFI was applied to four scenarios: one grouping all species and three grouping several species by habitat spatial requirements. Using the SHFI as a dispersal resistance surface and applying a circuit theory based approach, we analyzed the effects of cumulative human impact on habitat connectivity in the different scenarios. For evaluating the relationship between habitat loss and connectivity, we applied graph theory-based equivalent connected area (ECA) index. Results show over 60% of the TMVSmich has high SHFI values, considerably lowering current flow for all species. Nevertheless, the effect on connectivity of human impact is higher for species with limited dispersal capacity (100-500 m). Our approach provides a new form of evaluating human impact on habitat connectivity that can be applied to different scales and landscapes. Furthermore, the approach is useful for guiding discussions and implementing future biodiversity conservation initiatives that promote landscape connectivity as an adaptive strategy for climate change.

Forest clearing is often spatially concentrated in regions where human land use pressures, either planned or unplanned, increase the likelihood of deforestation. However, it is not a random process, but often moves in waves originating from settled areas. We investigate the spatial dynamics of land cover change in a tropical deforestation hotspot in the Colombian Amazon. We apply a forest cover zoning approach which permitted: calculation of colonization speed; comparative spatial analysis of patterns of deforestation and regeneration; analysis of spatial patterns of mature and recently regenerated forests; and the identification of local-level hotspots experiencing the fastest deforestation or regeneration. The colonization frontline moved at an average of 0.84 km yr(-1) from 1989 to 2002, resulting in the clearing of 3400 ha yr(-1) of forests beyond the 90% forest cover line. The dynamics of forest clearing varied across the colonization front according to the amount of forest in the landscape, but was spatially concentrated in well-defined 'local hotspots' of deforestation and forest regeneration. Behind the deforestation front, the transformed landscape mosaic is composed of cropping and grazing lands interspersed with mature forest fragments and patches of recently regenerated forests.

Savannas, which cover approximately 269 million ha in South America, play a major role in the global carbon cycle. They are affected by increasing human pressures and global climate change. Using satellite data, this study quantifies vegetation burning in the Colombian Llanos savannas for the period 2000-2008, and analyzes how fire spatial pattern, frequency and extent vary with ecosystem type, land tenure and rainfall. On average 2.75 +/- 0.5 million ha (24 +/- 4.2%) of the savannas burn each year. Burned area is highly variable, with 3.4 million ha burned in 2002-2003 and < 1.9 million ha in 2005-2006. However, during the 2000-2008 period near of 3.7 million ha (33.5%) of the savannas never burned. Compared with the average 8-10 years of fire return time for the tropics and subtropics, these savannas burn twice as often. In addition, the average burn size figure for tropical and subtropical grassland savannas (with < 5% trees) of 7000 ha (median 5000 ha), is about seven times the average burned patch size we found in our study. Fires predominate in the well-drained high plain savannas, lowest figures occurring along the Andean foothills, in forested areas and in pasture and croplands.

Humans are converting natural ecosystems and appropriating an increasingly large portion of the net primary productivity of the Earth's ecosystems, leaving a rapidly expanding footprint on the environment and threatening the functioning of ecosystems and the ecological services they provide. Understanding the impacts of human activities on the environment from a local to a global scale requires an adequate representation of human modified landscapes and an explanation of the relationships between socioeconomic and biophysical factors. A first step towards this objective is the development of a quantitative measure of the spatial footprint of humans on landscapes, which can then be used as an analytical and monitoring tool for global change, biodiversity and ecosystem studies. Existing approaches have been based mainly on geographic proxies of human influence such as population density, land transformation, accessibility and infrastructure. In this paper, we developed a more comprehensive and spatially-explicit footprint index based on three dimensions: land use intensity, intervention time, and biophysical vulnerability, which we then applied to Colombia as a case study. We found the inclusion of the vulnerability index provided an effective means to address regional variability in biophysical responses to land use impacts. Accounting for the duration of human intervention provided new insights into the relative capacity of ecosystems to recover or be restored.

Lowland tapir (Tapirus terrrestris, Perissodactyla, Tapiridae) is the largest Neotropical herbivore whose ancestors arrived in South America during the Great American Biotic Interchange. A Pleistocene diversification is inferred for the genus Tapirus from the fossil record, but only two species survived the Pleistocene megafauna extinction. Here, we investigate the history of lowland tapir as revealed by variation at the mitochondrial gene Cytochrome b, compare it to the fossil data, and explore mechanisms that could have shaped the observed structure of current populations. Results: Separate methodological approaches found mutually exclusive divergence times for lowland tapir, either in the late or in the early Pleistocene, although a late Pleistocene divergence is more in tune with the fossil record. Bayesian analysis favored mountain tapir (T. pinchaque) paraphyly in relation to lowland tapir over reciprocal monophyly, corroborating the inferences from the fossil data these species are sister taxa. A coalescent-based analysis rejected a null hypothesis of allopatric divergence, suggesting a complex history. Based on the geographic distribution of haplotypes we propose (i) a central role for western Amazonia in tapir diversification, with a key role of the ecological gradient along the transition between Andean subcloud forests and Amazon lowland forest, and (ii) that the Amazon river acted as an barrier to gene flow. Finally, the branching patterns and estimates based on nucleotide diversity indicate a population expansion after the Last Glacial Maximum. Conclusions: This study is the first examining lowland tapir phylogeography. Climatic events at the end of the Pleistocene, parapatric speciation, divergence along the Andean foothill, and role of the Amazon river, have similarly shaped the history of other taxa. Nevertheless further work with additional samples and loci is needed to improve our initial assessment. From a conservation perspective, we did not find a correspondence between genetic structure in lowland tapir and ecogeographic regions proposed to define conservation priorities in the Neotropics.

Functional connectivity (FC) analysis represents a promising approach to identify early biomarkers in specific diseases. Yet, virtually no study has tested whether potential FC biomarkers prove to be reliable and reproducible across different centers. As such, their implementation remains uncertain due to multiple sources of variability across studies: the numerous international centers capable conducting FC research vary in their scanning equipment and their samples' socio-cultural background, and, more troublingly still, no gold-standard method exists to analyze FC. In this unprecedented study, we aim to address both issues by performing the first multicenter FC research in the behavioral-variant frontotemporal dementia (bvFTD), and by assessing multiple FC approaches to propose a gold-standard method for analysis. We enrolled 52 bvFTD patients and 60 controls from three international clinics (with different fMRI recording parameters), and three additional neurological patient groups. To evaluate FC, we focused on seed analysis, inter-regional connectivity, and several graph-theory approaches. Only graph-theory analysis, based on weighted-matrices, yielded consistent differences between bvFTD and controls across centers. Also, graph metrics robustly discriminated bvFTD from the other neurological conditions. The consistency of our findings across heterogeneous contexts highlights graph-theory as a potential gold-standard approach for brain network analysis in bvFTD. Hum Brain Mapp 38:3804-3822, 2017.

Annual large-scale inundation of floodplains and their associated wetlands regulates water, nutrient, and sediment cycles, which in turn sustain a wealth of ecological processes and ecosystem services, including critical food supplies. In this study, we implemented an integrated approach focused on key attributes of ecologically functional floodplains: (1) hydrologic connectivity between the river and the floodplain, and between upstream and downstream sections; (2) hydrologic variability patterns and their links to local and regional processes; and (3) the spatial scale required to sustain floodplain-associated processes and benefits, like migratory fish biodiversity. The implemented framework provides an explicit quantification of the nonlinear or direct response relationship of those considerations with hydropower development. The proposed framework was used to develop a comparative analysis of the potential effects of the hydropower expansion necessary to meet projected 2050 electricity requirements. As part of this study, we developed an enhancement of the Water Evaluation and Planning system (WEAP) that allows resolution of the floodplains water balance at a medium scale (similar to 1000 to 10 000 km(2)) and evaluation of the potential impacts of upstream water management practices. In the case of the Mompos Depression wetlands, our results indicate that the potential additional impacts of new hydropower infrastructure with respect to baseline conditions can range up to one order of magnitude between scenarios that are comparable in terms of energy capacity. Fragmentation of connectivity corridors between lowland floodplains and upstream spawning habitats and reduction of sediment loads show the greatest impacts, with potential reductions of up to 97.6 and 80 %, respectively, from pre-dam conditions. In some development scenarios, the amount of water regulated and withheld by upstream infrastructure is of similar magnitude to existing fluxes involved in the episodic inundation of the floodplain during dry years and, thus, can also induce substantial changes in floodplain seasonal dynamics of average-to-dry years in some areas of the Mompos Depression.",Article,"Angarita, H.; Wickel, A.J.; Sieber, J.; Chavarro, J.; Maldonado-Ocampo, J.A.; Herrera, G.A.; Delgado, J.; Purkey, D.",,MAGDALENA RIVER;HYDROLOGICAL ALTERATIONS;FISH;DAMS;FLOODPLAIN;PATTERNS;TRENDS;CONNECTIVITY;RESERVOIRS;RESOURCES,Colombia;United States;France,2-s2.0-85046791825;2-s2.0-85046791825

The genetic structure of this population was evaluated using 12 microsatellite loci (n = 62 samples). In addition, 22 jaguar DNA samples from Guatemala, Paraguay, Peru, Bolivia, Venezuela and Brazil were analyzed for these microsatellite loci (n = 84 samples). The results of this study indicate six primary themes. First, the levels of gene diversity were very high. Second, the majority of the loci analyzed showed an absence of Hardy-Weinberg equilibrium, probably due to the Wahlund effect (= population subdivision). Third, several microsatellite loci showed significant heterogeneity between the two supposed subspecies in the country. Nevertheless, gene flow was present between them, and heterogeneity was relatively low, although the assignment analyses showed good classification of the jaguars studied into their respective subspecies. Fourth, the long-term historical effective population sizes were calculated through a maximum likelihood procedure for single and multi-step mutation models. Fifth, seven out of twelve DNA microsatellites studied significantly deviated from a single-step mutation model. However, the overall mean multi-step mutation percentage for these 12 DNA microsatellites was only 6%. Therefore, 94% of mutations were uni-step.

We evaluated the effects of habitat patch size and matrix type on diversity, isolation, and dispersal of ithomiine butterflies in forest fragments surrounded by coffee agroecosystems in the Colombian Andes. Because ithomiines prefer a shaded understory, we expected the highest diversity and abundance in large fragments surrounded by shade coffee and the lowest in small fragments surrounded by sun coffee. We also thought shade coffee would favor butterfly dispersal and immigration into forest patches. We marked 9675 butterflies of 39 species in 12 forest patches over a year. Microclimate conditions were more similar to the forest interior in the shade-coffee matrix than in the sun-coffee matrix, but patch size and matrix type did not affect species richness and abundance in forest fragments. Furthermore, age structure and temporal recruitment patterns of the butterfly community were similar in all fragments, independent of patch size or matrix type. There were no differences in the numbers of butterflies flying in the matrices at two distances from the forest patch, but their behavior differed. Flight in the sun-coffee matrix was rapid and directional, whereas butterflies in shade-coffee matrix flew slowly. Seven out of 130 recaptured butterflies immigrated into patches in the shade-coffee matrix, and one immigrated into a patch surrounded by sun coffee. Although the shade-coffee matrix facilitated movement in the landscape, sun-coffee matrix was not impermeable to butterflies. Ithomiines exhibited behavioral plasticity in habitat use and high mobility. These traits favor their persistence in heterogeneous landscapes, opening opportunities for their conservation.

This study represents a first report of modes of fragmentation and their relative importance to population growth in Palythoa caribaeorum (Cnidaria, Zoanthidea). Several populations at two coastal sites in Brazil (Praia Portinho, on Sao Sebastiao island, and Ponta Recife, on the Sao Paulo coast) were followed for 1 yr. Two depths in the sub-tidal were examined at each site: 0.5-1.5 m and 2.5-4.0 m. These sites represented different habitats characterized by different levels of environmental stress. Fragments were produced by two methods: (1) biotic fragmentation (tissue isolated due to biologically caused lesions); in this case, primarily due to disease causing partial colony mortality in the colony; and (2) physical fragmentation (colonies broken into several pieces by storms, currents, or tides). Both modes involved incidental fragmentation, not actively directed by the parent colony. Of the 579 colonies monitored 6.9% exhibited at least one mode of fragmentation over the period of 1 yr, producing 64 new ramets. The frequency of fragmentation, or total number of fragments produced from both modes of fragmentation, was independent of site and season, but not of depth. Significantly higher fragmentation was observed in shallower waters. This pattern could be explained by higher biotic fragmentation due to disease in these colonies. The frequency of colonies fragmenting by physical disturbance (storms) was found to be independent of site, depth, and season. At least 57% of the population exhibited signs of partial colony mortality (lesions), which on the average affected <5% of the total colony area. Partial colony mortality rarely resulted in ramet formation (9.7%). Of this 9.7%, 5.5% developed fragments as a result of partial mortality due to disease and 4.1% due to storm damage. A significant positive linear relationship was found between colony area and degree of partial mortality. When compared to other species of zoanthids, fragmentation plays an important role in asexual reproduction and potential contribution to population growth. It is not, however, as important as some other reproductive modes also utilized by this group.",Article,"Acosta, A.; Sammarco, P.W.; Duarte, L.F.",,POPULATION-DYNAMICS;COMPETITIVE STRATEGIES;PARTIAL MORTALITY;CLONAL CNIDARIAN;CORAL;REEF;ANTHOZOA;GROWTH;PROPAGATION;PATTERNS,Colombia;United States;Brazil,2-s2.0-0034934220;2-s2.0-0034934220

We analyzed secondary forest and shrubland dynamics over 30 years (1985-2015) in a densely populated area of the Colombian Andes using satellite and biophysical data. We performed a land-cover change analysis, assessed landscape fragmentation, and applied regression models to evaluate the effects of environmental and geographical correlates with the observed forest transitions. Forest cover area increased during the 30 year-span, due mostly to forest regrowth in areas marginal for agriculture, especially during the first half of the study period. However, a high dynamic of both forest regrowth and clearing near urban centers and roads was observed. Soil fertility turned out to be a key correlate of both forest recovery and deforestation. Secondary forests, < 30 years old represent the most fragmented component. Our findings reflect the complexity of the processes occurring in highly transformed and densely populated regions.

Eight environmental and structural variables were measured to characterize the species' habitats and to determine which was most important in structuring amphibian patterns. After a total of 432 man-hours sampling effort, 513 individuals from 32 amphibian species were found. Although the species richness was similar among the vegetation cover types, the composition of the ensembles and total amphibian abundance were different in each case. In addition, a strong relationship was found between changes in the vegetation structure and the amphibian pattern, with the canopy cover being the key variable in the composition of the ensembles for each cover type. Habitats with over 76% canopy cover, combined with a high density of individual woody plants (> 176 individuals per 500 m(2)) and a high depth of leaf litter (> 16 cm), provide the necessary habitat conditions for typical rainforest composition of amphibian species. However, for amphibian ensembles to have a mature forest composition, the habitat must have a canopy cover over 89%, a density of woody plants exceeding 231 individuals per 500 m2, and a leaf litter depth above 23 cm.

Unlike most other organism groups, plant species can possess dormant life-history stages such as soil seed banks, which may help plant communities to resist or at least postpone the detrimental impact of global changes. This study investigates the potential for soil seed banks to achieve this. Location Europe. Time period 1978-2014. Major taxa studied Flowering plants. Methods Using a space-for-time/warming approach, we study plant species richness and composition in the herb layer and the soil seed bank in 2,796 community plots from 54 datasets in managed grasslands, forests and intermediate, successional habitats across a climate gradient. Results Soil seed banks held more species than the herb layer, being compositionally similar across habitats. Species richness was lower in forests and successional habitats compared to grasslands, with annual temperature range more important than mean annual temperature for determining richness. Climate and land-use effects were generally less pronounced when plant community richness included seed bank species richness, while there was no clear effect of land use and climate on compositional similarity between the seed bank and the herb layer. Main conclusions High seed bank diversity and compositional similarity between the herb layer and seed bank plant communities may provide a potentially important functional buffer against the impact of ongoing environmental changes on plant communities. This capacity could, however, be threatened by climate warming. Dormant life-history stages can therefore be important sources of diversity in changing environments, potentially underpinning already observed time-lags in plant community responses to global change. However, as soil seed banks themselves appear, albeit less, vulnerable to the same changes, their potential to buffer change can only be temporary, and major community shifts may still be expected.",Article,"Plue, J.; Van Calster, H.; Auestad, I.; Basto, S.; Bekker, R.M.; Bruun, H.H.; Chevalier, R.; Decocq, G.; Grandin, U.; Hermy, M.; Jacquemyn, H.; Jakobsson, A.; Jankowska-Blaszczuk, M.; Kalamees, R.; Koch, M.A.; Marrs, R.H.; Marteinsdottir, B.; Milberg, P.; Maren, I.E.; Pakeman, R.J.; Phoenix, G.K.; Thompson, K.; Vandvik, V.; Wagner, M.; Auffret, A.G.",climate change; Europe; forest; grassland; land&#8208; use change; plant biodiversity; soil seed bank,climate change;Europe;forest;grassland;land&#8208;use change;plant biodiversity;soil seed bank;SPECIES RICHNESS;EXTINCTION RISK;DIVERSITY;SIMILARITY;MAINTENANCE;LONGEVITY;PATTERNS;MAINTAIN;SPACE;TIME,Sweden;Belgium;Norway;Colombia;Netherlands;Denmark;France;Poland;Estonia;Germany;United Kingdom;Iceland,2-s2.0-85093520518;2-s2.0-85093520518

Interestingly, many trees and lianas that comprise the wet forests increase their productivity as a response to El Nino. Here, we quantify the abundance of migrating Marpesia chiron butterflies over 17yr and the production of new leaves of their hostplants over 9yr to test the generality of the El Nino migration syndrome, i.e., whether increased abundance of migrating insects and productivity of their food plants are associated with El Nino and La Nina events. We find that the quantity of M. chiron migrating across the Panama Canal was directly proportional to the sea surface temperature (SST) anomaly of the Pacific Ocean, which characterizes El Nino and La Nina events. We also find that production of new leaves by its larval host trees, namely Brosimum alicastrum, Artocarpus altilis, and Ficus citrifolia, was directly proportional to the SST anomaly, with greater leaf flushing occurring during the period of the annual butterfly migration that followed an El Nino event. Combining these and our previously published results for the migratory butterfly Aphrissa statira and its host lianas, we conclude that dry season rainfall and photosynthetically active radiation can serve as primary drivers of larval food production and insect population outbreaks in Neotropical wet forests, with drier years resulting in enhanced plant productivity and herbivore abundance.

Several studies have reported segregated fruiting seasons of melastomes, but this pattern is not widespread. The segregated fruiting phenologies of congeneric sympatric species may be an evolutionary response to reduce competition for seed dispersers. Alternatively, aggregated fruiting phenologies may be favoured if local fruit abundance attracts more frugivores, thus enhancing seed dispersal. We monitored melastome fruiting in transects over a 2-y period at a cloud-forest site in the Colombian Andes. Fruiting periods of nine melastome species were aggregated and fruiting peaks coincided with rainy seasons. In a separate 6-mo study, observations at focal plants revealed that 47 of 61 bird species fed on 10 species of melastome, representing 37.4% of feeding events observed. Melastomes were consumed by birds in a higher proportion than expected from their availability and peak melastome fruit abundance coincided with the breeding season of the frugivore community, when melastomes constituted 54% of feeding records.

In a novel set of mobile bed laboratory experiments with variable discharge, we demonstrate that vegetation colonization affects bank erosion rates, channel shape, channel sinuosity, and bar pattern. Our analyses compared the morphological evolution of channels with initially steady bars considering the following three scenarios: (1) channel without vegetation, (2) channel with vegetation added to the floodplains, and (3) channel with vegetation added to both the floodplains and the bar surfaces that emerge at low flows. Absence of vegetation produced the widest and shallowest channel with the lowest sinuosity. Floodplain vegetation in the second scenario reduced bank erosion and resulted in a deeper and more sinuous channel with shorter bars. In the third scenario, vegetation establishment on emerging bar surfaces intensified erosion on the opposing bank, enlarging the amplitude of bends. Enhanced sedimentation on vegetated bar areas increased both bar elevation and bar length compared to the second scenario. The results show that the colonization of bar surfaces by plants creates the conditions for new floodplain and island formation, fostering channel meandering and anabranching.

Euglossine (or orchid) bees are a diverse lineage of insect pollinators distributed throughout the American tropics, where they provide pollination services to a staggering diversity of flowering plant taxa. Elucidating the seasonal patterns of phylogenetic assembly and functional trait diversity of bee communities can shed new light into the mechanisms that govern the assembly of bee pollinator communities and the potential effects of declining bee populations. Male euglossine bees collect, store, and accumulate odoriferous compounds (perfumes) to subsequently use during courtship display. Thus, synthetic chemical baits can be used to attract and monitor euglossine bee populations. We conducted monthly censuses of orchid bees in three sites in the Magdalena valley of Colombia - a region where Central and South American biotas converge - to investigate the structure, diversity, and assembly of euglossine bee communities through time in relation to seasonal climatic cycles. In particular, we tested the hypothesis that phylogenetic community structure and functional trait diversity changed in response to seasonal rainfall fluctuations. All communities exhibited strong to moderate phylogenetic clustering throughout the year, with few pronounced bursts of phylogenetic overdispersion that coincided with the transition from wet-to-dry seasons. Despite the heterogeneous distribution of functional traits (e.g., body size, body mass, and proboscis length) and the observed seasonal fluctuations in phylogenetic diversity, we found that functional trait diversity, evenness, and divergence remained constant during all seasons in all communities. However, similar to the pattern observed with phylogenetic diversity, functional trait richness fluctuated markedly with rainfall in all sites. These results emphasize the importance of considering seasonal fluctuations in community assembly and provide a glimpse to the potential effects that climatic alterations may have on both pollinator communities and the ecosystem services they provide.",Article,"Ramirez, S.R.; Hernandez, C.; Link, A.; Lopez-Uribe, M.M.",Biodiversity patterns; euglossini; orchid bees; pollinators,Biodiversity patterns;euglossini;orchid bees;pollinators;MALE EUGLOSSINE BEES;BIODIVERSITY;APIDAE;CONSERVATION;HYMENOPTERA;PATTERNS,United States;Colombia,2-s2.0-84928770836;2-s2.0-84928770836

According to recent global estimates, degraded lands already account for at least 1 and up to 6 billion ha. Given high rates of habitat degradation and loss of biodiversity in human-dominated landscapes with high levels of ecosystem transformation, conventional approaches to conservation such as setting aside lands in protected areas, are not enough; in combination with ecosystem protection, ecological restoration is essential to ensure the conservation of biodiversity and delivery of ecosystem services. Despite recognition of the role of ecological restoration, the planning of restoration at the landscape scale remains a major challenge. Specifically, more studies are needed on developing restoration plans that maximize conservation and provisioning of ecosystem services, while minimizing competition with high-productivity land uses. We use Colombia, one of the world's mega-diversity countries in which ca. 25 % of ecosystems are listed as critically endangered (CR), as a test case for exploring the potential advantages of including the Red List of Ecosystems, a newly developed tool for assessing conservation value, in restoration planning. We identified restoration priorities focused on both high-risk ecosystems and low-productivity lands, to maximize conservation value and minimize land-use conflicts. This approach allowed us to identify over 6 M ha of priority areas for restoration, targeting the restoration of 31 (75 %) of the country's endangered ecosystems. Eight of the Regional Administrative Environmental Planning Areas (CARs) had greater than 20 % of their area identified as restoration priorities. We roughly estimated that the cost of restoring the prioritized areas with restoration through natural regeneration, using payment for ecosystem services (PES), would equal less than 50 % of the annual budget of the CARs. Our results are in sharp contrast (only 12 % agreement) with the priorities identified under the current National Restoration Strategy of Colombia, and highlight the potential contribution of the Red List of Ecosystems in refining and improving restoration planning strategies at both national and sub-national levels.",Article,"Etter, A.; Andrade, A.; Nelson, C.R.; Cortes, J.; Saavedra, K.",Ecosystems at risk; Environmental degradation; Prioritization; Land use trade-offs,Ecosystems at risk;Environmental degradation;Prioritization;Land use trade-offs;LAND-USE;ECOLOGICAL RESTORATION;CONSERVATION;BIODIVERSITY;EXPANSION;PATTERNS;MANAGEMENT;COLOMBIA;TIME,Colombia;United States,2-s2.0-85087117833;2-s2.0-85087117833;2-s2.0-85087117833

We used 15 pasture-edge-interior gradients and 12 permanent linear transects per gradient, sampling them on three occasions between January and December 2006. We recorded 35 species (pasture: 15, forest edge: 28, forest interior: 16). Reptile structure was different along the pasture-edge-interior gradient and the magnitude of the influence of the edge effect on the abundance of the most common species changed from the dry to rainy season. We identified seven ecological groups based on three fixed functional traits: species habit, size and reproductive mode. The proportion of species belonging to each ecological group was different between the pasture and forest habitats, but there were no differences between the forest edge and its interior. Four of the seven ecological groups inhabited pasture and the forest interior, and all of the ecological groups were represented in the forest edge. The ecological group with oviparous small and diurnal species accounted for the 50 % of the species inhabiting the forest interior. Reptile structure and ecological groups were both related to patch size, elevation, herbaceous cover, percentage of bare soil and temperature, but explanatory power differed. We suggest that the conservation and management of tropical dry forest reptiles should take into account species traits so that rather than using information for a single species, a more generalized community approach is used.",Article,"Carvajal-Cogollo, J.E.; Urbina-Cardona, J.N.",Reptile ensembles; Edge influence; Functional diversity; Functional trait; Environmental gradients; Habitat structure,Reptile ensembles;Edge influence;Functional diversity;Functional trait;Environmental gradients;Habitat structure;RAIN-FOREST;CONSERVATION;HERPETOFAUNA;FRAGMENTS;DYNAMICS;PATTERNS,Colombia,2-s2.0-84939981511;2-s2.0-84939981511

Riparian vegetation is a key component of the riverine landscape and is therefore essential for the natural rehabilitation of rivers. This complicates the design of morphological interventions, since riparian vegetation is influenced by and influences the river dynamics. Morphodynamic models, useful tools for project planning, should therefore include the interaction between vegetation, water flow and sediment processes. Most restoration projects are carried out in USA and Europe, where rivers are highly intervened and where the climate is temperate and vegetation shows a clear seasonal cycle. Taking into account seasonal variations might therefore be relevant for the prediction of the river morphological adaptation. This study investigates the morphodynamic effects of riparian vegetation on a re-meandered lowland stream in the Netherlands, the Lunterse Beek. The work includes the analysis of field data covering 5years and numerical modelling. The results allow assessment of the performance of a modelling tool in predicting the morphological evolution of the stream and the relevance of including the seasonal variations of vegetation in the computations. After the establishment of herbaceous plants on its banks, the Lunterse Beek did not show any further changes in channel alignment. This is here attributed to the stabilizing effects of plant roots together with the small size of the stream. It is expected that the morphological restoration of similarly small streams may result in important initial morphological adaptation followed by negligible changes after full vegetation establishment.

We will focus on cancer types with a good average prognosis when detected and treated adequately and which are prioritized in national policies and cancer plans: cancers of the breast, cervix, prostate, colorectum and childhood cancers. These cancers have a quite poor prognosis compared to high-income countries. We find that, despite having achieved an almost ""universal health coverage"", Colombia suffers serious problems in accessibility to preventative, diagnostic and treatment services for patients with cancer. People living in poverty have lower real access to all types of care, but other problems are due to lack of health literacy, beliefs and knowledge. Much can be gained by early detection, the advanced stages at diagnosis of many cancers can be avoided by increasing awareness amongst both the general public and health care professionals. Delays in diagnosis and treatment can be reduced, changes in legislation and bureaucratic processes, and increases in trained human resources and equipment is needed.

In 2013, a healthy coral reef was discovered in one of the least expected places within the Colombian Caribbean: at the entrance of Cartagena Bay, a highly-polluted system that receives industrial and sewage waste, as well as high sediment and freshwater loads from an outlet of the Magdalena River (the longest and most populated river basin in Colombia). Here we provide the first characterization of Varadero Reef's geomorphology and biological diversity. We also compare these characteristics with those of a nearby reference reef, Baru Reef, located in an area much less influenced by the described polluted system. Below the murky waters, we found high coral cover of 45.1% (+/- 3.9; up to 80% in some sectors), high species diversity, including 42 species of scleractinian coral, 38 of sponge, three of lobster, and eight of sea urchin; a fish community composed of 61 species belonging to 24 families, and the typical zonation of a Caribbean fringing reef. All attributes found correspond to a reef that, according to current standards should be considered in ""good condition''. Current plans to dredge part of Varadero threaten the survival of this reef.

Therefore, understanding whether dispersal strategies are associated with climate is of utmost importance, particularly in areas greatly exposed to climate change. We examined alpine plant communities located in the mountain summits of the tropical Andes across a 4,000-km latitudinal gradient. We investigated species dispersal strategies and tested their association with climatic conditions and their evolutionary history. We used dispersal-related traits (dispersal mode and growth form) to characterize dispersal strategies for 486 species recorded on 49 mountain summits. Then we analysed the phylogenetic signal of traits and investigated the association between dispersal traits, phylogeny, climate and space using structural equation modelling and fourth-corner analysis together with RLQ ordination. A median of 36% species in the communities was anemochorous (wind-dispersed) and herbaceous. This dispersal strategy was followed by the barochory-herb combination (herbaceous with unspecialized seeds, dispersed by gravity) with a median of 26.3% species in the communities. The latter strategy was common among species with distributions restricted to alpine environments. While trait states were phylogenetically conserved, they were significantly associated with a temperature gradient. Low minimum air temperatures, found at higher latitudes/elevations, were correlated with the prevalence of barochory and the herb growth form, traits that are common among Caryophyllales, Brassicaceae and Poaceae. Milder temperatures, found at lower latitudes/elevations, were associated with endozoochorous, shrub species mostly from the Ericaceae family. Anemochorous species were found all along the temperature gradient, possibly due to the success of anemochorous Compositae species in alpine regions. We also found that trait state dominance was more associated with the climatic conditions of the summit than with community phylogenetic structure. Although the evolutionary history of the tropical Andean flora has also shaped dispersal strategies, our results suggest that the environment had a more predominant role. Synthesis. We showed that dispersal-related traits are strongly associated with a gradient of minimum air temperatures in the Andes. Global warming may weaken this key filter at tropical alpine summits, potentially altering community dispersal strategies in this region and thus, plant community structure and composition.",Article,"Tovar, C.; Melcher, I.; Kusumoto, B.; Cuesta, F.; Cleef, A.M.; Meneses, R.I.; Halloy, S.; Llambi, L.D.; Beck, S.; Muriel, P.; Jaramillo, R.; Jacome, J.; Carilla, J.",alpine environments; dispersal traits; environmental filtering; fourth corner; paramo; plant community; puna; RLQ analysis,alpine environments;dispersal traits;environmental filtering;fourth corner;paramo;plant community;puna;RLQ analysis;POSITIVE INTERACTIONS;SEED DISPERSAL;R PACKAGE;PATTERNS;MECHANISMS;CLIMATE;TRAITS;DIVERSIFICATION;EVOLUTION;RADIATION,United Kingdom;Netherlands;Japan;Ecuador;Chile;New Zealand;Venezuela;Bolivia;Colombia;Argentina,2-s2.0-85087156060;2-s2.0-85087156060

To study the inequalities in various mortality indicators for the departments of Colombia with respect to national figures, and to identify associations between the departmental mortality indicators and departmental socioeconomic indicators. Methods. To determine mortality rates and the Gini coefficient for mortality for the departments, data from the death registry were adjusted by the estimated registry coverage for each of the departments. Five socioeconomic indicators were selected: Gini coefficient for income distribution, Human Development Index, per capita gross domestic product, per capita social investment ( in health care, etc.), and percentage of the population with health care services from the country's social security system. The differences among the departments were then studied and compared to the national averages. The Spearman's rank correlation coefficient was calculated to find associations between the mortality indicators and each of the five socioeconomic indicators. Results. For Colombia overall, death registry coverage was estimated at 76%, with Choco department having the lowest coverage ( 35%), and Caldas department the highest ( 88%). The associations between the Gini coefficient for mortality and four of the socioeconomic indicators studied were significant. The national mortality rate was significantly associated with one socioeconomic indicator. Death caused by diabetes mellitus was associated with all the socioeconomic indicators; death caused by undernutrition or by diarrhea, with four socioeconomic indicators; and death from traffic accidents, with two socioeconomic indicators. Homicide was not associated with any of the socioeconomic indicators studied. Conclusions. Adjusting the death registry data produced mortality indicators that were more valid for drawing associations with socioeconomic indicators. The Gini coefficient of mortality, mortality from undernutrition, and mortality from diarrheal diseases were more suitable indicators for evaluating the inequalities among the departments because of their higher levels of association with the socioeconomic indicators. Regarding diabetes- related mortality, the associations with all the socioeconomic indicators could be due to systematic errors that lesser- developed departments made when the cause of death was being assigned. A department is a large unit for analysis, which can make it difficult to identify associations between socioeconomic indicators and deaths due to homicide or traffic accidents.",Article,"Garcia, J.R.",health status indicators; mortality; life tables; socioeconomic factors; population characteristics; Colombia,"health status indicators;mortality;life tables;socioeconomic factors;population characteristics;Colombia;INCOME INEQUALITY;HEALTH;FARR,WILLIAM;DEPRIVATION;PATTERNS",Colombia,2-s2.0-34249900983

Such diversity is likely to be promoted by plant specialization, associated with the occurrence of a mosaic of landscape units. Here, we integrate ecological and phylogenetic data at different spatial scales to assess the importance of habitat specialization in driving compositional and phylogenetic variation across the Amazonian forest. To do so, we evaluated patterns of floristic dissimilarity and phylogenetic turnover, habitat association and phylogenetic structure in three different landscape units occurring in terra firme (Hilly and Terrace) and flooded forests (Igapo). We established two 1-ha tree plots in each of these landscape units at the Caparu Biological Station, SW Colombia, and measured edaphic, topographic and light variables. At large spatial scales, terra firme forests exhibited higher levels of species diversity and phylodiversity than flooded forests. These two types of forests showed conspicuous differences in species and phylogenetic composition, suggesting that environmental sorting due to flood is important, and can go beyond the species level. At a local level, landscape units showed floristic divergence, driven both by geographical distance and by edaphic specialization. In terms of phylogenetic structure, Igapo forests showed phylogenetic clustering, whereas Hilly and Terrace forests showed phylogenetic evenness. Within plots, however, local communities did not show any particular trend. Overall, our findings suggest that flooded forests, characterized by stressful environments, impose limits to species occurrence, whereas terra firme forests, more environmentally heterogeneous, are likely to provide a wider range of ecological conditions and therefore to bear higher diversity. Thus, Amazonia should be considered as a mosaic of landscape units, where the strength of habitat association depends upon their environmental properties.",Article,"Umana, M.N.; Norden, N.; Cano, A.; Stevenson, P.R.",,BETA-DIVERSITY;FLORISTIC COMPOSITION;FUNCTIONAL TRAITS;FOREST;PATTERNS;LIGHT;REGENERATION;COEXISTENCE;COMPETITION;TOLERANCE,Colombia,2-s2.0-84866513609

Computer-assisted diagnosis of AD based on image analysis is an emerging tool to support AD diagnosis. In this article, we explore the application of Supervised Switching Autoencoders (SSAs) to perform AD classification using only one structural Magnetic Resonance Imaging (sMRI) slice. SSAs are revised supervised autoencoder architectures, combining unsupervised representation and supervised classification as one unified model. In this work, we study the capabilities of SSAs to capture complex visual neurodegeneration patterns, and fuse disease semantics simultaneously. We also examine how regions associated to disease state can be discovered by SSAs following a local patch-based approach. Methods: Patch-based SSAs models are trained on individual patches extracted from a single 2D slice, independently for Axial, Coronal, and Sagittal anatomical planes of the brain at selected informative locations, exploring different patch sizes and network parameterizations. Then, models perform binary class prediction - healthy (CDR = 0) or AD-demented (CDR > 0) - on test data at patch level. The final subject classification is performed employing a majority rule from the ensemble of patch predictions. In addition, relevant regions are identified, by computing accuracy densities from patch-level predictions, and analyzed, supported by Atlas-based regional definitions. Results: Our experiments employing a single 2D T1-w sMRI slice per subject show that SSAs perform similarly to previous proposals that rely on full volumetric information and feature-engineered representations. SSAs classification accuracy on slices extracted along the Axial, Coronal, and Sagittal anatomical planes from a balanced cohort of 40 independent test subjects was 87.5%, 90.0%, and 90.0%, respectively. A top sensitivity of 95.0% on both Coronal and Sagittal planes was also obtained. Conclusions: SSAs provided well-ranked accuracy performance among previous classification proposals, including feature-engineered and feature learning based methods, using only one scan slice per subject, instead of the whole 3D volume, as it is conventionally done. In addition, regions identified as relevant by SSAs' were, in most part, coherent or partially coherent in regard to relevant regions reported on previous works.

We studied the factors that influence the perception of the Black-and-chestnut Eagle (Spizaetus isidori) in four rural Andean communities in Colombia and compiled historical and recent evidence on the persecution and other causes of mortality of this species in the country. We applied 267 questionnaires and conducted 16 interviews with local inhabitants, via visits to homes and schools in the surroundings of S. isidori nests. The perception of S. isidori by the inhabitants was largely negative and influenced by different socio-demographic factors such as gender, chicken (Gallus gallus) ownership, and chicken management. The records we obtained indicate that 47 eagles were shot, 16 were captured (three for illegal trafficking) and two were electrocuted on high-tension wires. The persecution of S. isidori occurs as retaliation or as a preventative measure against chicken predation, and is a significant cause of mortality of this species in Colombia. Effective conservation planning for S. isidori in Colombia needs to go further than the protected areas system, and include a socioecological perspective in conservation practices applied at landscapes scales that are dominated by people.

Differences in individual and population life-cycle regulation could be due to a marked seasonality in food supply, promoted by the bimodal rainfall that characterizes this ecosystem. Such population overlap of molt and reproduction could be due to individual variation within species. We found evidence of suspended prebasic and preformative molts in both species, thus promoting an overlap with prealternate molt when they restart. These are the first descriptions of the breeding and molting cycles for Blue-black Grassquit and Gray Seedeater in northern South America.",Article,"Moreno-Palacios, M.; Losada-Prado, S.; Echeverry-Galvis, M.A.",,TROPICAL BIRDS;AGE;REPRODUCTION;OVERLAP;SEASONALITY;POPULATION;MIGRATION;PATTERNS;GENDER;SYSTEM,Colombia;United States,

Additionally, the analysis included some GenBank sequences from southern, central and northeastern Brazil. The first mt set (mt ATP8+mt 165 rRNA with 41 tigrina) revealed the existence of seven different tigrina-like haplogroups. They could represent, at least, 4-6 different tigrina species following the Phylogenetic Species Concept (PSC). In the second mt set (mitogenomics with 18 tigrinas), we detected six different tigrina-like haplogroups. They could represent 4-5 different tigrina species - including a possible full new species, which has gone previously unnoticed to the world of science both morphologic and molecularly. Coat patterns of several of these different tigrinas support the molecular differences. We also detected intense hybridization in many Andean tigrina with margays (Leopardus wiedii) and ocelots (Leopardus pardalis) as well as hybridization of one Bolivian tigrina with Leopardus geoffroyi. Similar hybridization was found for many of the southern Brazilian tigrina (Leopardus guttulus). All of the temporal split estimates for these tigrina haplogroups, together with those of the Leopardus species recognized to date, began in the late Pliocene but mostly occurred during the Pleistocene. In agreement with the existence of multiple species within the traditional L. tigrinus species, we detected strong and significant spatial structure in the two mt data sets. There were clear circular clines. A major part of the analyses detected more genetic resemblance between the Central American + trans Andean Colombian and Ecuadorian tigrina (L. oncilla) with the most geographically distant tigrina from central and southern Brazil (L. guttulus; pure individuals not hybridized with L. geoffroyi). In comparison, the Andean tigrina taxa had intermediate geographical origins but were highly genetically differentiated both from the Central American +trans Andean Colombian-Ecuadorian tigrina and from the central and southern Brazilian tigrina.",Article,"Ruiz-Garcia, M.; Pinedo-Castro, M.; Shostell, J.M.",Tigrina; Leopardus; mitogenomics; hybridization; spatial structure,Tigrina;Leopardus;mitogenomics;hybridization;spatial structure;CAT POPULATIONS;GENETIC IDENTIFICATION;MAXIMUM-LIKELIHOOD;SOUTH-AMERICA;HYBRID ZONE;EVOLUTION;INTROGRESSION;PATTERNS;ORIGIN,Colombia;United States,

We registered 119 snakes belonging to 33 species. Traffic levels significantly influenced rates of snake road kill, while adjacent vegetation cover, rainfall seasonality, and landscape structure and composition did not. We classified the species into seven ecological groups based upon foraging strategy, body length, and habitat preferences. Although most of the road-killed species had an active foraging strategy, all of the ecological groups contained some species that were killed on the highway, as well as some species that inhabited adjacent vegetation cover but that were not detected on the highway. The different ecological groups were not associated with different landscape characteristics. Six of the 13 landscapes that presented the lowest species richness of road-killed species had a different ecological group represented by each of the species documented as road kills. Thus, considering the ecological group that a species belongs to provides a complementary analytical approach that permits a fuller understanding of the ecological effects of roads on the functional role of the species in the ecosystem.

To manage this conflict, it is important to understand the ecological circumstances associated with the predation of domestic animals. We studied variation in the diet of the endangered Black-and-chestnut Eagle (Spizaetus isidori) in four different Andean landscapes in Colombia. We analyzed 261 prey items brought to five S. isidori nests during the period when the nestlings were being raised. Domestic fowl are relatively frequent prey in the diet of S. isidori in three of the four localities studied (frequency: 9.3%-36%), representing 12.2% to 37.1% of the total biomass of prey consumed. In terms of biomass, in Ciudad Bolivar, Jardin, and Campohermoso, the sites with the greatest forest cover, mammals were the most important prey in the diet of S. isidori, while in Gachali, the most deforested site, domestic fowl were the most important prey. We recommend that forest cover be maintained and increased to provide habitat for wild prey in the breeding territories of S. isidori using the landscape management tools best suited to the specific socioecological contexts of this eagle's territories. We also suggest that the management of domestic fowl under controlled conditions or the use of some deterrent be examined as strategies to mitigate or prevent conflict between people and S. isidori.

Conserving this diversity requires plans to protect areas in each province, based on an understanding of their particular ecological conditions. In Colombia dry forest occurs in seven regions. We explored some challenges for conserving beta diversity at the country scale by downscaling the analysis and framing it in the context of the general knowledge status of the country's dry forests, and particularly of seed dispersal. Our literature review revealed 178 studies, with an increase in publication rate in recent years. The Cauca Valley and the Caribbean region had the most publications. More than half of studies were species inventories of plants, birds, and bats, whereas only ten studies dealt with plant-animal interactions and five with secondary succession. Analyses on plants, birds, and bats revealed high levels of dissimilarity among regions. One-half of plant species in Colombia's dry forests are dispersed by birds and mammals. Large-sized frugivorous birds and mammals are absent from remaining forest patches, which may negatively affect patterns of seed dispersal and secondary succession.

Results of the similarity analysis showed that the Cucuta valley avifauna is biogeographically more related to the arid inter-Andean river valleys than to the Caribbean plains of Colombia and the Caribbean lowlands of northern Venezuela. This pattern of biogeographical affinities of dry forest bird communities in northwestern South America seems to be explained by the effect of geographic distance rather than environmental differences shaping species composition (beta-diversity) and phylogenetic relatedness (phylo beta-diversity) across space.

This article seeks to describe, in depth, the time trend of incidence and mortality of GC in the city of Quito, from 1985 to 2013. Methods. Using data from the Quito Cancer Registry, annual sex-specific age-standardized incidence and mortality rates were calculated. The analysis included all types of GC together, as well as by histological subtype. Joinpoint regression analysis was performed to estimate the annual percentage change (EAPC). To evaluate cohort and period effects, Age-Period-Cohort (APC) modeling was performed. Results. Over time, incidence rate decreased from 30.4 to 18.8 cases in men and from 20.1 to 12.9 cases in women. The mortality rate decreased from 17.5 to 14.4 deaths in men and from 14.2 to 10.9 deaths in women. The incidence trend was composed of a first period (1986-1999) of strong decline (EAPC Men= -2.6, 95% Confidence Interval [CI]: -4.2, -0.9; EAPC Women= -3.2, 95% CI: -4.6, -1.9), followed by a less important decrease in men (EAPC= -0.8, 95% CI:-2.5, 0.9) and a slight increase in women (EAPC= 0.7, 95% CI: -1.4; 2.8). Mortality rates were constantly decreasing in both men (EAPC= -0.5, 95% CI: -0.9, -0.1) and women (EAPC= -0.9, 95% CI: -1.7, -0.1) throughout the period of analysis. Conclusions.

Organisms adjust their foraging strategies to optimize the energetic costs during foraging with respect to benefits gained. These strategies are usually different in males and females due to their specific requirements during reproduction. Knowing the temporal dietary composition and variation may help us understand how intrinsic factors can influence diet during the breeding season. Seba's short-tailed fruit bat (Carollia perspicillata) plays an important role in seed dispersal throughout the Neotropics. Seasonal dietary changes related to resource availability have been documented but dietary differences between males and females have not been analyzed. We tested the hypothesis that dietary breadth increases and varies between males and females of Carollia perspicillata during the breeding season. We collected 295 fecal samples (from 236 males and 182 females) between June 2012 and April 2013 at the Macaregua cave (Santander, Colombia). Sex, diet and overlap were recorded. Time series analysis of dietary variation were estimated and related to food (fruits and flowers) availability. Males were found to include 18 seed morphospecies within their diet, while females included 16 seed morphospecies. Ficus, Vismia and Acacia were the most commonly consumed plant genera within the diet of both males and females. The time series analysis throughout the year indicated that males had greater dietary diversity than females. Dietary richness for males peaked multiple times, while dietary richness for females peaked only once during the transition period between pregnancy and lactation. We recorded significant sex differences in the value of importance of plants in the diet, evenness, and dominance of plant species consumed, as well as differential consumption over the seasons. Knowing the variations in the diet allows us to address the differences between the foraging strategies that females and males use in response to energy demands, movement patterns and habitat use.

Methods. Household-level information from mothers 18-49 years old and their children <5 years old was included. Stunting and overweight were assessed for each child. Mothers were classified according to their body mass index. Four anthropometric typologies at the household level were constructed: normal, underweight, overweight, and dual burden. Four three-level [households (n = 8598) nested within municipalities (n = 226), nested within states (n = 32)] hierarchical polytomous logistic models were developed. Household log-odds of belonging to one of the four anthropometric categories, holding 'normal' as the reference group, were obtained. Results. This study found that anthropometric typologies were associated with maternal and family characteristics of maternal age, parity, maternal education, and wealth index. Higher municipal living conditions index was associated with a lower likelihood of underweight typology and a higher likelihood of overweight typology.

To assess this, the abundance of nine species of juvenile corals was correlated with eight macro-habitat (location of the reef on shelf, depth) and micro-habitat (type and inclination of the substrate, exposure to light, texture and amount of sediment accumulated on bottom, potential growth area for juveniles) conditions. Sampling was conducted in four insular coral reefs in the Colombian Caribbean: two oceanic and two continental reefs (influenced by large rivers), covering a total of 600m(2) and the distribution of corals on a vertical gradient. Contingency tables and coefficients (magnitude) and multiple correspondence analyses were used to evaluate the dependency ratios for each species. The results showed that Agaricia tenuifolia displayed the most robust pattern of dependence (two high and two moderate), significant for juveniles present at a high frequency in continental reefs, devoid of potential area for juvenile growth (surrounded by macroalgae), and covering horizontal substrates exposed to light. The juveniles were associated with a habitat of moderate to high bottom accumulation of extremely fine sediment. Ponies astreoides presented four moderate dependencies; ocean reefs between 2-16m depths, a high frequency of juveniles on horizontal substrates, exposed to light, non-sedimented and occupied by competitors. Siderastrea siderea displayed three moderate dependences for juveniles in cryptic zones, inclined substrate and devoid of competitors. A. lamarcki, Leptoseris cucullata and A. agaricites presented two moderate dependences; these species share high abundance of juveniles in habitats with no sediment, exposed to light and occupied by competitors (except A. agaricites). The P ponies, Favia fragum and Montastraea cavernosa species had a moderate dependence with high incidence of juveniles in ocean reefs and microhabitats exposed to light. For the nine species, results indicate that the presence (colonization), abundance and survival of juveniles, depend on certain species-specific particularities of the habitat. However, the juveniles show high tolerance and plasticity to a range of habitat variables, given their independence and low dependence observed in over 50% of the variables assessed. Rev. Biol.

Understanding the effects of these threats, and the role of Protected Areas in buffering their impacts, is becoming an essential task to prevent the loss of species. In this study, we used the woolly monkey, a keystone species with seed dispersal functions, as a surrogate to assess the future conservation potential of the Protected Areas in Colombia, a megadiverse country where important tropical forests remain. We modelled the ecological niche of the woolly monkey using an ensemble forecasting approach to assess potential distribution changes resulting from climate change and deforestation. Distribution changes in 2050 were estimated for two Representative Concentration Pathways (RCPs), three Global Circulation Models (GCMs) and one deforestation projection. Additionally, we evaluated the current and future suitable area for the species located within Protected Areas. For the year 2016, we estimated a potential distribution area for the woolly monkey of 413,533 km2 after accounting for deforestation. The future synergistic effect of climate change and deforestation could cause a reduction of up to-13 % in the species potential distribution in Colombia, mainly in the Andean-Amazonian foothills and the Amazon region. The distribution area lost due to climate change was exceeded by losses due to deforestation in all scenarios, where up to 65,356 km(2) could be lost as a result of forest clearance. The current Protected Area system will not be able to mitigate the impacts of climate and land-use changes, since-26 % of the woolly monkey's range is currently located within National Parks and Indigenous Reserves. This range could decrease by-18 % in the most drastic future scenario. Based on these results, we emphasize the need of an integrated approach of land-use planning that encompasses the creation, expansion and connectivity of Protected Areas, along with the strengthening of law enforcement capacity and restoration efforts to halt increasing deforestation. The effective implementation of these strategies is necessary to assist species to track their suitable climatic conditions, especially through the Andean-Amazonian foothills, and will contribute to the conservation of tropical biodiversity.",Article,"Linero, D.; Cuervo-Robayo, A.P.; Etter, A.",Climate change; Deforestation; Primates; Protected Areas; Umbrella species; Species distribution model,Climate change;Deforestation;Primates;Protected Areas;Umbrella species;Species distribution model;TROPICAL FOREST BIODIVERSITY;CLIMATE-CHANGE;LAND-USE;VULNERABILITY;EXTINCTION;SURROGATES;DISPERSAL;PATTERNS;ECOLOGY;MODELS,Colombia;Mexico,2-s2.0-85095934989

Studies addressing the identification of patterns and variations across several guilds are fundamental in ecomorphological research. Wings are the core of ecological morphology in bats; nevertheless, individual bones and structures that support the wing, including metacarpals, phalanges and the length of digits, have rarely been the subject of comprehensive research when studying wing morphology. Here, I analyzed morphological variations of wing structures across 11 bat guilds and how individual bone structures are correlated to diet, foraging mode and habitat use. I obtained wing measurements from 1512 voucher specimens of 97 species. All the specimens analyzed came from the Mammalian Collection at the Museo Javeriano de Historia Natural of Pontificia Universidad Javeriana (MPUJ-MAMM) (Bogota, Colombia). Positive correlations between size and the length of the third and fifth digit were detected. Bat guilds that capture their preys using aerial strategy in uncluttered habitats had longer third digits but short fifth digits compared to guilds that rely on gleaning strategy and forage in highly cluttered space. Although terminal phalanges were shown to be important structures for guild classification, metacarpals were strongly related to aerial foragers from uncluttered habitats because of their potential role in flight performance and ecological adaptations.

Among the xenarthrans, sloths constitute the most diverse paleontologically with almost 100 fossil genera recorded. However, this abundant sloth fauna in the Americas became extinct around 10,000 years ago. Only six species belonging to two genera,Bradypus(four three-toed sloth species) andCholoepus(two two-toed sloth species) are alive today in Central and South America.Bradypus variegatusis the sloth species with the widest geographical distribution in the Neotropics. Some regional population genetics have been reported, especially in Brazil, but with limited sample sizes. Herein, we sequenced 77 samples ofBradypys variegatus(Panama, Colombia, Venezuela, Peru, Bolivia, and Brazil; 65 new samples and 12 from GenBank), plus oneB. tridactylus, oneB. pygmaeus, and fiveB. torquatus(one new and four from GenBank) at the mitochondrial (mt) control region. Additionally, 25 of these samples, representing the four species, were sequenced for the entire mitochondrial genome. Our results indicate that there are at least six main genetically different haplogroups ofB. variegatus.They are the trans-Andean, western Amazon (with some other internal groups), Tapajos River, Tocantins River, Negro River, and the Brazilian eastern Atlantic forest (with two recognizable sub-groups in northern and southern areas) ones, with the ancestor of the trans-Andean haplogroup the first to diverge. A very strong genetic heterogeneity and a striking spatial pattern were detected among these different geographical areas, with the trans-Andean, western Amazon, and Tocantins populations showing the highest levels of genetic diversity, meanwhile the Tapajos and the Brazilian eastern populations yielding lower levels of genetic diversity. The following conclusions were as follows: 1)B. torquatusshould be considered as a different genus (Scaeopus) because of its extreme genetic differences from otherBradypustaxa as was previously claimed by other authors; 2)B. pygmaeusis not a recent species adapted to Holocene island environments from the Central AmericaB. variegatusgroup; and 3) if we adopt a strict version of the Phylogenetic Species Concept (PSC), the highly significant monophyletic clade of the trans-AndeanB. variegatuspopulation should be defined as a valid and differentiated species of three-toed sloth. However, we are reluctant to define this population as a new species until new data shows possible strong karyotype differences and/or pre- or post-zygote reproductive barriers (Biological Species Concept, BSC) between the trans and the cis-Andean populations of the three-toed brown-throated sloth.",Article,"Ruiz-Garcia, M.; Chacon, D.; Plese, T.; Shostell, J.M.",Bradypus; B; ephippiger; B; pygmaeus; Miocene; Mitochondrial control region; Mitogenomes; Pleistocene; Pliocene,Bradypus;B;ephippiger;pygmaeus;Miocene;Mitochondrial control region;Mitogenomes;Pleistocene;Pliocene;CAT POPULATIONS;BRADYPUS-TORQUATUS;STATISTICAL TESTS;ATLANTIC FOREST;SOUTH-AMERICA;DNA;PATTERNS;NEUTRALITY;DIVERSITY;XENARTHRA,Colombia;United States,2-s2.0-85064925582

It is also listed as vulnerable by IUCN and as endangered by CITES. We analyzed the genetic structure of this species in nine geographical regions representing the three Andean Cordilleras in Colombia. We sequenced six mitochondrial genes in 115 spectacled bears; a subset of these specimens (n = 61) were genotyped at seven nuclear microsatellites. We addressed three objectives: 1) determine the genetic diversity and historical demographic changes of the spectacled bear in Colombia; 2) determine phylogeographic patterns of genetic divergence among spectacled bear populations in Colombia; and 3) estimate the levels of gene flow among different regions of Colombia. Our analyses show evidence of high mitochondrial genetic diversity in spectacled bears, both in Colombia as well as in each of the nine regions, most particularly Norte de Santander, Narino, and Antioquia-Cordoba. In addition, we detected population expansion in Colombia that occurred around 24,000 years ago, followed by a population decrease during the last 7,000 years, and a sudden expansion in the last 300 years. Phylogenetic analyses showed few well-supported Glades, with some haplotypes detected in all the departments and Colombian Andean Cordilleras, and other haplotypes restricted to certain geographical areas (Antioquia, None de Santander, Cundinamarca, and Narino). We detected significant genetic heterogeneity among some departments and among the three Colombian Andean Cordilleras for both mitochondrial and nuclear genes. Nevertheless, the moderate levels of gene flow estimated from F-ST. statistics suggest that geographical barriers have not been definitive obstacles to the dispersion of the spectacled bear throughout Colombia. Despite these gene flow estimates, significant spatial autocorrelation was detected for spectacled bear in Colombia, where two kinds of spatial patterns were discovered: genetic patches of 144 km of diameter, and isolation by distance among bears separated from 578 to 800 km. The two most northern spectacled bear populations of Colombia (Norte de Santander and Antioquia) also were the two most differentiated.

Nevertheless, several barriers preclude the development of a systematic ""ConnEEGtome"" in dementia research. Here we review critical sources of variability in EEG connectivity studies, and provide general guidelines for multicentric protocol harmonization. We describe how results can be impacted by the choice for data acquisition, and signal processing workflows. The implementation of a particular processing pipeline is conditional upon assumptions made by researchers about the nature of EEG. Due to these assumptions, EEG connectivity metrics are typically applicable to restricted scenarios, e.g., to a particular neurocognitive disorder. ""Ground truths"" for the choice of processing workflow and connectivity analysis are impractical. Consequently, efforts should be directed to harmonizing experimental procedures, data acquisition, and the first steps of the preprocessing pipeline. Conducting multiple analyses of the same data and a proper integration of the results need to be considered in additional processing steps. Furthermore, instead of using a single connectivity measure, using a composite metric combining different connectivity measures brings a powerful strategy to scale up the replicability of multicentric EEG connectivity studies. These composite metrics can boost the predictive strength of diagnostic tools for dementia. Moreover, the implementation of multi-feature machine learning classification systems that include EEG-based connectivity analyses may help to exploit the potential of multicentric studies combining clinical-cognitive, molecular, genetics, and neuroimaging data towards a multi-dimensional characterization of the dementia.",Article,"Prado, P.; Birba, A.; Cruzat, J.; Santamaria-Garcia, H.; Parra, M.; Moguilner, S.; Tagliazucchi, E.; Ibanez, A.",EEG; Connectivity; Dementia; Harmonization; Machine learning; Multicentric studies,EEG;Connectivity;Dementia;Harmonization;Machine learning;Multicentric studies;HUMAN CONNECTOME PROJECT;RESTING-STATE EEG;ALZHEIMERS-DISEASE;FUNCTIONAL CONNECTIVITY;BRAIN CONNECTIVITY;LATIN-AMERICA;GRAPH-THEORY;BIOMARKERS;DYNAMICS;PATTERNS,Chile;Argentina;Colombia;United Kingdom;United States;Ireland,2-s2.0-85122089105;2-s2.0-85122089105;2-s2.0-85122089105;2-s2.0-85122089105;2-s2.0-85122089105;2-s2.0-85122089105

Many natural ecosystems, especially wetlands, have been modified or destroyed due to conversion to rice fields. However, rice crops require flooding, and the wetlands thus created can provide food for several organisms including shorebirds. In the organic rice fields of Valle del Cauca, in Colombia, twelve species of Nearctic migrant shorebirds have been recorded, including the highest numbers of Least Sandpipers (Calidris minutilla) in Colombia. On their breeding grounds in North America, Least Sandpipers feed on benthic and terrestrial invertebrates, while on the wintering grounds they ingest a wider range of prey. To determine the diet of Least Sandpipers in this type of cultivation in Valle del Cauca, from October 2012 to December 2012 we caught 50 individuals using mist netting and obtained regurgitates induced with saline solution. The identification of prey found in regurgitates indicates that Least Sandpipers feed on insects, spiders, and vegetable material in the study site. In addition, they use small stones to crush prey with hard exoskeleton, such as Coleoptera and Hemiptera. Given the relatively high levels of consumption of beetle larvae and adults, which are considered pests for rice crops, Least Sandpipers could be one of the main bio-control agents of these insects. This information contributes to understand why Least Sandpipers use organic rice fields and highlights the importance of this agroecosystem for the migration of this shorebird.",Article,"Cifuentes-Sarmiento, Y.; Renjifo, L.M.",Agroecosystem; Colombia; Diet; Regurgitation; Ricefield; Shorebirds,Agroecosystem;Colombia;Diet;Regurgitation;Ricefield;Shorebirds;MIGRANT SHOREBIRDS;SPRING MIGRATION;FORAGING ECOLOGY;FEEDING ECOLOGY;FOOD-HABITS;WATERBIRDS;DYNAMICS;PATTERNS;CAMARGUE;WETLANDS,Colombia,2-s2.0-84992220816

The disease manifests itself through different disorders, where vasculopathy shows a chronic relationship with diabetic ulceration events in distal extremities, being temperature a biomarker that can quantify the risk scale. According to the above, an analysis is performed with standing thermography images, finding temperature patterns that do not follow a particular distribution in patients with DM. Therefore, the modern medical literature has taken the use of Computer-Aided Diagnosis (CAD) systems as a plausible option to increase medical analysis capabilities. In this sense, we proposed to study three state-of-the-art deep learning (DL) architectures, experimenting with convolutional, residual, and attention (Transformers) approaches to classify subjects with DM from diabetic foot thermography images. The models were trained under three conditions of data augmentation. A novel method based on modifying the images through the change of the amplitude in the Fourier Transform is proposed, being the first work to perform such synergy in the characterization of risk in ulcers through thermographies. The results show that the proposed method allowed reaching the highest values, reaching a perfect classification through the convolutional neural network ResNet50v2, promising for limited data sets in thermal pattern classification problems.(c) 2022 The Author(s).

In those few studies investigating associations between infant nutrition and attachment, nutrition was defined solely by physical growth, and infants had moderate-severe growth retardation. In this study, we utilized multiple markers of infant nutrition. Our sample consisted of 172 12-month-old Peruvian infants and their mothers from low-income families, with a follow-up assessment on 77 infants at 18 months. Infants were not severely malnourished, but did have micronutrient deficiencies. Anthropometry, dietary intake, and iron status were used as measures of infant nutrition. Based on infant behavior in a structured laboratory situation, Q-sort techniques were used to rate three attachment markers: infant secure base behavior, interaction quality, and negative emotionality with mother. At 12 months, infant weight was positively related to interaction quality. At 18 months, infant iron status was positively related to secure base behavior. This pattern of findings remained even after statistically controlling for family socioeconomic status and maternal education. Our findings indicate that infant nutritional status is associated with markers of infant attachment and these associations are not restricted just to severely malnourished infants.",Article,"Wachs, T.D.; Posada, G.; Carbonell, O.A.; Creed-Kanashiro, H.; Gurkas, P.",,MOTHER-CHILD INTERACTION;IRON-DEFICIENCY;ATTACHMENT SECURITY;Q-SORT;PATTERNS;ANEMIA,United States;Colombia,2-s2.0-78650081258;2-s2.0-78650081258

Fractal and multifractal analyses based on power spectrum, Hurst exponent computation, hierarchical power law detection and multifractal spectrum are considered ways to characterize and quantify the footprint of complexity of criminal activity. Moreover, observed chaos analysis is considered a second step to pinpoint the nature of the underlying crime dynamics. This approach is carried out on a long database of burglary activity reported by 10 police districts of San Francisco city. In general, interarrival time processes of criminal activity in San Francisco exhibit fractal and multifractal patterns. The behavior of some of these processes is close to 1/f noise. Therefore, a characterization as deterministic, high-dimensional, chaotic phenomena is viable. Thus, the nature of crime dynamics can be studied from geometric and chaotic perspectives.

Objective: To analyze different genetic abnormalities in acute B lymphoblastic leukemia in children, its relationship with the immunophenotype and the proliferative rate compared with normal B cell precursors. Materials and methods: We assessed immunophenotype, DNA content and proliferative rate in 44 samples by flow cytometry, and translocations t(9; 22), t(12; 21), t(4; 11), and t(1; 19) by RT-PCR. Using a hierarchical cluster analysis, we identified some immunophenotypic patterns associated to genetic abnormalities when compared with normal B cell precursors. Results: DNA quantification showed that 21% of the cases had high hyperdiploidy and 47.7% has low hyperdiploidy. The presence of hyperdiploidy was associated with increased tumor proliferation and aberrant immunophenotypes, including abnormal expression of CD10, TdT, CD38, and CD45 and an increased size of the lymphoblasts.

This relationship was first proposed more than 50 years ago. Mycorrhizal symbiosis in tropical crops is affected by agricultural management practices. This study aimed to assess the occurrence of arbuscular mycorrhizal fungi in leaf litter from three shaded Colombian coffee agroecosystems under organic and conventional management. One is managed chemically, one organically, and one with a combined use of organic and chemical inputs. Leaf litter and roots were collected from the three coffee plots at three decomposition stages. Each plot represented a distinct fertilization and tree dominance pattern different from the other two plots. Arbuscular mycorrhizal fungi were found in decomposing leaves. The chemically managed plot showed statistical differences (p<0.05) with respect to the other plots, it had the greatest amounts of arbuscular mycorrhizal fungal root colonization (48.76-70.51 %), litter colonization (36.2-69.91 %), external mycelium length (28.66-48.33 m g(-1)), and spore number (451.27-681.2 spores in 20 g of dry soil). In contrast, conditions on the combined management coffee plot results in smaller means of the variables evaluated. Arbuscular mycorrhizal fungal root colonization and nitrogen content of leaf litter varied among the decomposition stages (p<0.05). Litter quality of different tree species may have influenced colonization of plant matter within each plot. We found evidence of typical structures of arbuscular mycorrhizal fungi within and among decomposing leaf litter and roots growing into the mat litter in tropical agroecosystems.

Two processes currently researched in these areas are Theory of Mind (ToM) and decision-making in PD patients. ToM is the ability to identify mental states (affective or cognitive) in others, and it is a necessary skill for successful communication in social situations. Decision-making is researched in PD patients due to alterations in dopaminergic pathways involved in cortico-striatal circuits. These pathways have been linked to cognitive functions. Both processes (ToM and decision making) could be altered in PD patients after deep brain stimulation (DBS) therapy. Objective: To compare the performance of PD patients (with and without DBS) and healthy controls (HC) in Theory of Mind and decision-making tasks. Methods: We implemented in three groups of patients (PD, n = 4; PD-DBS, n = 5 and HC, n = 5) the Yoni task to identify affective and cognitive features in ToM, and Iowa Gambling Task (IGT) to assess decision-making. Results: There were no differences across the PD groups in ToM, both in the affective and cognitive features. Regarding decision-making (IGT scores), we obtained results consistent with previous findings, with PD patients showing impairments in this process.

Phylogenetic diversity (PD) measures the evolutionary relationship of species using the tree of life. Our knowledge of CWR PD in neotropical regions is in its infancy. We analysed the distribution of CWR PD across Colombia and assessed its conservation status. The areas with the largest concentration of PD were identified as being in the northern part of the central and western Andean mountain ranges and the Pacific region. These centres of high PD were comprised of predominantly short and closely related branches, mostly of species of wild tomatoes and black peppers. In contrast, the CWR PD in the lowland ecosystems of the Amazon and Orinoquia regions had deeply diverging clades predominantly represented by long and distantly related branches (i.e. tuberous roots, grains and cacao). We categorized 50 (52.6%) of the CWR species as 'high priority', 36 as 'medium priority' and nine as 'low priority' for further ex-situ and in situ conservation actions. New areas of high PD and richness with large ex-situ gap collections were identified mainly in the northern part of the Andes of Colombia.

We evaluated ecological restoration of three corridors between two protected Andean forests. Soil ants and eight environmental variables focused on edaphic conditions were monitored for 8 years following restoration activity. Soil ants were collected in pitfall traps and by leaf litter extraction on 21 plots classified into five types of habitat: large forest patches, riparian forests, two types of restoration corridors on former timber and pasture land (R-Forestry and R-Pasture, respectively), and Pasture. A total of 132 ant species belonging to 40 genera were found. Among these, 112 species were found in Forests, 105 in Riparian, 80 in R-Forestry, 79 in R-Pasture and 63 in Pasture. Composition analyses (canonical correspondence analysis and NMDS) showed that the ant community in restoration corridors and pastures is far from resembling that of the forests. Yet, there is biological progress with respect to the Pasture.

Thus, 20% adults will develop metabolic syndrome (MS) along their lifespan within a tremendous effect their lives. Objective: To identify social, biological and behavioral factors associated with MS in adults. Materials and methods: 300 cases, 675 controls were included. Cases had waist circumference (abdominal obesity) >= 94cm/men and >= 88cm/women, plus other two factors including hypertension, high glycated hemoglobin, high triglycerides, and low HDL levels. Controls presented one or none one of previously cited risk factors. Results: Whole MS prevalence was 30.2%, being in females 33.6%, and 25.6% in males. Therefore, females had a higher risk for developing MS, OR = 1.70 95%CI (1.17-2.47). Ethnicity ""mestizo"" also increased the risk of having MS, OR =1.55 (1.10-2.19). In contrast, frequent fruit consumption and being housekeeper were protective factors, OR 0.83 (0.69 - 1.00), OR 0.58 (0.36-0.92), respectively. Logistic regression showed that obesity is the strongest associated MS risk factor, OR = 7.52 (4.79-11.80). Increasing age yield alinear trend with SM. Thus, age range from 40 to 49 years old, yield OR = 4.24 (2.20-8.16), 50 to 59 years old, OR = 4.63 (2.40-8.93) and those older than 80 years, OR = 5.32(1.92-14.71).

Review of the literature,"OBJECTIVE: Testicular cancer (TC) is the most common cancer in men between 15 and 44 years. It has been reported that the incidence of TC is rising. The aim of this article is to determine the epidemiology of TC in Colombia. METHODS: A literature review on four databases was performed PubMed, Embase, Lilacs and Scielo. Studies of incidence, prevalence, mortality and survival of TC were taken from different countries. Studies included were published in the last 10 years. RESULTS: 2308 references were reviewed by title and abstract. In search of local references in non-indexedjournals 5 references were extracted. In total 139 references for review in full text were selected. The global incidence and prevalence of cancer varies. In the Northern Europe region, the highest incidence is evident, mainly in Denmark, Croatia and Norway. Followed by Western Europe and South America with Chile. In Colombia the general age incidence is 2,2/100.000, finding a zero incidence in departments such as Choco and Guajira. CONCLUSIONS: A rise in the incidence of TC has been seen globally, this trend mainly in developing countries. In Colombia most studies are crossectional studies. By seeing the epidemiological data from some departments and the lack of specialists in those regions, it can be deduced the existence of an underreport of the disease that reveals the heed to improve both surveillance systems and information registration, such as policies to achieve early diagnosis of TC.",Article,"Medina-Rico, M.; Lopez-Ramos, H.",Testicular cancer; Epidemiology; Incidence; Mortality; Survival rate,Testicular cancer;Epidemiology;Incidence;Mortality;Survival rate;GERM-CELL TUMORS;UNITED-STATES;UROGENITAL CANCER;YOUNG-ADULTS;LIFE LOST;TRENDS;SURVIVAL;PATTERNS;SUBTYPE,Colombia,2-s2.0-85020206602

Leaf modification involves energetic and defense costs that should be balanced by the benefits of tent-roosting. The alteration of the leaf's vascular system reduces the tent's life expectancy, so to obtain a benefit, bats are expected to use tents regularly as long as they remain functional and not modify more leaves than necessary. Over 2 yr, we documented the dynamics of tent construction and use by Uroderma convexum and other bat species in the palm Sabal mauritiiformis in a Colombian transitional dry forest. We also assessed tent condition and compared it to nonmodified leaves of approximately the same age in focal palms. Probability of tent use by U.convexum varied between 57 percent during a reproductive period and 4 percent outside of this period. Bats cut the main vein of folioles, partially affecting water transport in the leaf. However, there were no differences between tents and nonmodified leaves in deterioration scores or deterioration rates over 1 yr. During 2 yr, 48 tents were lost for different causes, but this loss was balanced by the construction of 51 new tents. Thus, bats maintained an excess of usable tents. Palm leaves are long-lived and seem preadapted to sustain damage and remain viable, particularly in species growing in dry environments.

In South America, the livestock industry is heavily impacting the environment, but also delivers important socioeconomic benefits to rural populations. Recently, there has been strong debate on how to define land suitability for cattle grazing and priority areas for intensified production, limited production, or conservation. We present a conceptual framework that evaluates land use performance in terms of productivity and environmental impacts, and apply this framework using a spatially explicit approach and multi-criteria analysis for cattle grazing systems in Colombia. Our study provides a national perspective of the current land use situation for the cattle sector, and defines areas where cattle grazing should be promoted, restricted, or excluded. Results indicate that up to 42% of the total area under cattle grazing land use show important biophysical constraints that limit their suitability. Furthermore, our productivity analysis indicates that 60% of national rangeland has low stocking rates (<0.5 AU ha(-1)), and only 13% of rangeland has high stocking rates (>1 AU ha(-1)). Current grazing areas that should be excluded, according to biophysical limitations and low productivity, are mostly concentrated in the Andean, Caribbean and Pacific regions, while grazing areas identified for restricted production are mainly located in the Andean and Caribbean Regions. This study provides the first spatially explicit, multi-criteria analysis of land suitability for cattle grazing systems at national level, which can be used to inform improved land planning and management at regional and municipal levels.",Article,"Zuluaga, A.; Etter, A.; Nepstad, D.; Chara, J.; Stickler, C.; Warren, M.",,CLIMATE-CHANGE MITIGATION;LAND-COVER CHANGE;BIODIVERSITY CONSERVATION;COMMODITY PRODUCTION;ECOSYSTEM SERVICES;PATTERNS;DRIVERS;AMAZON;BEEF;INTENSIFICATION,Colombia;United States,2-s2.0-85111266212;2-s2.0-85111266212;2-s2.0-85111266212

Between 2016-2017 we evaluated the structure and density of populations in six localities of the Magdalena river valley, and studied the population dynamic in the locality of Guaduas, Cundinamarca (VC). Although the population structure differs among locations (X-2 = 1819; gl = 25; P < 0.05), populations tend to group according to the degree of habitat perturbation. In four localities an inverted J population structure was observed. A matrix population model showed a finite growth rate (lambda) of 0.979 (CI95 % = 0.962-0.997). The demographic processes of the permanence of seedlings, sub-adults and young adults show more elasticity. A transient dynamic simulation projected to 30 years shows that under the scenarios of paddock and cattle lopping the population size decrease drastically. The extinction threshold calculated for the population in the locality VC is of 145 years, but paddock and cattle lopping activities can reduce it to less than 40 years. Although Attalea nucifera persists in very disturbing locations in the Middle Magdalena Basin, the results of population dynamics in the locality VC suggest that it could be less tolerant of environmental disturbances.

Brood-parasitic cowbirds (Molothrus spp.) exhibit a unique pattern of changing social behavior on a daily cycle. Female Brown-headed Cowbirds (M. ater) in North America spend the morning accompanied by males searching for host nests, and in the afternoon both sexes join feeding flocks. We studied flocking patterns of Shiny Cowbirds (M. bonariensis) in open-habitat animal exhibits at a zoo in Colombia. Flock sizes of both males and females were low in the morning but increased towards noon. Male abundance remained high during the afternoon, but female abundance was very variable. Numbers of juveniles did not change throughout the day. This is consistent with the idea that cowbirds are spread out during the morning in the breeding areas and aggregate in the afternoon to feed.

To identify the pivotal developmental stages at which floral variation may originate and to infer the putative associated genetic causes, we studied abnormal flowers in nine cultivars of Aquilegia and Delphinium of Ranunculaceae, a family displaying a high range of floral diversity. Wild-type flowers of the two genera are pentamerous and spurred, but they differ in their overall symmetry (actinomorphy vs. zygomorphy). Floral morphology of their cultivars at different developmental stages up to anthesis was observed, and the putative identity of the perianth organs and vascularization was inferred. Our results show that in the floral mutants in both genera, phyllotaxis was generally conserved, whereas floral organization, vascularization and symmetry were modified. Most of the morphological and anatomical deviations impacted the perianth, including organ number, identity and (spur) elaboration, and also led to the formation of mosaic organs. We hypothesized that the phenotypes of floral mutants in Aquilegia and Delphinium result from genetic alterations affecting frontiers between sets of organs of different identity, homeosis and length of floral meristem activity.",Article,"Espinosa, F.; Damerval, C.; Le Guilloux, M.; Deroin, T.; Wang, W.; Pinedo-Castro, M.; Nadot, S.; Jabbour, F.",development; organ identity; perianth; spurs; supernumerary organs,development;organ identity;perianth;spurs;supernumerary organs;MADS BOX GENES;PETAL IDENTITY;NEW-MODEL;EVOLUTION;APETALA3;DIVERSIFICATION;PATTERNS;TERATA,France;China;Colombia,2-s2.0-85104713278

Data from 9218 participants from Argentina, Brazil, Chile, Colombia, Costa Rica, Ecuador, Peru, and Venezuela participating in ""Latin American Health and Nutrition Study (ELANS)"", a multi-country, population-based study, were used. Dietary intake was collected through two, 24 h recalls. Participants were classified into consumers (n = 1073) and non-alcohol consumers (n = 8145) using a cut-off criterium of >= 15 g/day of alcohol consumption calculated from the estimation of their usual daily intake. Among alcohol consumers, the mean alcohol consumption was 69.22 +/- 2.18 grams (4.6. beverages/day), contributing to 484.62 kcal, which corresponded to 16.86% of the total energy intake. We found that the risk of alcohol consumption was higher in young and middle-aged men from low and middle socioeconomic status. Argentine, Brazil, and Chile had the highest percentage of consumers, while Ecuador showed the highest alcohol consumption. Alcohol drinkers were characterized by having higher body weight and wider neck, waist, hips circumferences. Alcohol drinkers had a higher energy intake, with macronutrients providing relatively less energy at the expense of the energy derived from alcohol. Alcohol drinkers showed lower and higher consumptions of healthy and unhealthy food groups, respectively. In addition, adequacy ratios for all micronutrients assessed were lower in alcohol consumers.

However, the covariation of the rostral and caudal modules within adaptive zones, where specializations may impose constraints on morphological diversification, remains unknown. Here we used phylogenetic linear models and accounted for phylogenetic uncertainty to examine the evolutionary relationship between brain volume-as a proxy for neurocranium size-and palate morphology in 42 species of specialized frugivores of the subfamily Stenodermatinae. We found that the palate surface area increased and became relatively wider as brain size increased. This pattern may be pervasive in frugivorous phyllostomids, although different lineages may show different rates of covariation.

This neuropathic pain has been associated with a high risk of anxiety in patients with it, thus generating a more significant economic burden in patients with symptomatic diabetic neuropathy. Aim: To describe current literature on the relationship between symptomatic diabetic Neuropathy and the risk of concomitant anxiety symptoms. Method: We carried out a similar search by four reviewers in the Ovid, Pubmed, SciELO, and Cochrane databases. Results: Of the 1140 articles found, 56 were evaluated in full text. A varied prevalence of anxious and depressive symptoms was found in patients with symptomatic diabetic neuropathy, evaluated using different questionnaires and scales. Some studies found an association between anxiety symptoms, sleep disorders, and inadequate glycemic control. Early education and the management of neuropathic pain have been reported as factors of good prognosis, the latter being the determinants of quality of life and productivity in patients with symptomatic diabetic neuropathy.

Objectives Quantify the differential use of habitat that Amazon River dolphins exhibit and identify core areas of activity during seasons of rising waters in the Colombian Amazonas River and five major rivers in the Orinoco basin. Methods Based on processed satellite images from Landsat 8 (2018-2021), we classified habitat types used by I. geoffrensis as reported in the literature as follows: (1) main river, (2) confluences, (3) tributaries, (4) channels, (5) islands, (6) bays, and (7) lagoons. We combined this dataset with GPS location data obtained from 17 tagged Amazon River dolphins to quantify the proportion of habitat types used. We used kernel density estimate (KDE) analysis to identify both areas used (K-95) and core areas (K-50) in the habitat types for the satellite-monitored individuals.

Methods: A retrospective descriptive study was conducted from January 2014 to August 2015; 10.110 mammograms of patients aged over 50 years were reviewed. Subsequently, a review of the literature in the main databases was made. Results: From 10.110 mammograms that were performed, 4.448 were found to be positive for dense breast tissue. 39,69% had heterogeneously dense breast tissue, and 4,29% extremely dense breast tissue, for a total result of 43,9% patients with positive dense breast tissue. Conclusion: Breast density is an independent risk factor for breast cancer, being of medium importance compared with other factors. As the breast density increases, the overlap of the radiopaque breast tissue that can hide and delay the diagnosis of an underlying cancer is generated. The high prevalence of dense breast tissue that we found in this population suggests the need of complementing screening with other imaging methods.",Article,"Baquero-Serrano, A.; Lopez-Martinez, L.; Vera-Campos, S.; Rosales-Rueda, S.; Jaramillo-Boterode, N.; Ochoa-Vera, M.",Mammography; Breast; Diagnosis; Mass Screening,Mammography;Breast;Diagnosis;Mass Screening;UNITED-STATES;CANCER RISK;TOMOSYNTHESIS;LEGISLATION;PATTERNS,Colombia,

Because of the COVID-19 pandemic, the implementation of political actions to promote a healthy diet and reduce the consumption of ultra-processed foods is a priority, not only to prevent non-communicable diseases (NCDs), but also to reduce the clinical impairment of the persons who suffer them. The political actions that ensure the supply of unprocessed foods of high nutritional value to the markets in a periodic and timely manner and that allow the farmers to continue with their cultivation and harvest activities are a fundamental pillar to mitigate the effects of indirect health negatives derived from the pandemic.

Typically, median or mean FoI estimates are used as the response variable in predictive models, often overlooking the uncertainty in estimated FoI values when fitting models and evaluating their predictive ability. To assess how this uncertainty impact predictions, we compared three approaches with three levels of uncertainty integration. We propose a performance indicator to assess how predictions reflect initial uncertainty. In Colombia, 76 serosurveys (1980-2014) conducted at municipality level provided age-stratified Chagas disease prevalence data. The yearly FoI was estimated at the serosurvey level using a time-varying catalytic model. Environmental, demographic and entomological predictors were used to fit and predict the FoI at municipality level from 1980 to 2010 across Colombia. A stratified bootstrap method was used to fit the models without temporal autocorrelation at the serosurvey level. The predictive ability of each model was evaluated to select the best-fit models within urban, rural and (Amerindian) indigenous settings. Model averaging, with the 10 best-fit models identified, was used to generate predictions. Our analysis shows a risk of overconfidence in model predictions when median estimates of FoI alone are used to fit and evaluate models, failing to account for uncertainty in FoI estimates. Our proposed methodology fully propagates uncertainty in the estimated FoI onto the generated predictions, providing realistic assessments of both central tendency and current uncertainty surrounding exposure to Chagas disease.",Article,"Ledien, J.; Cucunuba, Z.M.; Parra-Henao, G.; Rodriguez-Mongui, E.; Dobson, A.P.; Basanez, M.G.; Nouvellet, P.",Force of infection; Model averaging; Chagas disease; Infectious disease; Modelling,Force of infection;Model averaging;Chagas disease;Infectious disease;Modelling;EVOLUTION;PATTERNS;ECOLOGY;BURDEN,United Kingdom;Colombia;United States,2-s2.0-85122999644;2-s2.0-85122999644

Understanding the topology of bat-flower networks is fundamental to understand ecosystem functions. However, this mutualism has rarely been studied on a community-wide level. We applied network theory to analyze the bat-flower interactions in the Americas. We addressed three questions: what is the state of knowledge of the diet of nectarivorous phyllostomid bats? Are bat-flower interaction networks random or structured? Are specialized nectarivorous bats more central than facultative bats? We compiled information on bat-flower interactions in the Americas and built four matrices (Americas, South, Central-North, and Antilles). We calculated complementary specialization, nestedness, and quantitative modularity; and we assessed the functional role of bat and plant genera using two centrality metrics. We found 61 phyllostomid bat species that visited 277 flowering plant species. The most important bats were Glossophaga soricina, Leptonycteris yerbabuenae and Anoura geoffroyi. The most important plant species were Ceiba pentandra, Cordia alliodora and Pseudobombax ellipticum. Most networks were specialized, modular, and non-nested; however, in the Antilles the networks were nested, unspecialized, and not modular. The specialist bat genera Glossophaga and Anoura were the genera most central as hubs, and the facultative genera Phyllostomus and Artibeus were connectors. The plant genera Ceiba, Pseudobombax, Ochroma and Pilosocereus were central as connector hubs. Nectarivorous specialist bats demonstrate more interactions, maintaining the entire system; meanwhile facultative bats were connectors, binding different parts of the network.

Rainfall causes rivers to swell, increasing water velocity, turbulence, and turbidity. These changes may affect the ducks' foraging ability because of the harsher conditions or alteration of the aquatic macroinvertebrate resource base. We examined the relationship of Torrent Duck time budgets with food availability and rainfall in the central Andes of Colombia. Time spent foraging was not correlated with total macroinvertebrate density but was negatively correlated with density of 4 preferred families. Monthly precipitation was negatively correlated with total macroinvertebrate density but not correlated with the 4 preferred families. Time spent foraging correlated with rainfall the day before. Torrent Duck time budgets result from interactions among several factors: the ducks' foraging tactics, prey type, and river conditions that affect ducks directly, and indirectly through prey availability. Three of the 4 preferred invertebrate families are filter-feeding larvae that adhere to rocks and are therefore less affected by changes in river flow than other prey types. Thus, Torrent Duck foraging time is independent of overall invertebrate abundance but responds strongly to changes in the density of the 4 most-consumed families. Foraging time is also affected by previous-day rainfall, suggesting that increases in water flow or turbidity have a direct effect on the ducks' foraging efficiency. We conclude that physical conditions of the river habitat impose restrictions on the ducks' activities, both directly and through an indirect interaction with food availability.",Article,"Cardona, W.; Kattan, G.H.",Anatidae; Andean river; aquatic macroinvertebrate; foraging behavior; Colombia,Anatidae;Andean river;aquatic macroinvertebrate;foraging behavior;Colombia;RESPONSES;SELECTION;PATTERNS;RIVER,Colombia,2-s2.0-85069196370;2-s2.0-85069196370

This acidic spring had a diverse community composed mainly of Bacteria that shared characteristics with those from other hot springs and extreme acidic environments. The microbial community was dominated by Proteobacteria, Firmicutes, and Planctomycetes and contained chemotrophic bacteria potentially involved in cycling of ferrous and sulfur-containing minerals and phototrophic organisms, most of which were eukaryotic micro-algae. Despite the presence of a large proportion of novel, unclassified sequences, the taxonomic profiles obtained with each strategy showed similarities at higher taxonomic levels. However, some groups, such as Spirochaetes and Aquificae, were identified using only one methodology, and more taxa were detected with the gene array, which also shared more groups with the pyrosequencing data.

Nineteen Chilean and thirteen Colombian sediment samples were analyzed in order to determine their content of brorninated flame retardants (BFRs) (including PBDEs and emerging BFRs) as well as UV filters (UV-F). Samples were collected from neighboring aquatic ecosystems highly urbanized and industrialized in Colombia (Magdalena River area) and Chile (Biobio region). Different analytical procedures were applied depending on the selected analytes, based on chromatographic and mass spectrometric methodologies (GC-MS and LC-MS-MS). In general, concentration levels of both BFRs (up to 2.43 and 143 ng g(-1)dw of PBDEs in Chile and Colombia, respectively) and UV-F (nd-2.96 and nd-54.4 ng g(-1) dw in Chile and Colombia, respectively) were in the low range of published data, and the contribution of BFRs was higher than that of UV-F for almost all the sampled sediments.

The global incidence is increasing, and Latin America is no exception. This article reviews MRSA clonal distribution in Latin America and implications for clinical practice. Design: A PubMed literature search (1966-2008) identified 32 articles that characterized MRSA clones in Latin America. Results: Data from these articles show that since 1990, several epidemic MRSA clones have spread in Latin America. The multidrug-resistant Brazilian clone is widespread, especially in Brazil and Argentina, but more recently clones with susceptibility to a range of antibiotics have been detected in Brazil, whereas in Argentina, as in Chile, Colombia and Paraguay, the multidrug-resistant Cordobes/Chilean clone prevails. In Mexico, the New York/Japan clone is most frequent. Data were not available from every country and, despite the increasing prevalence of community MRSA infections, most were collected from tertiary care centers. Conclusions: A variety of epidemic MRSA clones are circulating in Latin America, some of which harbor genes that encode multidrug resistance or enhanced pathogenicity. Continued collection and reporting of epidemiological data is crucial for effective prevention and treatment. (C) 2009 International Society for Infectious Diseases. Published by Elsevier Ltd.

Motivated by the observation that the set of interface residues of a protein tend to be conserved even among remote structural homologs, we introduce PrISE, a family of local structural similarity-based computational methods for predicting protein-protein interface residues. Results: We present a novel representation of the surface residues of a protein in the form of structural elements. Each structural element consists of a central residue and its surface neighbors. The PrISE family of interface prediction methods uses a representation of structural elements that captures the atomic composition and accessible surface area of the residues that make up each structural element. Each of the members of the PrISE methods identifies for each structural element in the query protein, a collection of similar structural elements in its repository of structural elements and weights them according to their similarity with the structural element of the query protein. PrISEL relies on the similarity between structural elements (i.e. local structural similarity). PrISEG relies on the similarity between protein surfaces (i.e. general structural similarity). PrISEC, combines local structural similarity and general structural similarity to predict interface residues. These predictors label the central residue of a structural element in a query protein as an interface residue if a weighted majority of the structural elements that are similar to it are interface residues, and as a non-interface residue otherwise. The results of our experiments using three representative benchmark datasets show that the PrISEC outperforms PrISEL and PrISEG; and that PrISEC is highly competitive with state-of-the-art structure-based methods for predicting protein-protein interface residues. Our comparison of PrISEC with PredUs, a recently developed method for predicting interface residues of a query protein based on the known interface residues of its (global) structural homologs, shows that performance superior or comparable to that of PredUs can be obtained using only local surface structural similarity.

Some of these symbionts have been used as probiotics to treat or prevent the emerging disease chytridiomycosis. We examined 20 amphibian cutaneous bacteria for the production of prodigiosin or violacein, brightly colored defense compounds that pigment the bacteria and have characteristic spectroscopic properties making them readily detectable, and evaluated the antifungal activity of these compounds. We detected violacein from all six isolates of Janthinobacterium lividum on frogs from the USA, Switzerland, and on captive frogs originally from Panama. We detected prodigiosin from five isolates of Serratia plymuthica or S. marcescens, but not from four isolates of S. fonticola or S. liquefaciens. All J. lividum isolates produced violacein when visibly purple, while prodigiosin was only detected on visibly red Serratia isolates. When applied to cultures of chytrid fungi Batrachochytrium dendrobatidis (Bd) and B. salamandrivorans (Bsal), prodigiosin caused significant growth inhibition, with minimal inhibitory concentrations (MIC) of 10 and 50 mu M, respectively. Violacein showed a MIC of 15 mu M against both fungi and was slightly more active against Bsal than Bd at lower concentrations. Although neither violacein nor prodigiosin showed aerosol activity and is not considered a volatile organic compound (VOC), J. lividum and several Serratia isolates did produce antifungal VOCs. White Serratia isolates with undetectable prodigiosin levels could still inhibit Bd growth indicating additional antifungal compounds in their chemical arsenals. Similarly, J. lividum can produce antifungal compounds such as indole-3-carboxaldehyde in addition to violacein, and isolates are not always purple, or turn purple under certain growth conditions. When Serratia isolates were grown in the presence of cell-free supernatant (CFS) from the fungi, CFS from Bd inhibited growth of the prodigiosin-producing isolates, perhaps indicative of an evolutionary arms race; Bsal CFS did not inhibit bacterial growth. In contrast, growth of one J. lividum isolate was facilitated by CFS from both fungi. Isolates that grow and continue to produce antifungal compounds in the presence of pathogens may represent promising probiotics for amphibians infected or at risk of chytridiomycosis. In a global analysis, 89% of tested Serratia isolates and 82% of J. lividum isolates were capable of inhibiting Bd and these have been reported from anurans and caudates from five continents, indicating their widespread distribution and potential for host benefit.",Article,"Woodhams, D.C.; LaBumbard, B.C.; Barnhart, K.L.; Becker, M.H.; Bletz, M.C.; Escobar, L.A.; Flechas, S.V.; Forman, M.E.; Iannetta, A.A.; Joyce, M.D.; Rabemananjara, F.; Gratwicke, B.; Vences, M.; Minbiole, K.P.C.",Skin microbiota; Amphibian; Disease ecology; Chytridiomycosis; Secondary metabolites; Antifungal,Skin microbiota;Amphibian;Disease ecology;Chytridiomycosis;Secondary metabolites;Antifungal;MARINE BACTERIUM;JANTHINOBACTERIUM-LIVIDUM;NATURAL-PRODUCTS;LIFE STAGES;SP-NOV.;RED;SALAMANDER;CYCLOPRODIGIOSIN;IDENTIFICATION;METABOLITES,United States;Germany;Colombia;Madagascar,2-s2.0-85033406299;2-s2.0-85033406299

Interactions between the microalga and each of the bacterial species were followed using transmission electron microscopy for 10 days. Initially, most of the small cavities within the beads were colonized by microcolonies of only one microorganism, regardless of the bacterial species cocultured with the microalga. Subsequently, the bacterial and microalgal microcolonies merged to form large, mixed colonies within the cavities. At this stage, the effect of bacterial association with the microalga differed depending on the bacterium present. Though the microalga entered a senescence phase in the presence of P. myrsinacearum, it remained in a growth phase in the presence of A. brasilense.

In chronic viral infections, this cell subset has effector memory phenotype and displays antigen specificity. No previous studies of double positive T cells in parasite infections have been carried out. Methodology/Principal Findings: Seventeen chronic chagasic patients (7 asymptomatic and 10 symptomatic) and 24 noninfected donors, including 12 healthy and 12 with non-chagasic cardiomyopathy donors were analyzed. Peripheral blood was stained for CD3, CD4, CD8, HLA-DR and CD38, and lymphocytes for intracellular perforin. Antigen specificity was assessed using HLA*A2 tetramers loaded with T. cruzi K1 or influenza virus epitopes. Surface expression of CD107 and intracellular IFN-gamma production were determined in K1-specific DP T cells from 11 chagasic donors. Heart tissue from a chronic chagasic patient was stained for both CD8 and CD4 by immunochemistry. Chagasic patients showed higher frequencies of DP T cells (2.1%+/- 0.9) compared with healthy (1.1%+/- 0.5) and non-chagasic cardiomyopathy (1.2%+/- 0.4) donors. DP T cells from Chagasic patients also expressed more HLA-DR, CD38 and perforin and had higher frequencies of T. cruzi K1-specific cells. IFN-gamma production in K1-specific cells was higher in asymptomatic patients after polyclonal stimulation, while these cells tended to degranulate more in symptomatic donors. Immunochemistry revealed that double positive T cells infiltrate the cardiac tissue of a chagasic donor. Conclusions: Chagasic patients have higher percentages of circulating double positive T cells expressing activation markers, potential effector molecules and greater class I antigenic specificity against T. cruzi.

The K1 peptide derived from T. cruzi KMP-11 protein has a high binding affinity to the HLA-A*0201 molecule. Nevertheless, it is not known whether this peptide is processed and displayed as an MHC class I epitope during natural infection by T. cruzi. The aim of this study was to evaluate, by ELISPOT assay, the ability of K1 peptide to activate CD8(+)T lymphocytes to produce IFN-gamma. Therefore, CD8(+)T lymphocytes from 22 HLA-A*0201(+)individuals, 12 chronic chagasic patients and 10 uninfected controls, were analysed. The results revealed that two of the chagasic patients had IFN-gamma-secreting CD8(+)T cells that were able to respond to K1 peptide with a relative frequency of 110 and 230 per million CD8(+)T cells. In contrast, none of HLA-A*0201(+)uninfected controls responded to K1 peptide. Responses to HLA-A*0201 restricted peptide from the influenza matrix protein were found in six chagasic patients and four uninfected controls with an average frequency of 175 and 111 cells per million CD8(+)T cells, respectively. Moreover, a flow cytometric assay for degranulation showed that chagasic responders had K1-specific cytotoxic CD8(+) T cells.

In this article, we provide an updated and comprehensive review of available qPCR-based methods for miRNA expression analysis and discuss their advantages and disadvantages. Existing techniques involve the use of stem-loop reverse transcription-PCR, polyadenylation of RNAs, ligation of adapters or RT with complex primers, using universal or miRNA-specific qPCR primers and/or probes. Many of these methods are oriented towards the expression analysis of mature miRNAs and few are designed for the study of pre-miRNAs and pri-miRNAs. We also discuss findings from articles that compare results from existing methods.

During disaster response operations, the degraded functionality of the system can negatively impact the affected population because disrupting relief activitiesincreases human suffering resulting from the lack of access to essential goods or services. Mathematical formulations for assessing transportation network vulnerability do not generally consider this lack of access or deprivation costs, and can lead to inappropriate strategies for humanitarian assistance. This paper proposes a transportation network vulnerability assessment model that allows identifying critical links for the development of high impact disaster response operations. The model is based on an economic analysis that considers the logistical costs of the distribution operations and the external effects derived from the delays in the provision of basic supplies (deprivation costs). The approach is particularly useful for planning resilient disaster response plans in the preparednessstage, prioritizing investment for mitigation and adaptation, and prioritizing the rehabilitation (access restoration) of the disrupted links in the response and recovery stages. In addition to numerical experiments using case study networks, the authors implemented the model to the coffee-producing region of Colombia, which was hit by an earthquake in 1999.",Article,"Cantillo, V.; Macea, L.F.; Jaller, M.",Vulnerability; Deprivation costs; Social costs; Accessibility; Resilience; Humanitarian logistics,Vulnerability;Deprivation costs;Social costs;Accessibility;Resilience;Humanitarian logistics;ROAD NETWORK;LINKS;ROBUSTNESS;INFRASTRUCTURE;IDENTIFICATION;PERFORMANCE;EXPOSURE;RANKING;DAMAGE,Colombia;United States,2-s2.0-85040680519

The library covered 80 Mb of the metagenomic DNA mainly from Proteobacteria, Actinobacteria and Acidobacteria. Two clones with lipolytic activity in tributyrin as a substrate were recovered. Clone BAA3G2 (pSK-estGX1) was selected and the entire 4.6 Kb insert sequence was determined. The sequence had a GC content of 70.6% and could be derived from an undescribed Actinobacteria genome. One open reading frame encoded a polypeptide of 210 amino acids (gene estGX1) with a molecular mass of 22.4 kDa that contained the pentapeptide G-P-S-G-G near the N-terminus essential for lipase activity and the putative catalytic triad was identified, also a putative ribosomal binding site located 18 bp upstream the estGX1 ATG start codon was identified. The phylogenetic analysis suggested that the protein belonged to a new lipase family. The secreted enzyme showed a preference for short length fatty acids, with specific activity against p-nitrophenyl-butyrate (0.142 U/mg of total protein), it was cold active with relative activity of 30% at 10A degrees C and moderately thermo active with relative activity of 80% at 50A degrees C and had a pH optimum of 8.0 at 40A degrees C.",Article,"Jimenez, D.J.; Montana, J.S.; Alvarez, D.; Baena, S.",Cold active esterase; Forest soil; Functional screening; Metagenomic library,Cold active esterase;Forest soil;Functional screening;Metagenomic library;LIPOLYTIC ENZYMES;LIPASE;IDENTIFICATION;LIBRARY;GENES;HYDROLASE;DATABASE;CLONING;FAMILY;CLASSIFICATION,Colombia,2-s2.0-84655169688

Eye rubbing, and more recently eye compression due to sleeping position, have been identified to be highly related to the condition, and are present in a high percentage of patients. Today, the predominant model is that these factors can provide the ""second hit"" necessary to generate the condition in a genetically susceptible individual. In addition, the extremely high prevalence in Arab populations, where endogamy could play a role, the high concordance rate in monozygotic twins, and the presence of family history of the condition between 5 and 23% of cases, support a genetic influence. Segregation analysis studies suggest that keratoconus is a complex non Mendelian disease. Results from linkage analysis, next generation sequencing studies and genome-wide association studies also have suggested that genetic factors are involved in the condition. Recently, it has been proposed that mechanical trauma (i.e. eye rubbing or eye compression at night), is a sine quanon condition for the onset of keratoconus, and quite possibly its only cause. There are various arguments for and against this hypothesis.

To identify variants in immunosuppressive pathway genes associated with prognosis after adjuvant chemotherapy for ER-negative patients, we studied stage I-III invasive breast cancer patients of European ancestry, including 9,334 ER-positive (3,151 treated with chemotherapy) and 2,334 ER-negative patients (1,499 treated with chemotherapy). Methods: We pooled data from sixteen studies from the Breast Cancer Association Consortium (BCAC), and employed two independent studies for replications. Overall 3,610 single nucleotide polymorphisms (SNPs) in 133 genes were genotyped as part of the Collaborative Oncological Gene-environment Study, in which phenotype and clinical data were collected and harmonized. Multivariable Cox proportional hazard regression was used to assess genetic associations with overall survival (OS) and breast cancer-specific survival (BCSS). Heterogeneity according to chemotherapy or ER status was evaluated with the log-likelihood ratio test. Results: Three independent SNPs in TGFBR2 and IL12B were associated with OS (P < 10(-3)) solely in ER-negative patients after chemotherapy (267 events). Poorer OS associated with TGFBR2 rs1367610 (G > C) (per allele hazard ratio (HR) 1.54 (95% confidence interval (CI) 1.22 to 1.95), P = 3.08 x 10(-4)) was not found in ER-negative patients without chemotherapy or ER-positive patients with chemotherapy (P for interaction < 10-3). Two SNPs in IL12B (r(2) = 0.20) showed different associations with ER-negative disease after chemotherapy: rs2546892 (G > A) with poorer OS (HR 1.50 (95% CI 1.21 to 1.86), P = 1.81 x 10(-4)), and rs2853694 (A > C) with improved OS (HR 0.73 (95% CI 0.61 to 0.87), P = 3.67 x 10(-4)). Similar associations were observed with BCSS. Association with TGFBR2 rs1367610 but not IL12B variants replicated using BCAC Asian samples and the independent Prospective Study of Outcomes in Sporadic versus Hereditary Breast Cancer Study and yielded a combined HR of 1.57 ((95% CI 1.28 to 1.94), P = 2.05 x 10(-5)) without study heterogeneity.

Villeta town has been identified as an endemic area for spotted fever group (SFG) rickettsioses but little is known about possible amplifier hosts and other Rickettsia species different from Rickettsia rickettsii. Besides, few studies have approached other AUFS etiologies in the region. We investigated the role of dengue, leptospirosis, rickettsioses, human anaplasmosis, and Q fever as possible causes of AUFS in patients from Villeta. Sera specimens and ticks from animals as well as ticks from vegetation were studied for the presence of different Rickettsia spp. Among 104 sera from patients with AUFS, 16.4%, 24.0%, and 2.9% patients seroconverted to dengue, Leptospira, and SFG Rickettsia, respectively, with a case of probable coinfection or cross-reaction with Anaplasma phagocytophilum. None of the samples were reactive for Coxiella burnetii. Sera samples from 74 horses, 118 dogs, and 62 bovines were collected and showed 33.8%, 14.4%, and 50.0% of seroprevalence for SFG Rickettsia, respectively. A total of 1,287 ixodid ticks were collected from animals/vegetation and processed in pools for polymerase chain reaction. Among them, 1.7% was positive for Rickettsia genes, and Rickettsia amblyommii, R. rickettsii, and Rickettsia spp. were found.

The objective is to report the results of a systematic review concerning approaches aimed at identifying sections in narrative content of EHR, using both automatic or semi-automatic methods. Methods: This review includes articles from the databases: SCOPUS, Web of Science and PubMed (from January 1994 to September 2018). The selection of studies was done using predefined eligibility criteria and applying the PRISMA recommendations. Search criteria were elaborated by using an iterative and collaborative keyword enrichment. Results: Following the eligibility criteria, 39 studies were selected for analysis. The section identification approaches proposed by these studies vary greatly depending on the kind of narrative, the type of section, and the application. We observed that 57% of them proposed formal methods for identifying sections and 43% adapted a previously created method. Seventy-eight percent were intended for English texts and 41% for discharge summaries. Studies that are able to identify explicit (with headings) and implicit sections correspond to 46%. Regarding the level of granularity, 54% of the studies are able to identify sections, but not subsections. From the technical point of view, the methods can be classified into rule-based methods (59%), machine learning methods (22%) and a combination of both (19%). Hybrid methods showed better results than those relying on pure machine learning approaches, but lower than rule-based methods; however, their scope was more ambitious than the latter ones. Despite all the promising performance results, very few studies reported tests under a formal setup. Almost all the studies relied on custom dictionaries; however, they used them in conjunction with a controlled terminology, most commonly the UMLS (R) metathesaurus. Conclusions: Identification of sections in EHR narratives is gaining popularity for improving clinical extraction projects. This study enabled the community working on clinical NLP to gain a formal analysis of this task, including the most successful ways to perform it.",Review,"Pomares-Quimbaya, A.; Kreuzthaler, M.; Schulz, S.",Electronic health record; Machine learning; Natural language processing; Section identification; Clinical narrative; Free text,Electronic health record;Machine learning;Natural language processing;Section identification;Clinical narrative;Free text;MEDICAL-RECORDS;INFORMATION;EXTRACTION;IDENTIFICATION;ARCHITECTURE;COREFERENCE;RECOGNITION;CARE,Colombia;Austria,2-s2.0-85070105013

Molasses and vinasses were characterized by physicochemical methods. Subsequently, the samples were diluted in distilled water at five concentrations to obtain aqueous extracts. Total phenolic content (TPC) of the samples was determined using a spectrophotometric method and was expressed in mg equivalents of gallic acid. The antioxidant capacity of each sample was determined by DPPH (2,2-diphenyl-1-picrylhydrazyl radical) and ABTS (2,2-azino-bis-[3-ethylbenzothiazoline-6-sulfonic acid]) methods, as well as the ferric-reducing power in FRAP (Ferric-reducing Antioxidant Power) assay. We found that, both for TPC and antioxidant capacity, the vinasses showed significantly higher values than the B and C molasses. These results showed a strong correlation between TPC and antioxidant capacity and revealed a remarkable increase in TPC and total antioxidant agents present in the extracts throughout the sugarcane transformation process. These findings allowed identifying vinasses as the by-product with the best antioxidant properties. Our work constitutes a first step in the study of molasses and vinasses as a promising antioxidant agent and as a novel resource to test in proliferative trials in cellular systems in vitro.Graphical Abstract",Article,"Molina-Cortes, A.; Sanchez-Motta, T.; Tobar-Tosse, F.; Quimbaya, M.",Saccharum officinarum; Phenolic compounds; Sugarcane by-products; Sugarcane distillery spent wash; Bioactivity; Added value,Saccharum officinarum;Phenolic compounds;Sugarcane by-products;Sugarcane distillery spent wash;Bioactivity;Added value;MAILLARD REACTION;CANE SUGAR;MELANOIDINS;PRODUCTS;POWER;IDENTIFICATION;ANTHOCYANINS;ALTERNATIVES;FLAVONOIDS;COMPONENTS,Colombia,2-s2.0-85074485434;2-s2.0-85074485434

Structural genes encoding for each of the wild-type cysteine desulfurases were cloned into a vector containing the regulated ara promoter and further introduced into the mutant strains. Desulfurase-deficient cells transformed with homolog or paralog desulfurase genes and grown in arabinose-amended media restored their basal tellurite resistance. While csdB gene complemented the auxotrophy of csdB and iscS mutants for nicotinic acid, the iscS gene only complemented the auxotrophy of iscS cells for thiamine. Introduction of the csdA gene into the desulfurase-deficient strains did not change tellurite resistance or nutritional requirement patterns of the recipient cells. Complementation analysis could not be performed under anaerobic conditions because the three mutants did not show tellurite hypersensitivity.

Hunter syndrome (MC KUSIK 309900) or mucopolysachariclosis type 11 is due to the deficiency of the enzyme iduronate 2 sulfate sulfatase (E.C. 3.1.6.13). This enzyme has not been crystallized, and therefore the experimental structures are not available. Objectives. A computational three-dimensional model was proposed for the iduronate 2 sulfate sulfatase enzyme. Materials and methods. A computational analysis of this enzyme used the following free internet software programs: Comput pl/MW, JaMBW Chapter 3.1.7, SWISS-MODEL, Geno3d, ProSup. Energy minimization was done with Discover 3 and Insight 11 version 2004. Results. A three-dimensional conformational model was proposed. The model showed 33.3% of helix structure, 7.2% beta sheet, and 59.5% random coil. RMS values (Root Mean Square) (0.78 and 0.86 angstrom) were found when compared with other enzymes of the same family. The model presented 5 exposed N-glycosylation potential sites and an entry to the pocket that contains the amino acids of the active site. A high correlation was found between the type of mutations and the severity of the phenotype in twenty patients analyzed. Conclusion. The RMS values, as well as the high correlation between the type of mutation and the phenotype, indicated that the model predicts some aspects of the enzyme's biological behavior.",Article,"Saenz, H.; Lareo, L.; Poutou, R.A.; Sosa, A.C.; Barrera, L.A.",mucopolysacchariclosis II; iduronate sulfatase; tertiary protein structure; computing methods,mucopolysacchariclosis II;iduronate sulfatase;tertiary protein structure;computing methods;MUCOPOLYSACCHARIDOSIS TYPE-II;PROTEIN SECONDARY STRUCTURE;IDURONATE-2-SULFATASE GENE-MUTATIONS;HUNTER-SYNDROME;METHYLATION PATTERNS;MOLECULAR-BASIS;IDS GENE;SEQUENCE;IDENTIFICATION;DETERMINANTS,Colombia;Venezuela,

In vivo models of highly resistant cells allow us to evaluate the real impact of the immune response in the control of cancer. Materials and Methods: A tumor population derived from the 4T1 breast cancer cell line that was stable in vitro and highly aggressive in vivo was obtained, characterized, and determined to exhibit cancer stem cell (CSC) phenotypes (CD44(+), CD24(+), ALDH(+), Oct4(+), Nanog(+), Sox2(+), and high self-renewal capacity). Orthotopic transplantation of these cells allowed us to evaluate their in vivo susceptibility to chemo and immune responses induced after vaccination. Results: The immune response induced after vaccination with tumor cells treated with doxorubicin decreased the formation of tumors and macrometastasis in this model, which allowed us to confirm the immune response relevance in the control of highly chemotherapy-resistant ALDH(+) CSCs in an aggressive tumor model in immunocompetent animals.

,,,14,WOS:000308408700001,2012,Comparative analysis of diguanylate cyclase and phosphodiesterase genes in Klebsiella pneumoniae,"Background: Klebsiella pneumoniae can be found in environmental habitats as well as in hospital settings where it is commonly associated with nosocomial infections. One of the factors that contribute to virulence is its capacity to form biofilms on diverse biotic and abiotic surfaces. The second messenger Bis-(3'-5')-cyclic dimeric GMP (c-di-GMP) is a ubiquitous signal in bacteria that controls biofilm formation as well as several other cellular processes. The cellular levels of this messenger are controlled by c-di-GMP synthesis and degradation catalyzed by diguanylate cyclase (DGC) and phophodiesterase (PDE) enzymes, respectively. Many bacteria contain multiple copies of these proteins with diverse organizational structure that highlight the complex regulatory mechanisms of this signaling network. This work was undertaken to identify DGCs and PDEs and analyze the domain structure of these proteins in K. pneumoniae. Results: A search for conserved GGDEF and EAL domains in three sequenced K. pneumoniae genomes showed that there were multiple copies of GGDEF and EAL containing proteins. Both single domain and hybrid GGDEF proteins were identified: 21 in K. pneumoniae Kp342, 18 in K. pneumoniae MGH 78578 and 17 in K. pneumoniae NTUH-K2044. The majority had only the GGDEF domain, most with the GGEEF motif, and hybrid proteins containing both GGDEF and EAL domains were also found. The I site for allosteric control was identified only in single GGDEF domain proteins and not in hybrid proteins. EAL-only proteins, containing either intact or degenerate domains, were also identified: 15 in Kp342, 15 in MGH 78578 and 10 in NTUH-K2044. Several input sensory domains and transmembrane segments were identified, which together indicate complex regulatory circuits that in many cases can be membrane associated. Conclusions: The comparative analysis of proteins containing GGDEF/EAL domains in K. pneumoniae showed that most copies were shared among the three strains and that some were unique to a particular strain. The multiplicity of these proteins and the diversity of structural characteristics suggest that the c-di-GMP network in this enteric bacterium is highly complex and reflects the importance of having diverse mechanisms to control cellular processes in environments as diverse as soils or plants and clinical settings.",Article,"Cruz, D.P.; Huertas, M.G.; Lozano, M.; Zarate, L.; Zambrano, M.M.",Klebsiella pneumoniae; Biofilm; Diguanylate cyclase; Phosphodiesterase; c-di-GMP,Klebsiella pneumoniae;Biofilm;Diguanylate cyclase;Phosphodiesterase;c-di-GMP;BIOFILM FORMATION;COMPARATIVE GENOMICS;PROTEIN;TRANSDUCTION;DOMAIN;BACTERIA;IDENTIFICATION;RECOGNITION;RECEPTORS;VIRULENCE,Colombia,2-s2.0-84863515120;2-s2.0-84863515120

The aim of this study was to detect microbial markers to identify the source of fecal pollution in the Bogota River (Colombia). For this, we determined non-discriminating indicators such as Escherichia coli, somatic coliphages and phages infecting strain RYC2056 of Bacteroides, and potential source tracking markers as phages infecting strains GA17, HB13, and CA8 of Bacteroides, sorbitol-fermenting bifidobacteria, and molecular markers of Bifidobacterium adolescentis, Bifiodobacterium dentium, and Bacteroidetes in raw municipal wastewaters, slaughterhouse wastewaters, and the Bogota River. Bacteriophages infecting Bacteroides strain GA17 and the molecular markers identified the wastewater sources. In contrast, sorbitol-fermenting bifidobacteria failed regarding specificity. In the Bogota River, phages infecting strain GA17 were detected in all samples downstream of Bogota, whereas they should be concentrated from 1 vertical bar samples in upstream samples containing less than 10(3) E. coli/100 ml to be detected. In the river water, the fraction of positive detections of molecular markers was lower than that of phages infecting strain GA17. The ratio SOMCPH/GA17PH was shown also to be a good marker.

Two genes, STXBP4 and HIST2H2BA, were specifically associated with ER+ but not with ER- breast cancer. We further identified 30 TWAS-significant genes associated with overall breast cancer risk, including four that were not identified in previous studies.

The molecular profile of breast cancer has been widely described in non-Hispanic Whites but equivalent knowledge is lacking in Hispanic/Latinas. We have previously reported that the most prevalent breast cancer intrinsic subtype in Colombian women was Luminal B as defined by St. Gallen 2013 criteria. In this study we explored ancestry-associated differences in molecular profiles of Luminal B tumors among these highly admixed women. Methods We performed whole-transcriptome RNA-seq analysis in 42 Luminal tumors (21 Luminal A and 21 Luminal B) from Colombian women. Genetic ancestry was estimated from a panel of 80 ancestry-informative markers (AIM). We categorized patients according to Luminal subtype and to the proportion of European and Indigenous American ancestry and performed differential expression analysis comparing Luminal B against Luminal A tumors according to the assigned ancestry groups. Results We found 5 genes potentially modulated by genetic ancestry: ERBB2 (log2FC = 2.367, padj<0.01), GRB7 (log2FC = 2.327, padj<0.01), GSDMB (log2FC = 1.723, padj<0.01, MIEN1 (log2FC = 2.195, padj<0.01 and ONECUT2 (log2FC = 2.204, padj<0.01). In the replication set we found a statistical significant association between ERBB2 expression with Indigenous American ancestry (p = 0.02, B = 3.11). This association was not biased by the distribution of HER2+ tumors among the groups analyzed.

Such species must be correctly identified to ensure that appropriate control measures are taken and that suitable treatment is given for each species. Candida albicans is causing most fungal disease burden worldwide; the challenge lies in differentiating it from emerging atypical, minor and related species such as Candida dubliniensis and Candida africana. The purpose of this study was to compare identification based on MALDI-TOF MS to standard identification systems using a set of nosocomial isolates. Methods: Eleven nosocomial samples were collected from 6 third-level hospitals in Bogota, Colombia. All the samples were identified by combining MALDI-TOF MS with morphological characters, carbohydrate assimilation and molecular markers (D1/D2 and HWP1). Results: The present work describes the first collection of atypical Colombian Candida clinical isolates; these were identified as Candida albicans/Candida africana by their MALDI-TOF MS profile. Phenotypical characteristics showed that they were unable to produce chlamydospores, assimilate trehalose, glucosamine, N-acetyl-glucosamine and barely grew at 42 degrees C, as would be expected for Candida africana. The molecular identification of the D1/D2 region of large subunit ribosomal RNA and HWP1 hyphal cell wall protein 1 sequences from these isolates was consistent with those for Candida albicans. The mass spectra obtained by MALDI-TOF MS were analysed by multi-dimensional scaling (MDS) and cluster analysis, differences being revealed between Candida albicans, Candida africana, Candida dubliniensis reference spectra and two clinical isolate groups which clustered according to the clinical setting, one of them being clearly related to C. albicans. Conclusion: This study highlights the importance of using MALDI-TOF MS in combination with morphology, substrate assimilation and molecular markers for characterising Candida albicans-related and atypical C. albicans species, thereby overcoming conventional identification methods. This is the first report of hospital-obtained isolates of this type in Colombia; the approach followed might be useful for gathering knowledge regarding local epidemiology which could, in turn, have an impact on clinical management.

This Gram-negative, obligately intracellular pathogen is transmitted via tick bites, resulting in disseminated vascular endothelial cell infection with vascular leakage. In the infected human, Rickettsia conorii infects endothelial cells, stimulating expression of cytokines and pro-coagulant factors. However, the integrated proteomic response of human endothelial cells to R. conorii infection is not known. In this study, we performed quantitative proteomic profiling of primary human umbilical vein endothelial cells (HUVECs) with established R conorii infection versus those stimulated with endotoxin (LPS) alone. We observed differential expression of 55 proteins in HUVEC whole cell lysates. Of these, we observed induction of signal transducer and activator of transcription (STAT) 1, MX dynamin-like GTPase (MX1), and ISG15 ubiquitin-like modifier, indicating activation of the JAK-STAT signaling pathway occurs in R. conorii-infected HUVECs. The down-regulated proteins included those involved in the pyrimidine and arginine biosynthetic pathways. A highly specific biotinylated cross-linking enrichment protocol was performed to identify dysregulation of 11 integral plasma membrane proteins that included up-regulated expression of a sodium/potassium transporter and down-regulation of alpha-actin 1. Analysis of Golgi and soluble Golgi fractions identified up-regulated proteins involved in platelet-endothelial adhesion, phospholipase activity, and IFN activity. Thirty four rickettsial proteins were identified with high confidence in the Golgi, plasma membrane, or secreted protein fractions. The host proteins associated with rickettsial infections indicate activation of interferon-STAT signaling pathways; the disruption of cellular adhesion and alteration of antigen presentation pathways in response to rickettsial infections are distinct from those produced by nonspecific LPS stimulation. These patterns of differentially expressed proteins suggest mechanisms of pathogenesis as well as methods for diagnosis and monitoring Rickettsia infections.",Article,"Zhao, Y.X.; Valbuena, G.; Walker, D.H.; Gazi, M.; Hidalgo, M.; DeSousa, R.; Oteo, J.A.; Goez, Y.; Brasier, A.R.",,MEDITERRANEAN SPOTTED-FEVER;ACTIN POLYMERIZATION;SHOTGUN PROTEOMICS;IN-VIVO;EXPRESSION;PROTEINS;ADHESION;IDENTIFICATION;INTERFERON;SPECTROMETRY,United States;Colombia;Portugal;Spain,2-s2.0-84955465368

This work describes the K1 peptide's secondary structure and its recognition by sera from chagasic patients. Circular dichroism and NMR spectroscopy analysis revealed that the K1 peptide adopts an alpha-helical conformation. Fifty-six percent of individuals had anti-K1 and 86% anti-KMP-11 antibodies by ELISA in the chronic Chagas' group and 28 and 68% in the indeterminate Chagas' group, respectively. By contrast, no reactivity was observed in sera from healthy individuals and tuberculosis patients. Antibody response subclass specificity to the K1 peptide was IgG1 and IgG3.

Causal analysis, based on the fundamental properties of the load, is used to detail the reasoning which has led to this topology. In order to effectively control the lamp power, the operating mode of this converter combines discontinuous current mode and soft commutation (zero-current switching), obtaining low electromagnetic emissions and reduced switching losses as well. The model of the lamp is briefly presented, and it allows a simple state plane analysis to calculate all the electric variables involved in the converter and, consequently, to select the components of the supply. The mathematical relationships obtained from this process, for injected power control by means of the available degrees of freedom, are validated with simulations and experimental results.",Article,"Florez, D.; Diez, R.; Piquet, H.",Dielectric barrier discharge (DBD); gas discharge devices; plasma sources; resonant inverter; ultraviolet (UV) sources; zero-current switching (ZCS),Dielectric barrier discharge (DBD);gas discharge devices;plasma sources;resonant inverter;ultraviolet (UV) sources;zero-current switching (ZCS);DIELECTRIC-BARRIER DISCHARGES;DESIGN;EXCILAMPS;IMPLEMENTATION;IDENTIFICATION,Colombia;France,2-s2.0-84893300755

Trypanosoma rangeli is not pathogenic for humans but shows a high immunological cross-reactivity with Trypanosoma cruzi, the causative agent of Chagas' disease that affects more than 17 million people throughout the world. Recent studies have suggested that T. cruzi KMP-11 antigen could be a good candidate for the induction of immunoprotective cytotoxic responses against T. cruzi natural infection. In the present paper the genes coding for the T. rangeli kinetoplastid membrane protein-11 have been characterized. The results show that the locus encoding this protein is formed by 4 gene units measuring 550 nucleotides in length, organized in tandem, and located in different chromosomes in KP1(+) and KP1(-) strains. The gene units are transcribed as a single mRNA of 530 nucleotides in length. Alignment of the T. rangeli KMP-11 deduced amino acid sequence with the homologous KMP-11 protein from T. cruzi revealed an identity of 97%.

Clinical genetic testing is commercially available for rs61764370, an inherited variant residing in a KRAS 3' UTR microRNA binding site, based on suggested associations with increased ovarian and breast cancer risk as well as with survival time. However, prior studies, emphasizing particular subgroups, were relatively small. Therefore, we comprehensively evaluated ovarian and breast cancer risks as well as clinical outcome associated with rs61764370. Methods. Centralized genotyping and analysis were performed for 140,012 women enrolled in the Ovarian Cancer Association Consortium (15,357 ovarian cancer patients; 30,816 controls), the Breast Cancer Association Consortium (33,530 breast cancer patients; 37,640 controls), and the Consortium of Modifiers of BRCA1 and BRCA2 (14,765 BRCA1 and 7904 BRCA2 mutation carriers). Results. We found no association with risk of ovarian cancer (OR = 0.99, 95% CI 0.94-1.04, p = 0.74) or breast cancer (OR = 0.98, 95% CI 0.94-1.01, p = 0.19) and results were consistent among mutation carriers (BRCA1, ovarian cancer HR = 1.09, 95% CI 0.97-1.23, p = 0.14, breast cancer HR = 1.04, 95% CI 0.97-1.12, p = 0.27; BRCA2, ovarian cancer HR = 0.89, 95% CI 0.71-1.13, p = 034, breast cancer HR = 1.06, 95% CI 0.94-1.19, p = 0.35). Null results were also obtained for associations with overall survival following ovarian cancer (HR = 0.94, 95% CI 0.83-1.07, p = 0.38), breast cancer (HR = 0.96, 95% CI 0.87-1.06, p = 0.38), and all other previously-reported associations. Conclusions. rs61764370 is not associated with risk of ovarian or breast cancer nor with clinical outcome for patients with these cancers. Therefore, genotyping this variant has no clinical utility related to the prediction or management of these cancers. (C) 2015 Elsevier Inc.

Although most types of cancers exhibit genetic instability to some extent, in colorectal cancers genetic instability is a distinctive characteristic. Recent studies have shown that deregulation of genes involved in sister chromatid cohesion can result in chromosomal instability in colorectal cancers. Here, we show that the replisome factor minichromosome maintenance complex-binding protein (MCMBP), which is directly involved in the dynamics of the minichromosome maintenance complex and contributes to maintaining sister chromatid cohesion, is transcriptionally misregulated in different types of carcinomas. Cellular studies revealed that both MCMBP knockdown and overexpression in different breast and colorectal cell lines is associated with the emergence of a subpopulation of cells with abnormal nuclear morphology that likely arise as a consequence of aberrant cohesion events. Association analysis integrating gene expression data with clinical information revealed that enhanced MCMBP transcript levels correlate with an increased probability of relapse risk in colorectal cancers and different types of carcinomas. Moreover, a detailed study of a cohort of colorectal tumors showed that the MCMBP protein accumulates to high levels in cancer cells, whereas in normal proliferating tissue its abundance is low, indicating that MCMBP could be exploited as a novel diagnostic marker for this type of carcinoma.",Article,"Quimbaya, M.; Raspe, E.; Denecker, G.; De Craene, B.; Roelandt, R.; Declercq, W.; Sagaert, X.; De Veylder, L.; Berx, G.",,SISTER-CHROMATID COHESION;GENOMIC INSTABILITY;KINASE 1;MAINTENANCE;REPLICATION;CANCER;IDENTIFICATION;BP;MULTINUCLEATION;MECHANISMS,Belgium;Colombia,2-s2.0-84930799205

A total of 29% (n = 82) of HIV-infected and 45.5% (n = 15) of patients on hemodialysis exhibited S. aureus colonization. MSSA/MRSA colonization was observed in 28% and 3.6% of the HIV patients, respectively and in 42.4% and 13.3% of the hemodialysis patients, respectively. Staphylococcal cassette chromosome mec typing showed that four MRSA isolates harbored the type IV cassette, and one type I. In the hemodialysis group, two MRSA isolates were classified as belonging to the USA300-LV genetic lineage. Conversely, in the HIV infected group, no colonizing isolates belonging to the USA300-Latin American Variant (UDA300-LV) lineage were identified. Colonizing isolates recovered from the HIV-infected group belonged to the prevalent hospital-associated clones circulating in Latin America (Chilean [n = 1] and Pediatric [n = 2]). The prevalence of MRSA colonization in the study groups was 3.6% (HIV) and 13.3% (hemodialysis).

In the present study, we compared the virulence of these yeast species using two different experimental models: (i) Galleria mellonella larvae to evaluate the survival rate, fungal burden, histopathology and phagocytosis index and (ii) BALB/c mice to evaluate the survival. In addition, the fungal capacity to form biofilm over an inert surface was analyzed. Our results showed that in both experimental models, the animal survival rate was lower when infected with C. auris strains than the C. haemulonii species complex. The hemocytes of G. mellonella showed a significantly reduced ability to phagocytize the most virulent strains forming the C. haemulonii species complex. Interestingly, for C. auris, it was impossible to measure the phagocytosis index due to a general lysis of the hemocytes. Moreover, it was observed a greater capability of biofilm formation by C. auris compared to C. haemulonii species complex. In conclusion, we observed that C. auris and C. haemulonii complex have different levels of pathogenicity in the experimental models employed in the present study.",Article,"Munoz, J.E.; Ramirez, L.M.; Dias, L.D.; Rivas, L.A.; Ramos, L.S.; Santos, A.L.S.; Taborda, C.P.; Parra-Giraldo, C.M.",Candida auris; Candida haemulonii species complex; virulence; candidiasis; biofilm; Galleria mellonella,Candida auris;Candida haemulonii species complex;virulence;candidiasis;biofilm;Galleria mellonella;ANTIFUNGAL SUSCEPTIBILITY;AMPHOTERICIN-B;RESISTANT;IDENTIFICATION;NOV.,Colombia;Brazil,2-s2.0-85090721268;2-s2.0-85090721268

The insecticidal activity of the family Heterorhabditidae relies on a tight symbiotic relationship with enterobacteria of the genus Photorhabdus, where the bacterial contribution towards the death of the host has been highlighted. In the present work, we report the identification and pathogenic characterization of Photorhabdus luminescens strain SL0708, which is the natural symbiont of Heterorhabditis indica SL0708. We evaluated the pathogenicity of whole bacterial cells and acellular extracts against both Spodoptera frugiperda larvae and Galleria mellonella. Phylogenetic analyses using a polygenic sequencing approach assigned the bacterial strain to Photorhabdus luminescens subsp. akhurstii and bioassays showed it is highly pathogenic for both insects. After 48 h of treatment with 1 x 10(3) 1 x 10(4) CFU/larva, 100% mortality was attained. Furthermore, when intra- or extracellular bacterial extracts were injected into G. mellonella, a cumulative percent mortality of 63% and 100% was respectively obtained after 72 h. In contrast, a 10% and 93% mortality was achieved for S. frugiperda with intra and extracellular extracts, respectively highlighting the role of extracellular factors in pathogenicity. We detected extracellular activities potentially accounting for the high pathogenicity observed and these included; proteases, esterases, ureases, hemolysins and siderophores. Interestingly, S. frugiperda was more susceptible to P. luminescens SL0708 cells than G. mellonella, which contrasted to its higher resistance to H. indica SL0708 nematodes, which suggests that EPN biological control potential should also be evaluated based on bacterial symbiont pathogenicity.",Article,"Salazar-Gutierrez, J.D.; Castelblanco, A.; Rodriguez-Bocanegra, M.X.; Teran, W.; Saenz-Aponte, A.",Photorhabdus luminescens; Heterorhabditis; Entomopathogenic nematodes; Pathogenicity factors; Spodoptera frugiperda,Photorhabdus luminescens;Heterorhabditis;Entomopathogenic nematodes;Pathogenicity factors;Spodoptera frugiperda;SP NOV.;HETERORHABDITIS-BACTERIOPHORA;XENORHABDUS;SYMBIONT;GENOME;IDENTIFICATION;PHYLOGENY;REPRODUCTION;ASYMBIOTICA,Colombia,2-s2.0-85027564851

These species accounted for 51.7% of total phosphatidic acid, 47.3% of total phosphatidylethanolamine, 37.7% of total phosphatidylcholine, and 14.1% of total phosphatidylinositol. The last one showed the highest amounts of species containing palmitic acid, thus representing the most saturated phospholipid class. The extract was also shown to contain several peptide sequences with both potential antioxidant domains and interaction sites for phospholipids (i.e., H-Ala-Gly-Ser-Met-Met-Cys-NH2, H-Tyr-Met-Thr-Val-Val-Ala-Cys-NH2, etc.); this latter finding can have a highly positive impact on the poor peptides bioavailability.

Although an immune-suppressive effect of T. cruzi on the acute phase of the disease has been described, little is known about the capacity of CD8(+) T cell from chronic chagasic patients to respond to a non-T. cruzi microbial antigen. Methods: In the present paper, the frequency, phenotype and the functional activity of the CD8(+) T cells specific from Flu-MP*, an influenza virus epitope, were determined in 13 chagasic patients and 5 healthy donors. Results: The results show that Flu-MP* peptide specific CD8(+) T cells were found with similar frequencies in both groups. In addition, Flu-MP* specific CD8(+) T cells were distributed in the early or intermediate/late differentiation stages without showing enrichment of a specific sub-population. The mentioned Flu-MP* specific CD8(+) T cells from chagasic patients were predominately TEM (CCR7-CD62L-), producing IL-2, IFN gamma, CD107a/b and perforin, and did not present significant differences when compared with those from healthy donors.

Strain USBA-GBX-515 is a Gram-negative rod shaped bacterium of 1.0-3. 0 mu m x 0.5-1 mu m, motile and unable to form spores, it grows aerobically and cells show one single flagellum. Several genetic indices, the phylogenetic analysis of the 16S rRNA gene sequence and the phenotypic characterization confirmed that USBA-GBX-515 is a member of Pseudomonas genus and, the similarity of the 16S rDNA sequence was 100% with P. extremaustralis strain CT14-3T. The draft genome of P. extremaustralis strain USBA-GBX-515 consisted of 6,143,638 Mb with a G + C content of 60.9 mol%. A total of 5665 genes were predicted and of those, 5544 were protein coding genes and 121 were RNA genes. The distribution of genes into COG functional categories showed that most genes were classified in the category of amino acid transport and metabolism (10.5%) followed by transcription (8.4%) and signal transduction mechanisms (7.3%). We performed experimental analyses of the lipolytic activity and results showed activity mainly on short chain fatty acids. The genome analysis demonstrated the existence of two genes, lip515A and est515A, related to a triacylglycerol lipase and carboxylesterase, respectively. Ammonification genes were also observed, mainly nitrate reductase genes. Genes related with synthesis of poly-hydroxyalkanoates (PHAs), especially poly-hydroxybutyrates (PHBs), were detected. The phaABC and phbABC operons also appeared complete in the genome. P. extremaustralis strain USBA-GBX-515 conserves the same gene organization of the type strain CT14-3T.

It is composed by the subunits RPA-1, RPA-2 and RPA-3; the major DNA-binding activity resides in the subunit 1 of the heterotrimeric RPA complex. In yeast and higher eukaryotes, besides the three basic structural DNA-binding domains, the RPA-1 subunit contains an N-terminal region involved in protein-protein interactions with a fourth DNA-binding domain. Remarkably, the N-terminal extension is absent in the RPA-1 of the pathogenic protozoan Leishmania (Leishmania) amazonensis; however, the protein maintains its ability to bind ssDNA. In a recent work, we identify Leishmania (Viannia) braziliensis RPA-1 by its specific binding to the untranslated regions of the HSP70 mRNAs, suggesting that this protein might be also an RNA-binding protein. Methods: Both rLbRPA-1 purified by His-tag affinity chromatography as well as the in vitro transcribed L. braziliensis 3' HSP70-II UTR were used to perform pull down assays to asses nucleic acid binding properties. Also, homology modeling was carried out to construct the LbRPA-1 tridimensional structure to search relevant amino acid residues to bind nucleic acids. Results: In this work, after obtaining the recombinant L. braziliensis RPA-1 protein under native conditions, competitive and non-competitive pull-down assays confirmed the single-stranded DNA binding activity of this protein and demonstrated its interaction with the 3' UTR from the HSP70-II mRNA. As expected, this protein exhibits a high affinity for ssDNA, but we have found that RPA-1 interacts also with RNA. Additionally, we carried out a structural analysis of L. braziliensis RPA-1 protein using the X-ray diffraction structure of Ustilago maydis homologous protein as a template. Our results indicate that, in spite of the evolutionary divergence between both organisms, the structure of these two RPA-1 proteins seems to be highly conserved. Conclusion: The LbRPA-1 protein is a ssDNA binding protein, but also it shows affinity in vitro for the HSP70 mRNA; this finding supports a possible in vivo role in the HSP70 mRNA metabolism.

Usher syndrome is a disorder characterized by progressive retinitis pigmentosa, prelingual sensory hearing loss and vestibular dysfunction. It is the most frequent cause of deaf-blindness in humans. Three clinical types and twelve genetic subtypes have been characterized. Type II is the most common, and among these cases, nearly 80% have mutations in the USH2A gene. Objective. The aim of the study was to establish the mutational frequencies for the short isoform of USH2A gene in Usher syndrome type II. Materials and methods. Twenty-six Colombian individuals with Usher syndrome type II were included. SSCP analysis for 20 exons of the short isoform was performed and abnormal patterns were sequenced. Sequencing of exon 13 of the USH2A gene was performed for all the individuals because the most frequent mutation is located in this exon. Results. The most frequent mutation was c.2299delG, identified in the 27% (n=8) of the sample. The second mutation, p.R334W, showed a frequency of 15%. A new variant identified in the 5'UTR region, g.129G>T, was present in 1 individual (4%). Four polymorphisms were identified; one of them is a new deletion in exon 20, first reported in this study.

Manipulating Mycobacterium tuberculosis clinical specimens and cultures represents a risk factor for laboratory personnel. One of the processes that requires high concentrations of microorganisms is DNA extraction for molecular procedures. Pulmonary tuberculosis cases have occurred among professionals in charge of molecular procedures that require manipulation of massive quantities of microorganisms. This has prompted research studies on biosafety aspects of extraction protocols; however, as yet, no consensus has been reached regarding risks associated with the process. Objective. The biosafety was evaluated for the DNA extraction protocol of van Soolingen, et al. 2002 by determining M. tuberculosis viability at each process stage. Materials and methods. Eight hundred eighty cultures were grown from 220 M. tuberculosis clinical isolates that had been processed through the first three DNA extraction stages. Molecular identifications of positive cultures used a PCR isolation of a fragment of the heat shock protein PRA-hsp65 and examination of its restriction enzyme profile (spoligotyping). Results. Growth was seen in one culture with one of the procedures used. The molecular characterization did not correspond to the initially analyzed isolate, and therefore was deduced to be the product of a cross-contamination. Conclusion.

The process has been extensively analyzed in Trypanosoma brucei, Crithidia fasciculata, and Leishmania tarentolae. However, few data exist on this mechanism in pathogenic Leishmania species. Here, we show evidence that this process also operates in Leishmania braziliensis, being the first time that RNA editing has been described in a species of the Viannia subgenus. A partially edited transcript corresponding to the NADH dehydrogenase subunit 8 (ND8) gene was identified in L. braziliensis promastigotes. Sequence analysis allowed the identification of the maxicircle-encoded cryptogene, which shows a high degree of sequence conservation with the corresponding cryptogenes in other Leishmania species. Although an edition pattern could be postulated for the ND8 transcripts in L. braziliensis, attempts to isolate completely edited transcripts by RT-PCR were not fruitful; instead, many transcripts with partial and unexpected editing patterns were isolated. This data, together with our inability to detect full-size transcripts by Northern blotting in promastigotes of L. braziliensis, led us to the suggestion that the strain used in this study (M2904) lacks of critical RNA guides for a complete edition of ND8 transcripts.",Article,"Ramirez, C.; Puerta, C.; Requena, J.",,EDITED MESSENGER-RNAS;MITOCHONDRIAL GENOME;TRYPANOSOMA-BRUCEI;GENE;TARENTOLAE;IDENTIFICATION;AMASTIGOTES;TRANSCRIPTS;EVOLUTION;SUBUNIT,Spain;Colombia,2-s2.0-79955941135;2-s2.0-79955941135;2-s2.0-79955941135;2-s2.0-79955941135

The post-transcriptional mechanisms are particularly important in Leishmania parasites and related trypanosomatids since transcriptional regulation is almost absent in them. Thus, RBPs should be essential during the development of these parasites and for survival strategies against the adverse conditions that they face during their life-cycle. This work was aimed to do a structural and biochemical characterization of two Leishmania braziliensis proteins, which were previously found in pull-down assays using an HSP70 RNA as bait. At that time, these proteins were annotated as hypothetical proteins (LbrM. 25.2210 and LbrM. 30. 3080) in the GeneDB database. Results: Structural analysis indicated that these two proteins belong to evolutionarily conserved families; thus, they have been renamed accordingly as LbSCD6 (LbrM. 25.2210) and LbRBP42 (LbrM. 30.3080). We have demonstrated experimentally that these proteins are RBPs, in agreement with their structural features. Both proteins were able to bind to the complete 3' UTR-II region of HSP70-type II mRNA, and to an A + U rich element (ARE) present in that UTR. Cellular localization assays suggested that both proteins are mainly distributed in the cytoplasm of promastigotes growing at 26 degrees C, but they accumulate in foci around the nucleus when the parasites are under heat-shock conditions. Also, our study showed that steady-state levels of LbSCD6 and LbRBP42 transcripts decreased significantly during incubation of L. braziliensis promastigotes at heat-shock temperatures. However, in these conditions, the cellular content of both proteins remained unaltered. Conclusions: Our data suggest that LbSCD6 and LbRBP42, as occurs for their orthologues in other organisms, are involved in mRNA regulation, and probably they have a relevant role facing the stress conditions that L. braziliensis encounters during insect-to-mammalian transmission.",Article,"Nocua, P.A.; Ramirez, C.A.; Requena, J.M.; Puerta, C.J.",Leishmania braziliensis; RNA-binding proteins; NTF2 domain; Lsm domain; RRM domain; Heat shock,Leishmania braziliensis;RNA-binding proteins;NTF2 domain;Lsm domain;RRM domain;Heat shock;HSP70 MESSENGER-RNAS;RGG MOTIF PROTEINS;GENE-EXPRESSION;TRYPANOSOMA-CRUZI;STRESS GRANULES;TRAILER HITCH;DOMAINS;FAMILY;IDENTIFICATION;ORGANIZATION,Spain;Colombia,2-s2.0-85042325071;2-s2.0-85042325071

One of the challenges for this technology to be massively adopted is the optimization and effective management of the overall lamp-supply system. Accordingly, a methodology to study the impact of the operating point over the performance and operation of a DBD UV excilamp is developed and experimentally validated. The DBD operating point is parametrically adjusted by means of the power supply current with three independent variables: intensity, frequency, and duty cycle. This methodology allows the determination of the optimal operating point for the particular excilamp under study. These supplying conditions will be later achieved by means of a dedicated electrical generator, which has to be especially designed according to these specifications. It is found that an increment in the current intensity has a positive impact on the lamp efficiency and also leads to the existence of more filamentary discharges. Also, a relation between the energy of the pulse supplied to the DBD and the reactor efficiency can be established. For certain levels of UV power, energy savings on the reactor higher than 50% are attained by proper selection of the operating point.",Article,"Florez, D.; Diez, R.; Piquet, H.",Current control; dielectric barrier discharge (DBD); excimer lamp; ultraviolet (UV),Current control;dielectric barrier discharge (DBD);excimer lamp;ultraviolet (UV);DIELECTRIC BARRIER DISCHARGE;POWER;LAMP;EFFICIENCY;VOLTAGE;IDENTIFICATION;PARAMETERS;EXCITATION;RADIATION;EXCIPLEX,Colombia;France,2-s2.0-84971578350

The discriminatory efficiency of the serological tests varies according to the disease prevalence and the test-antigen used. Objective: To evaluate the discriminatory efficiency of the commercial kit Chagas (Trypanosoma cruzi) IgG-ELISA (R) (Nova Tec Immunodiagnostica GmbBH) in a group of Colombian individuals, using indirect immunofluorescence antibody testing (IFAT) and enzyme immunoassay (ELISA) tests as references. Materials and methods: Seventy-eight samples from chronic chagasic patients (36 asymptomatic and 42 symptomatic) and 21 healthy controls were included. Seventeen samples from non-infected people with Chagas' disease epidemiological risk, seven with leishmaniasis and nine with non-chagasic cardiomyopathy were also analyzed. Real time PCR was performed on four individuals whose results differed among tests. Results: Significant differences at 450 nm optical absorbance were found (p < 0.0001) when the median absorbance values of healthy controls (0.143), asymptomatic (2.401) and symptomatic (2.776) chagasic patients were compared, as well as when asymptomatic and symptomatic patients (p = 0.0408) and seronegative people with epidemiological risk (0.232), cardiomyopathy (0.367) or leishmaniasis (0.337) were compared with chagasic patients (p < 0.0001). Finally, there were differences among healthy controls and non-infected people with epidemiological risk (p = 0.0264), patients with non-chagasic cardiomyopathy (p = 0.0015) and patients with leishmaniasis (p = 0.002). Real-time PCR was positive in three out of four analyzed cases. Conclusions: The commercial ELISA test allowed us to discriminate the chagasic patients from the controls.

Generally, this protein is significantly involved in immune defense during infection in cells, but sometimes its anomalous activities produce some inflammatory diseases like rheumatoid arthritis and Crohn's disease. In the present study, the IL-18 gene was isolated from mice and was subsequently cloned and sequenced. Further, the network analysis was carried out to explore the functional role of IL-18 protein in animals. The 3D protein structure of the IL-18 protein was generated and docked with appropriate 3-([3-cholamidopropyl]dimethylammonio)-1-propanesulfonate (CPS) ligand. Later the complex structure of the protein was subjected to molecular dynamics simulation (MDS) for 50ns to determine the effect of ligand on protein. The network analysis explored the correlation of IL-18 protein with others proteins and their involvement in the different significant pathway to defend the cell from various diseases. As confirmed by MDS, the CPS:IL-18 complex was found to be highly stable. Our results further indicated that CPS ligand has the potential to act as a drug molecule, in future, for counteracting IL-18 activity. To date, no structural details were available for animal IL-18.

Among soil microorganisms, Actinomycetes play an important role in the sustainability of natural and agricultural systems: decomposition of organic matter; degradation of recalcitrant compounds like lignin; nitrogen fixation; degradation of agricultural chemicals and biological control in plants and animals. We evaluated their diversity in soils under three different vegetation covers (pasture, tropical primary forest and stubble) at two depths in the Southern Colombian Amazon border. We collected five replicates per vegetation type (in each, three samples at 0-20cm and three at 20-30cm; for a total of 30 samples). Abundance and phenotypic diversity were determined by plate counting. Genomic DNA was extracted from the isolates: the 16s rDNA gene was amplified with specific primers, and its genetic diversity was estimated by means of an amplified restriction analysis (ARDRA). Actynomicetes abundance varied with vegetation and depth, possibly reflecting presence of earthworms, macro-fauna and physico-chemical characteristics associated to fertility, as well as organic matter, total bases, and optimal capacity to cationic interchange. Primary forests had the highest diversity. Sixteen morpho-types (six genera) were identified; Streptomyces was the most abundant everywhere. The heterogeneity of ARDRA patterns prevented species identification because of the intra-species variability in sequences of 16s rDNA operons.

Given its lipid dependant status, the reference methods established by the Clinical and Laboratory Standards Institute (CLSI) to evaluate antifungal susceptibility in yeasts are not applicable. Aims: To evaluate the in vitro susceptibility of M.furfur isolates from infections in humans to antifungals of clinical use. Methods: The susceptibility profile to amphotericin B, itraconazole, ketoconazole and voriconazole of 20 isolates of M. furfur, using the broth microdilution method (CLSI M27-A3) and Etest (R), was evaluated. Results: Itraconazole and voriconazole had the highest antifungal activity against the isolates tested. The essential agreement between the two methods for azoles antifungal activity was in the region of 60-85% and the categorical agreement was around 70-80%, while the essential and categorical agreement for amphotericin B was 10%. Conclusions: The azoles were the compounds that showed the highest antifungal activity against M. furfur, as determined by the two techniques used; however more studies need to be performed to support that Etest is a reliable method before its implementation as a routine clinical laboratory test.

Sixteen isoenzyme patterns were analyzed for five Colombian Lutzomyia species. The average unbiased expected heterozygosity levels ranged from 0.098 (Lu. youngi) to 0.215 (Lu. torvida). The five species samples, taken all the isoenzymes employed, were significantly deviated from the Hardy-Weinberg equilibrium by homozygous excess with classical as well as Markov chain exact tests. Possible causes: (1) Wahlund effect within populations due to subdivision and/or sampling. Endogamy could be discarded because these loci were affected by highly different levels of homozygous excess. (2) Null alleles could be not discarded, at least for some isoenzymes. The hierarchical Wright's F analysis showed high and significant values for each parameter. The average F-IT value was 0.655 with a conspicous homozygous excess at a global level (all species taken together); the average F-IS value was significantly positive (0.515) as well, with homozygous excess within each species. The genetic heterogeneity between the fives species was noteworthy (F-ST = 0.288), indicating clear genetic differentiation.

As part of an effort to identify targets for therapeutic intervention, we carried out the kinetic characterization of the product of gene rv1700 of M. tuberculosis. Based on its sequence and its structure, the protein had been tentatively identified as a pyrophosphohydrolase specific for adenosine diphosphate ribose (ADPR), a compound involved in various pathways including oxidative stress response and tellurite resistance. In this work we carry out a kinetic, mutational and structural investigation of the enzyme, which provides a full characterization of this Mt-ADPRase. Optimal catalytic rates were achieved at alkaline pH (7.5-8.5) with either 0.5-1 mM Mg2+ or 0.02-1 mM Mn2+. K (m) and k (cat) values for hydrolysis of ADPR with Mg2+ ions are 200 +/- A 19 mu M and 14.4 +/- A 0.4 s(-1), and with Mn2+ ions are 554 +/- A 64 mu M and 28.9 +/- A 1.4 s(-1). Four residues proposed to be important in the catalytic mechanism of the enzyme were individually mutated and the kinetics of the mutant enzymes were characterized. In the four cases, the K (m) increased only slightly (2- to 3-fold) but the k (cat) decreased significantly (300- to 1900-fold), confirming the participation of these residues in catalysis.

Finally, chemical characterization by liquid chromatography-tandem mass spectrometry (UHPLC-q-TOF-MS/MS) of the optimum TE extract exhibited an important presence of hydroxycinnamic acid derivatives and other phenolic acids as well as quercetin hexoside and rutin, as main metabolites responsible for the observed biological properties.

The search for mechanisms that increase sensitivity to chemotherapy and also allow activation of the tumor-specific immune response is of high priority. As we observed throughout this review, natural products isolated or in standardized extracts, such as P2Et or others, could act synergistically, increasing tumor sensitivity to chemotherapy, recovering the tumor microenvironment, and participating in the induction of a specific immune response. This, in turn, would lead to the destruction of cancer stem cells and the decrease in metastasis.

Among the different nonhuman primate species tested so far for cytomegaloviruses (CMVs), only a few were from the New World. Seeking to identify CMV homologues in New World monkeys (NWMs), we carried out molecular screening of 244 blood DNA samples from 20 NWM species from Central and South America. Our aim was to reach a better understanding of their evolutionary processes within the Platyrrhini parvorder. Using PCR amplification with degenerate consensus primers targeting highly conserved amino acid motifs encoded by the herpesvirus DNA polymerase gene, we characterized novel viral sequences from 12 species belonging to seven genera representative of the three NWM families. BLAST searches, pairwise nucleotide and amino acid sequence comparisons, and phylogenetic analyses confirmed that they all belonged to the Cytomegalovirus genus. Previously determined host taxa allowed us to demonstrate a good correlation between the distinct monophyletic clades of viruses and those of the infected primates at the genus level. In addition, the evolutionary branching points that separate NWM CMVs were congruent with the divergence dates of their hosts at the genus level. These results significantly expand our knowledge of the host range of this viral genus and strongly support the occurrence of cospeciation between these viruses and their hosts. In this respect, we propose that NWM CMV DNA polymerase gene sequences may serve as reliable molecular markers with which to infer Platyrrhini phylogenetics. IMPORTANCE Investigating evolutionary processes between viruses and nonhuman primates has led to the discovery of a large number of herpesviruses. No study published so far on primate cytomegaloviruses has extensively studied New World monkeys (NWMs) at the subspecies, species, genus, and family levels. The present study sought to identify cytomegalovirus homologues in NWMs and to decipher their evolutionary relationships. This led us to characterize novel viruses from 12 of the 20 primate species tested, which are representative of the three NWM families. The identification of distinct viruses in these primates not only significantly expands our knowledge of the host range of this viral genus but also sheds light on its evolutionary history.

The first one thousand days are a window of opportunity to program health and disease. Exclusive breastfeeding may protect against obesity; however, it is not consistently practiced. Obesity rates have been increasing worldwide. Overweight or obese women have lower rates of breastfeeding and face mechanical, psychological and biological difficulties. Breastfeeding counselling is a successful strategy to support breastfeeding in normal weight women; but there is a lack of evidence on its effectiveness in overweight women. Our purpose is to evaluate a new approach to exclusive breastfeeding counselling based on Carl Rogers' Centred-Client Theory in overweight women, and to examine effects on breastfeeding prevalence, infant growth velocity and maternal postpartum weight loss. Methods A two-arm simple randomized controlled trial will be conducted in overweight and obese women recruited in a Baby Friendly Hospital in Bogota, Colombia. The intervention is exclusive breastfeeding counselling based on Rogers' theory but adapted for overweight women; it will be performed during the last month of pregnancy, 24 h after delivery and during early infancy (1 and 3 months postpartum). The primary outcomes will be exclusive breastfeeding prevalence, infant growth velocity and maternal weight loss from birth up to 4 months after delivery; and the secondary outcomes will be prolactin and macronutrient levels in breast milk and serum prolactin levels. Intention to treat analysis will be performed to estimate the effect of the new counselling approach compared to standard management on the prevalence of exclusive breastfeeding, infant growth velocity and maternal weight loss. Discussion We hypothesize that the intervention will result in an increase in the initiation and maintenance of exclusive breastfeeding, allowing adequate infant growth velocity and maternal weight loss after delivery. It is hoped that the results of this trial will provide evidence to support public health policy on supporting breastfeeding in this vulnerable group of women.",Article,"Aldana-Parra, F.; Olaya, G.; Fewtrell, M.",Maternal obesity; Maternal overweight; Obesity prevention; Infant growth velocity; Prolactin in overweight women; Postpartum weight loss; Breastfeeding counselling; Exclusive breastfeeding; Breastfeeding randomized controlled trial; Centred-Client counselling on breastfeeding,Maternal obesity;Maternal overweight;Obesity prevention;Infant growth velocity;Prolactin in overweight women;Postpartum weight loss;Breastfeeding counselling;Exclusive breastfeeding;Breastfeeding randomized controlled trial;Centred-Client counselling on breastfeeding;BODY-IMAGE;BLOOD-PRESSURE;DELAYED-ONSET;PROLACTIN;INITIATION;DURATION;RISK;LIFE;IDENTIFICATION,Colombia;United Kingdom,2-s2.0-85077740568

This virus can establish a persistent infection (PI) in calves after the fetal infection, making BVDV positive catle carriers and primary reservoirs which will constantly transmit the virus to healthy and new-born animals. For this reason, the detection of the PI animals in herds is the first line of prevention of the viral infection.ResultsIn this study, PI animals were detected in five different regions of Colombia through RT-PCR techniques and confirmed by sequencing. BVDV genotypes were determined using one fragment of the 5'UTR. It was found a 7% BVDV prevalence in animals and 22% in farms; and genotype 1 was identified as a single genotype for all of the samples. All samples were BVDV 1a.ConclusionThis is the first report in Colombia with higher prevalence rates compared with other places in the world, turned out to be of great importance for the ranchers, the vaccine producers and animal health control parties.",Article,"Barbosa, J.Q.; Figueroa, A.P.C.; Salas, S.S.; Camargo, H.; Sanchez, A.; Tobon, J.; Ortiz, D.; Schachtebeck, E.; Gutierrez, M.F.",Bovine viral diarrhea virus; Persistently infected animals; Genotype,Bovine viral diarrhea virus;Persistently infected animals;Genotype;HOBI-LIKE;MOLECULAR CHARACTERIZATION;VIRUS;PESTIVIRUSES;RHINOTRACHEITIS;IDENTIFICATION;DIVERSITY;ASSAYS;PCR,Colombia,2-s2.0-85059828627

Design/methodology/approach To do so, the authors use a 13-year data set and a time inhomogeneous hidden Markov model (HMM) in which the time variable transition matrix captures institutions' group switching behavior to identify these strategic groups. In fact, the authors consider a mixture model is the data generation process. Findings Two groups are identified. These groups are primarily characterized by size and other strategic variables. The probability of remaining in a group is generally high: 87.28 per cent for SG1 and 61.84 per cent for SG2. The probability of switching groups is low: 12.72 per cent probability of switching from SG1 to SG2 and 38.16 per cent probability of switching from SG2 to SG1. Banks in SG1 seem more stable over time; they have low levels of switching behavior and well-defined long-term behavior. Banks in SG2 seem to evolve in terms of group membership.

Lipases have gained special attention because they show unique properties such as: broad substrate specificity, enantio- and regio-selectivity and stability in organic solvents. A major goal is to identify novel lipolytic enzymes from microorganisms living in cold extreme environments such as high Andean soils, of relevance to our study being their capability be used in industrial processes. Paramo and glacier soils from the Nevados National Park in Colombia were sampled and microbial communities enriched through a fed-batch fermentation using olive oil as an inductor substrate. After 15 days of enrichment under aerobic conditions, total DNA was extracted. Subsequently, metagenomic libraries were constructed in the cosmid vector pWEB-TNC (TM). After functional screening, twenty and eighteen lipolytic clones were obtained from Paramo and Glacier soil enrichments, respectively. Based on lipid hydrolysis halo dimensions, the clone (Gla1) from a glacier enrichment was selected. A gene related to lipolytic activity was subcloned to evaluate enzyme properties. Phylogenetic analysis of the identified gene showed that the encoded lipase belongs to the family GDSL from a Ralstonia-like species. Interestingly, the secreted enzyme exhibited stability at high temperature and alkaline conditions, specifically the preferred conditions at 80 A degrees C and pH 9.0. Thus, with the identification of an enzyme with non-expected properties, in this study is shown the potential of extreme cold environments to be explored for new catalytic molecules, using current molecular biology techniques, with applications in industrial processes, which demand stability under harsh conditions.",Article,"Borda-Molina, D.; Montana, J.S.; Zambrano, M.M.; Baena, S.",Cold adapted enzymes; Enrichment cultures; Functional screening; Thermal stability,Cold adapted enzymes;Enrichment cultures;Functional screening;Thermal stability;METAGENOMIC LIBRARY;THERMOSTABLE LIPASE;MICROBIAL LIPASES;ESCHERICHIA-COLI;LOW-TEMPERATURES;GDSL FAMILY;DESERT SOIL;ESTERASE;IDENTIFICATION;EXPRESSION,Colombia,2-s2.0-85019577075

Estrogen and its subsequent signaling pathways play an important role in the occurrence of breast cancer relapse. Tamoxifen is the most common breast cancer treatment option in ER+ patients, which acts as an adjuvant endocrinotherapy with X-ray and surgery. This approach is recommended as the first-line treatment and has increased the survival rate of breast cancer patients and reduced the relapse cases. However, we can observe resistance to tamoxifen and relapse cases in one-third of patients treated with this drug, which has become a major concern. Objective: The precise mechanisms of relapse and resistance to tamoxifen have not yet been identified and were explored in this study. Methods: Microarray profiles of relapse and relapse-free patients were investigated to explain the processes leading to relapse and possibly to tamoxifen resistance. Results: According to the preliminary analysis, 1460 genes showed increased expression while 1132 genes showed decreased expression. According to our default for inclusion (-2LogFC >= + 2), 36 genes had increased expression (upregulated) while 33 genes had decreased expression (down-regulated). Conclusion: It seems that the mechanisms of resistance and relapse are multifactorial, and tumor cells induce relapse and resistance to tamoxifen through cell proliferation, survival, invasion, angiogenesis, extracellular matrix secretion, pump and membrane changes, and immune evasion.",Article,"Keikha, M.; Barreto, G.E.; Gonzalez, J.; Sahebkar, A.",Tamoxifen; breast cancer; relapse; microarray; estrogen; endocrinotherapy,Tamoxifen;breast cancer;relapse;microarray;estrogen;endocrinotherapy;TUMOR-SUPPRESSOR GENE;ENDOCRINE RESISTANCE;CELL-ADHESION;DYSREGULATED MICRORNAS;PROGESTERONE-RECEPTORS;EXPRESSION;PATHWAYS;IDENTIFICATION;PROTEOGLYCANS,Iran;Ireland;Colombia;Poland,2-s2.0-85103625143

This study was divided into two phases: first, a classification of the meteorological stations using two-dimensional self-organizing maps; second, the evaluation of the performance of the ANN by applying concepts of information entropy. Three scenarios were raised for the classification of the meteorological stations by adjusting the number of neurons in the output layer. A high number of neurons in the output layer were obtained, causing the model to over-fit while emphasizing differences amid patterns. When comparing the results of the scenarios, the permanence of certain characteristics and features was found in the system, validating the model classification. Subsequently, the results of the first scenario were used to evaluate the entropy of the historical series.

Its genetic etiology can be either a duplication (or other gene dosage alterations) or a punctual mutation at the PLP1 locus. Clinically, it presents with developmental delay, nystagmus and, spasticity, supported by neuroimaging in which the defect of myelination is evident. We present a series of seven Colombian patients diagnosed with this leucodystrophy, describing their genotypic and phenotypic characteristics and heterogeneity. Clinical Findings: All patients included were male, 6 months to 16 years of age. Mean age at onset of symptoms was 8 months. Mean age at diagnosis was 5 years 5 months, being classic PMD most frequently diagnosed, as compared to the connatal phenotype. All cases had a primary diagnosis of developmental delay on 100%, and in 28.7% of cases, early onset nystagmus was described. 85.7% of patients had spasticity, 71.4% cerebellar signs, 57.0% hypotonia, and 28.5% had an abnormal movement disorder. Only three patients were able to achieve gait, though altered. In the two patients who had a diagnosis of connatal PMD maturational ages in danger zones according to the WHO Abbreviated Scale of Psychosocial Development were documented. All cases had abnormalities in neuroimages. Molecular Analysis and Results: Molecular studies were used in the majority of the cases to confirm the diagnosis (85.7%). For two cases molecular confirmation was not considered necessary given their affected male brothers had already been tested. PLP1 gene dosage alterations (duplications) were found in 28.5% of the patients (two siblings), whereas three different single nucleotide variants were detected. Clinical Relevance: According to these findings, as authors we propose the diagnostic algorithm in Colombian population to begin on a high clinical suspicion, followed by paraclinical extension, moving on to the molecular confirmation by using approaches to simultaneously sequence the PLP1 gene in order to detect point mutations and in/dels and performing a copy number variation analysis for the detection of gene dosage alterations.",Article,"Parra, H.M.V.; Anaya, S.J.M.; Guio, J.C.A.; Diaz, C.E.A.; Rivera, J.C.P.",Pelizaeus Merzbacher disease; child development; developmental disorders; myelin sheath; Myelin proteolipidic protein; PLP1,Pelizaeus Merzbacher disease;child development;developmental disorders;myelin sheath;Myelin proteolipidic protein;PLP1;PROTEOLIPID PROTEIN GENE;MYELIN;DISORDERS;LEUKODYSTROPHIES;IDENTIFICATION,Colombia,2-s2.0-85051434139

Standard language resources available in the healthcare domain such as the UMLS metathesaurus or SNOMED CT are widely used for this purpose, but with limitations such as lexical ambiguity of clinical terms. However, most of them are unambiguous within text limited to a given clinical specialty. This is one rationale besides others to classify clinical text by the clinical specialty to which they belong. Results: This paper addresses this limitation by proposing and applying a method that automatically extracts Spanish medical terms classified and weighted per sub-domain, using Spanish MEDLINE titles and abstracts as input. The hypothesis is biomedical NLP tasks benefit from collections of domain terms that are specific to clinical subdomains. We use PubMed queries that generate sub-domain specific corpora from Spanish titles and abstracts, from which token n-grams are collected and metrics of relevance, discriminatory power, and broadness per sub-domain are computed. The generated term set, called Spanish core vocabulary about clinical specialties (SCOVACLIS), was made available to the scientific community and used in a text classification problem obtaining improvements of 6 percentage points in the F-measure compared to the baseline using Multilayer Perceptron, thus demonstrating the hypothesis that a specialized term set improves NLP tasks.

Two Andean soils under low temperatures were sampled: paramo and glacier soils from ""Los Nevados"" National Natural Park. Both soils were enriched through a fed-batch fermentation using olive oil as the inductor substrate. Forty-three lipolytic isolates were obtained and their taxonomic assignments were performed on the basis of 16S rDNA gene sequencing. In both cases, the phylum Proteobacteria represented the majority of the isolates. Qualitative assays to measure the lipolytic activity were performed by using tributyrin, triolein or olive oil (1%). Two isolates identified as Pseudomonas psychrophila and Stenotrophomonas rhizophila produced the largest hydrolysis halos, with an optimal activity at pH 8 and 50 degrees C. Only the S. rhizophila extracellular fraction hydrolyzed short and long chain pNP-esters, including pNP-palmitate. The broader substrate specificity of this isolate is probably due to the simultaneous presence of lipase and esterase activity in the crude extract.

Nonparametric statistical tests were performed to determine differences and to correlate bacterial populations and vectors. It was found that there is a significant relationship between the number of CFU ml(-1) of E. coli and the abundance of immature Ae. aegypti. It was established that there were differences in bacterial abundances between deposits with low, moderate, and high amounts of immature mosquitoes.

The Candida albicans complex is formed by Candida albicans, Candida dubliniensis, and a biovar of C. albicans named Candida africana. These yeasts are recognized as globally distributed clinical pathogens and share most phenotypic characteristics, which makes their discrimination by conventional methods difficult. Aim. To evaluate the efficacy of different brands of cigarettes in the preparation of tobacco agar, for the differentiation of these related yeasts. Methodology. Tobacco agar was prepared using six brands and four varieties of cigarettes, and 125 clinical isolates previously identified by PCR and Maldi-Tof were used. To determine whether the results of the microbiological tests were associated with similarities in the chemical components of cigarettes, thin-layer chromatography was performed. Results. Candida dubliniensis colonies presented hue differences according to the incubation temperature and the brand or variety of cigarette used, except in the tobacco agar produced with Marlboro Xpress cigarette, where its differentiation was not possible. The chromatograms showed few differences among apolar and medium polarity extract components. Conclusions. Tobacco agar is a low-cost tool used for the differentiation of Candida dubliniensis; however, incubation temperature and cigarette brand affect the performance of the media. No relationship was found between the microbiological results and the chemical similarity of the extracts of the cigarettes by chromatography.",Article,"Morales-Lopez, S.E.; Yepes, J.; Elles, D.C.; Macias, L.; Canate, A.; Camargo, J.R.",,DUBLINIENSIS;IDENTIFICATION,Colombia,2-s2.0-85082766793;2-s2.0-85082766793

Although TB prevalence has been coming down, extrapulmonary TB numbers remain stable; with approximately 1'050.000 new cases reported in the world in 2018. It usually presents by hematogenous or lymphatic dissemination of the Mycobacterium tuberculosis complex to other organs. The more often affected organs are pleura, lymph nodes, gastrointestinal tract, bone and joints. Rarely it can affect the central nervous system, urinary tract, upper respiratory airway, pericardium and skin. Clinical manifestations of extrapulmonary TB are heterogeneous due to its paucibacillary nature representing a clinical challenge for clinicians. Diagnostic work up depends on the affected organ, the quality and accessibility of the sample, the sensitivity of the test and the distribution of the mycobacteria in the tissue.

What Clinicians Ignore,"To narrow the gap between the bench and the clinic, healthcare personnel should have a basic understanding of molecular mechanisms ruling cell identity, since it establishes the key differences between health and disease states. Differential gene expression allows for protein synthesis required for the cell's biological function. In this process genes are selected from the entire genome to meet the cell's biological functioning and respond to internal and external stimuli. To this end, first the chromatin must be remodeled for the transcriptional machinery to gain access to DNA sequences coding for particular genes. DNA can then be transcribed into mRNA, followed by different processes leading to mature mRNA leaving the nucleus for protein synthesis in the cytoplasm. Any dysregulation in these processes results in disease. In the beginning of this millennium the human genome project sequenced the whole genome. Surprisingly, one of the main findings was only 2% of the genome represented protein coding sequences, which raised the question about the remainder of the genome and cell identity. Based on principles derived from the human genome project many investigations have shed light on mechanisms associated with disease. Thanks to advancements in differential gene expression, researchers are seeking for a better understanding in pathological processes associated with disease and the development of diagnostic tools.",Article,"Gomez, M.L.G.; Nunez, C.A.C.; Gomez, A.M.; Mesa, V.L.; Garcia, M.M.; Ramirez, N.V.; Moreno, M.D.A.; Camargo, D.; Rodriguez, J.P.B.; Martin, N.M.; Robles, C.A.F.; Daza, M.B.D.; Arguello, E.O.",differential gene expression; epigenetic modifications; methylation; acetylation; transcription,differential gene expression;epigenetic modifications;methylation;acetylation;transcription;GENE-EXPRESSION;DNA METHYLATION;TRANSCRIPTION FACTORS;EPIGENETIC MECHANISMS;CELL CARCINOMAS;HUMAN GENOME;DISEASE;MARK;SUPERSTRUCTURES;IDENTIFICATION,Colombia,

Aspects associated with its epidemiology and pathogenicity is a matter of interest. This study aimed to conduct a molecular characterization of 43 isolates of M. pachydermatis obtained from dogs with otitis externa. For this purpose, the 5.8S internal transcribed spacer 2 (ITS2) and D1/D2 26S rRNA regions were amplified, sequenced and analyzed using restriction fragment length polymorphism (RFLP) with Ahd,CfoI, and BstF5I endonucleases. Phylogenetic analyses revealed that these isolates grouped with the sequence types I, IV and V, previously proposed for M. pachydermatis. Interestingly, we found a new polymorphic RFLP pattern using BstF5l, these isolates were associated with the sequence types IV and V, nevertheless an association between polymorphic RFLP patterns, and fosfolipase activity or canine population data was not observed.

Objectives: To evaluate in non-complicated falciparum malaria patients undergoing treatment with amodiaquine-sulfadoxine-pyrimethamine (AQ-SP), some relationships between treatment response, nutritional status and characteristics of the gen CYP2C8. Methodology: A randomly assigned, balanced, non blind, controlled clinical design. Treatment response was assessed according to WHO 1998 criteria. Analysis included anthropometry, plasma levels of retinol, ferritin and selenium, and assessment of 2C8*1 (wild), 2C8*2 (Il29F) and 2C8*3 variants of CYP2C8 (R139K y K399R). Results: 33 patients were studied, all of them evidenced adequate treatment response, 10% had retinol deficiency, 25% selenium deficiency and 40% low ferritine levels. One patient exhibited the variant Il29F of CYP2C8*2 in a heterozygous fashion, the remaining individuals were homozygous for the wild form of this gene. The mutant R139K of CYP2C8*3 was absent in all individuals. Amplification fragments obtained of K339R (CYP2C8*3 gen) were not suitable for digestion, regardless of the modifications performed. These results confirm previous findings made in 22% of 23 patients in whom some variation was observed ( 5 in CYP2C8*2 and 2 in CYP2C8*3). For CYP2C8*3 the mutant R139K, was observed in 2 individuals. Conclusion: only one of the 33 patients (3%) had CYP2C8*2 in a heterozygous fashion, the remaining were homozygous for the wild allele of this variant.

Here, we introduce a standardized evaluation framework to reliably evaluate and compare the performance of the algorithms devised to detect and quantify the coronary artery stenoses, and to segment the coronary artery lumen in CIA data. The objective of this evaluation framework is to demonstrate the feasibility of dedicated algorithms to: (I) (semi-)automatically detect and quantify stenosis on CIA, in comparison with quantitative coronary angiography (QCA) and CIA consensus reading, and (2) (semi-)automatically segment the coronary lumen on CIA, in comparison with expert's manual annotation. A database consisting of 48 multicenter multivendor cardiac CIA datasets with corresponding reference standards are described and made available. The algorithms from 11 research groups were quantitatively evaluated and compared.

Published data reporting the results of laparoscopic sleeve gastrectomy (LSG) in patients with GERD are contradictory. In a previous observational study, we found that relative narrowing of the distal sleeve, hiatal hernia (HH), and dilation of the fundus predispose to GERD after LSG. In this study, we evaluated the effects of standardization of our LSG technique on the incidence of postoperative symptoms of GERD. Methods This was a concurrent cohort study. Patients who underwent bariatric surgery at our center were followed prospectively. LSG was performed in all patients in this series. Results A total of 234 patients underwent surgery. There were no cases of death, fistula, or conversion to open surgery. All 134 patients who completed 6-12 months of postoperative follow-up were evaluated. Excess weight loss at 1 year was 73.5 %. In the study group, 66 patients (49.2 %) were diagnosed with GERD preoperatively, and HH was detected in 34 patients (25.3 %) intraoperatively. HH was treated by reduction in three patients, anterior repair in 28, and posterior repair in three. Only two patients (1.5 %) had symptoms of GERD at 6-12 months postoperatively.

Sulfatase modifier factor 1 (SUMF1) was co-transfected to activate the enzyme fully. The E6-GALNS tagged enzyme had markedly prolonged clearance from circulation, giving over 20 times exposure time in blood, compared to untagged enzyme. The tagged enzyme was retained longer in bone, with residual enzyme activity demonstrable at 48 hours after infusion. The pathological findings in adult mice treated with tagged enzyme showed substantial clearance of the storage materials in bone, bone marrow, and heart valves, especially after 24 weekly infusions.

The average prevalence of diabetes in the Region is 8.0% and is expected to reach 9.8% by the year 2035. Prevalence is much lower in rural settings than in urban and the differences attributed to lifestyle changes may be a target for intervention. The indigenous population is a particularly vulnerable group needing special attention. On average, 24% of the adult cases with diabetes are undiagnosed but in some countries this is still as high as 50%. Health expenditure due to diabetes in the Region is around 9% of the global total. Inadequate glycemic control, defined as HbA1c >7%, is a strong predictor of chronic complications which increase resource use in the Region and less than half of the patients enrolled in diabetes care programmes are at target. Fifty percent or more of the adult population is overweight/obese and around one third of the adult population has metabolic syndrome using regional cutoffs for waist circumference. The number of people with IGT is almost equal to those with diabetes presenting an additional challenge for prevention. Children with type 1 diabetes represent only 0.2% of the total population with diabetes but the incidence may be increasing. In many places they have limited access to insulin, and even when available, it is not used appropriately.

Published data reporting the results of laparoscopic sleeve gastrectomy (LSG) in patients with GERD are contradictory. We have shown in a previous study that symptoms of GERD can be reduced for up to 12 months after LSG with careful attention to surgical technique. The present study prospectively evaluated the effect of a standardized LSG technique on the incidence of postoperative GERD symptoms in a larger sample, and followed patients for up to 22 months. This was a concurrent cohort study. All patients who underwent LSG at our center completed a standard multidisciplinary preoperative evaluation and were followed prospectively. A total of 382 patients underwent surgery. There were no cases of death or fistula. GERD was diagnosed in 170 patients (44.5 %) preoperatively, and hiatal hernia (HH) was detected in 142 patients (37.2 %) intraoperatively. Between 6 and 22 months postoperatively, 373 patients were completely evaluated. Ten (2.6 %) had GERD symptoms 6-22 months postoperatively, and 94 % of patients with preoperative GERD symptoms were asymptomatic at follow-up 6-22 months after LSG. Only 1 patient (0.5 %) of a subgroup of 174 without HH or esophagitis at preoperative evaluation had GERD at follow-up. Our results confirm that, contrary to previous reports of LSG in the literature, careful attention to surgical technique can result in significantly reduced GERD symptoms up to 22 months postoperatively suggesting that LSG does not predispose patients to GERD during that period.",Article,"Daes, J.; Jimenez, M.E.; Said, N.; Dennis, R.",Sleeve gastrectomy; Laparoscopic; Gastroesophageal reflux; Hiatal hernia; Technique,Sleeve gastrectomy;Laparoscopic;Gastroesophageal reflux;Hiatal hernia;Technique;Y GASTRIC BYPASS;MORBID-OBESITY;DISEASE;FUNDOPLICATION,Colombia,2-s2.0-84898049992;2-s2.0-84898049992

Here we hypothesize that some risk-associated variants might act in non-breast tissues, specifically adipose tissue and immune cells from blood and spleen. Using expression quantitative trait loci (eQTL) reported in these tissues, we identify 26 previously unreported, likely target genes of overall breast cancer risk variants, and 17 for estrogen receptor (ER)-negative breast cancer, several with a known immune function. We determine the directional effect of gene expression on disease risk measured based on single and multiple eQTL. In addition, using a gene-based test of association that considers eQTL from multiple tissues, we identify seven (and four) regions with variants associated with overall (and ER-negative) breast cancer risk, which were not reported in previous GWAS.

,,,51,WOS:000330080700003,2014,Angiotensin II induces Fat1 expression/activation and vascular smooth muscle cell migration via Nox1-dependent reactive oxygen species generation,"Fat1 is an atypical cadherin that controls vascular smooth muscle cell (VSMC) proliferation and migration. Nicotinamide adenine dinudeotide phosphate (NADPH) oxidase 1 (Nox1) is an important source of reactive oxygen species (ROS) in VSMCs. Angiotensin II (Mg II) induces the expression and/or activation of both Fat1 and Nox1 proteins. This study tested the hypothesis that Ang II-induced Fat1 activation and VSMC migration are mediated by Nox1-dependent ROS generation and redox signaling. Studies were performed in cultured VSMCs from Sprague-Dawley rats. Cells were treated with Ang II (1 prnol/L) for short (5 to 30 min) or long term stimulations (3 to 12 h) in the absence or presence of the antioxidant apocynin (10 mu mol/L), extracellular-signal-regulated kinases 1/2 ( Erk1/2) inhibitor P098059(1 mu mol/L), or Ang II type 1 receptor (AT1R) valsartan (1 mu mol/L). siRNA was used to knockdown Nox1 or Fat1. Cell migration was determined by Boyden chamber assay. Ang II increased Fat1 mRNA and protein levels and promoted Fat1 translocation to the cell membrane, responses that were inhibited by AT1R antagonist and antioxidant treatment. Downregulation of Nox1 inhibited the effects of Ang II on Fat1 protein expression. Nox1 protein induction, ROS generation, and p44/p42 MAPK phosphoiylation in response to Ang II were prevented by valsartan and apocynin, and Nox1 siRNA inhibited Ang II-induced ROS generation. Knockdown of Fat1 did not affect Ang II-mediated increases in Nox1 expression or ROS. Inhibition of p44/p42 MAPK phosphorylation by PD98059 abrogated the Ang II-induced increase in Fat1 expression and membrane translocation. Knockdown of Fat1 inhibited Ang Il-induced VSMC migration, which was also prevented by valsartan, apocynin, PD98059, and Nox1 siRNA. Our findings indicate that Ang II regulates Fat1 expression and activity and induces Fat1 -dependent VSMC migration via activation of AT1R, ERK1/2, and Nox1 -derived ROS, suggesting a role for Fat1 downstream of Ang II signaling that leads to vascular remodeling.

The Instituto de Genetica Humana of the Pontificia Universidad Javeriana conducted an epidemiological surveillance of congenital malformations as defined by criteria provided by the Latin American Collaborative Study of Congenital Malformations. Objective. The frequency of the main congenital malformations were tabulated for major urban centers in Colombia. Materials and methods. Information was gathered from 52,744 newborns between April 2001 and January 2008 in three cities of Colombia (Bogota, Ubate and Manizales). Data included the age of mother, gestational age, gender and weight of the newborn and the congenital malformation. Cases were classified according to a prognostic scale to assess the impact of health team interventions in the recovery process. Results. Congenital defects were noted in 3.1% of the newborns. The most frequent congenital defects were those of the ears. Clubfoot, polydactyly and cleft lip or palate were more common amongst males. The weight and gestational age were lower in the congenitally affected in comparison with the control group. The prognostic scale of congenital malformations indicated that most of these patients are at high risk of death or disability and that the intervention of the health team changed the patient's prognosis in approximately 80% of the cases. Conclusion. Frequencies of congenital malformations in Colombia were similar to those reported in other countries. The interventions of the health team in treating patients with congenital malformations directly affected patient prognosis. Therefore, early diagnosis and adequate interdisciplinary treatment were recommended by these data in order to reduce disability and improve the quality of life of these patients.",Article,"Zarante, I.; Franco, L.; Lopez, C.; Fernandez, N.",congenital abnormalities/epidemiology; prognosis; infant mortality; disabled children; International Classification of Functioning; Disability and Health,congenital abnormalities/epidemiology;prognosis;infant mortality;disabled children;International Classification of Functioning;Disability and Health;DOWN-SYNDROME;SIRENOMELIA;DISEASE,Colombia,

It also documents sociopolitical barriers and facilitators involved in urban interventions linked with active living in the ten most populated urban settings of Latin America. The synthesis of evidence indicates that several attributes of urban environments are associated with physical activity, including land-use mix and cycling infrastructure. The documentary analysis indicated that despite the benefits and opportunities provided by the programs and existing infrastructure in the examined cities, an overall concern is the rising inequality in the coverage and distribution of the initiatives in the region. If these programs and initiatives are to achieve a real population level effect that helps to reduce health disparities, they need to examine their social and spatial distribution within the cities so they can reach underserved populations and develop to their full potential.

In Colombia, data from 1980s described that HBV and HDV infection are important causes of hepatitis, but little is known about HCV infection. The aim of this study was to determine the currently frequency of HBV, HCV and HDV in four different Colombian regions. Methodology/Principal Findings: This study was conducted in 697 habitants from 4 Colombian departments: Amazonas, Choco, Magdalena and San Andres Islands. Epidemiological data were obtained from an interview applied to each individual aiming to evaluate risk factors related to HBV, HCV or HDV infections. All samples were tested for HBsAg, anti-HBc, anti-HBs and anti-HCV markers. Samples that were positive to HBsAg and/or anti-HBc were tested to anti-HDV. Concerning the geographical origin of the samples, the three HBV markers showed a statistically significant difference: HBsAg (p = 0.033) and anti-HBc (p < 0.001) were more frequent in Amazonas and Magdalena departments. Isolated anti-HBs (a marker of previous vaccination) frequencies were: Choco (53.26%), Amazonas (32.88%), Magdalena (17.0%) and San Andres (15.33%) p < 0.001. Prevalence of anti-HBc increased with age; HBsAg varied from 1.97 to 8.39% (p = 0.033). Amazonas department showed the highest frequency for anti-HCV marker (5.68%), while the lowest frequency was found in San Andres Island (0.66%). Anti-HDV was found in 9 (5.20%) out of 173 anti-HBc and/or HBsAg positive samples, 8 of them from the Amazonas region and 1 from them Magdalena department. Conclusions/Significance: In conclusion, HBV, HCV and HDV infections are detected throughout Colombia in frequency levels that would place some areas as hyperendemic for HBV, especially those found in Amazonas and Magdalena departments.

In chronic viral infections, this cell subset has effector memory phenotype and displays antigen specificity. No previous studies of double positive T cells in parasite infections have been carried out. Methodology/Principal Findings: Seventeen chronic chagasic patients (7 asymptomatic and 10 symptomatic) and 24 noninfected donors, including 12 healthy and 12 with non-chagasic cardiomyopathy donors were analyzed. Peripheral blood was stained for CD3, CD4, CD8, HLA-DR and CD38, and lymphocytes for intracellular perforin. Antigen specificity was assessed using HLA*A2 tetramers loaded with T. cruzi K1 or influenza virus epitopes. Surface expression of CD107 and intracellular IFN-gamma production were determined in K1-specific DP T cells from 11 chagasic donors. Heart tissue from a chronic chagasic patient was stained for both CD8 and CD4 by immunochemistry. Chagasic patients showed higher frequencies of DP T cells (2.1%+/- 0.9) compared with healthy (1.1%+/- 0.5) and non-chagasic cardiomyopathy (1.2%+/- 0.4) donors. DP T cells from Chagasic patients also expressed more HLA-DR, CD38 and perforin and had higher frequencies of T. cruzi K1-specific cells. IFN-gamma production in K1-specific cells was higher in asymptomatic patients after polyclonal stimulation, while these cells tended to degranulate more in symptomatic donors. Immunochemistry revealed that double positive T cells infiltrate the cardiac tissue of a chagasic donor. Conclusions: Chagasic patients have higher percentages of circulating double positive T cells expressing activation markers, potential effector molecules and greater class I antigenic specificity against T. cruzi. Although K1 tetramer positive DP T cell produced little IFN-gamma, they displayed degranulation activity that was increased in symptomatic patients.

However, all somatic mutations have been identified in DNA extracted from an archive of formalin-fixed cardiac tissues. In the present study, to address the hypothesis that somatic mutations are important in isolated CHDs, we analyzed the GATA4 and NKX2.5 genes in the fresh-frozen pathologic cardiac tissue specimen and corresponding non-diseased tissue obtained from a series of 62 CHD patients, including 35 patients with cardiac septal defects and 27 with other cardiac anomalies. We identified one variant and two common polymorphisms in the NKX2.5 gene, and six variants and two common polymorphisms in the GATA4 gene. All identified variants were seen in both the fresh-frozen pathologic cardiac tissue and the corresponding non-diseased tissue, which indicates that they all were constitutional variants. The present study has identified NKX2.5 and GATA4 constitutional variants in our CHD cohort, but was unable to replicate the previously published findings of high prevalence of somatically derived sequence mutations in patients with cardiac septal defects using fresh-frozen cardiac tissues rather than formalin-fixed tissues.

The relationship between the different stages of human Chagas' disease and the profiles of total IgG and its subclasses were thus analysed here; they were directed against a crude T. cruzi extract and three recombinant antigens: the T. cruzi kinetoplastid membrane protein-11 (rKMP-11), an internal fragment of the T. cruzi HSP-70 protein(192-433), and the entire Trypanosoma rangeli HSP-70 protein. Methods: Seventeen Brazilian acute chagasic patients, 50 Colombian chronic chagasic patients (21 indeterminate and 29 cardiopathic patients) and 30 healthy individuals were included. Total IgG and its subtypes directed against the above-mentioned recombinant antigens were determined by ELISA tests. Results: The T. cruzi KMP-11 and T. rangeli HSP-70 recombinant proteins were able to distinguish both acute from chronic chagasic patients and infected people from healthy individuals. Specific antibodies to T. cruzi crude antigen in acute patients came from IgG3 and IgG4 subclasses whereas IgG1 and IgG3 were the prevalent isotypes in indeterminate and chronic chagasic patients. By contrast, the specific prominent antibodies in all disease stages against T. cruzi KMP-11 and T. rangeli HSP-70 recombinant antigens were the IgG1 subclass. Conclusion: T. cruzi KMP-11 and the T. rangeli HSP-70 recombinant proteins may be explored together in the immunodiagnosis of Chagas' disease.

A less predictive alternate measurement is known as the body mass index (BMI). Objective. Obesity prevalence was estimated first by BMI and then by abdominal obesity (measured by waist circumference, WC) in primary care patients. Materials and methods. As part of an international study, primary care physicians recruited consecutive patients aged 18 to 80 years who consulted for any reason on two pre-specified half-days. Age, gender, smoking status and history of cardiovascular disease or diabetes were recorded. Height, weight and WC were measured using standard methods. Pregnant women and subjects unwilling to participate were excluded. Results. A total of 3,795 patients from 105 primary care centers located throughout Colombia were evaluated. The mean age was 45 years (69% females). Of these, 60.7% of males and 53.9% of females were overweight or obese according to their BMI; 24.6% of males and 44.6% of females had abdominal obesity when National Cholesterol Education Program guidelines were used, but numbers changed to 62.5% and 67.0% when the International Diabetes Federation guidelines were used. Obesity, either determined by BMI or by WC, was associated with higher prevalence of diabetes, hypertension and dyslipidemia. Conclusions. Increased waist circumference is a practical and useful marker for cardiovascular and metabolic conditions. The prevalence of abdominal obesity in Colombian primary care patients is high and more frequent in females.",Article,"Ruiz, A.J.; Aschner, P.J.; Puerta, M.F.; Alfonso-Cristancho, R.",obesity; overweight; body weight; mortality; abdominal circumference; body mass index; risk factors,obesity;overweight;body weight;mortality;abdominal circumference;body mass index;risk factors;WAIST CIRCUMFERENCE;CARDIOVASCULAR RISK;METABOLIC SYNDROME;LATIN-AMERICA;INTRAABDOMINAL ADIPOSITY;TIME TRENDS;DISEASE;BUCARAMANGA;HEALTH;IMPACT,Colombia;United States,

To delineate this clinical association, we investigated the phenotypical features of OSA in asthmatic children. Specifically, we hypothesized that asthmatic children have a distinct OSA phenotype that involves a higher prevalence of Rapid-Eye-Movement (REM)-related breathing abnormalities relative to children with OSA alone. Methods We conducted a retrospective cross-sectional analysis of 141 children aged 2-12 years with OSA diagnosed by polysomnography (PSG) in our sleep center. Outcomes included PSG parameters, maximal %SaO2 REM desaturations and prevalence of REM-related OSA. Multivariate linear regression model or logistic regression model was built to study the joint effect of asthma and OSA parameters with control for potential confounders (significance level P<0.05). Results Baseline respiratory parameters, obstructive apnea-hypopnea index (OAHI) severity, and oxygenation during NREM sleep were unaffected by the presence of asthma in children with OSA. In contrast, maximal %SaO2 REM desaturation, REM-OAHI and prevalence of REM-related OSA in children with moderate-severe OSA were significantly increased in asthmatic children with OSA compared to subjects with OSA alone. Multivariate analysis revealed that the association between asthma and REM-related OSA parameters is independent of asthma control, BMI, age, and gender. The presence of REM-related OSA in asthmatics was unaffected by rhinitis or atopic status. Conclusion These results demonstrate that asthma is associated with REM-related breathing abnormalities in children with moderate-severe OSA. The link between asthma and REM-related OSA is independent of asthma control and obesity. Further research is needed to delineate the REM-sleep biological mechanisms that modulate the phenotypical expression of OSA in asthmatic children. Pediatr Pulmonol. 2013; 48:592-600.

A theoretical approach of our previous experiments reporting the cytoprotective effects of the Valeriana officinalis compounds extract for PD is suggested. In addiction to considering the PD as a result of mitochondrial metabolic imbalance and oxidative stress, such as in our previous in vitro model of rotenone, in the present manuscript we added a genomic approach to evaluate the possible underlying mechanisms of the effect of the plant extract. Microarray of substantia nigra (SN) genome obtained from Allen Brain Institute was analyzed using gene set enrichment analysis to build a network of hub genes implicated in PD. Proteins transcribed from hub genes and their ligands selected by search ensemble approach algorithm were subjected to molecular docking studies, as well as 20 ns Molecular Dynamics (MD) using a Molecular Mechanic Poison/Boltzman Surface Area (MMPBSA) protocol. Our results bring a new approach to Valeriana officinalis extract, and suggest that hesperidin, and probably linarin are able to relieve effects of oxidative stress during ATP depletion due to its ability to binding SUR1. In addition, the key role of valerenic acid and apigenin is possibly related to prevent cortical hyperexcitation by inducing neuronal cells from SN to release GABA on brain stem. Thus, under hyperexcitability, oxidative stress, asphyxia and/or ATP depletion, Valeriana officinalis may trigger different mechanisms to provide neuronal cell protection.",Article,"Santos, G.; Giraldez-Alvarez, L.D.; Avila-Rodriguez, M.; Capani, F.; Galembeck, E.; Neto, A.G.; Barreto, G.E.; Andrade, B.",Valeriana officinalis; Parkinson disease; neuroprotection; SUR1; GABAA,Valeriana officinalis;Parkinson disease;neuroprotection;SUR1;GABAA;SENSITIVE POTASSIUM CHANNELS;VALERENIC ACID-DERIVATIVES;OXIDATIVE STRESS;CUDRANIA-TRICUSPIDATA;MOLECULAR-MECHANISMS;NEUROPROTECTIVE ROLE;DOPAMINE METABOLISM;IN-VITRO;DISEASE;ROTENONE,Brazil;Colombia;Argentina;Chile;Peru,2-s2.0-84974560104

Although genotype-phenotype correlations have been reported, these approaches have not enabled to establish a complete genotype-phenotype correlation, and they have not considered a ligand-enzyme interaction. In this study, we expanded the in silico evaluation of GALNS mutations by using several bioinformatics tools. Tertiary GALNS structure was modeled and used for molecular docking against galactose-6-sulfate, N-acetylgalactosamine-6-sulfate, keratan sulfate, chondroitin-6-sulfate, and the artificial substrate 4-methylumbelliferyl-beta-D-galactopyranoside-6sulfate. Furthermore, we considered the evolutionary residue conservation, change conservativeness, position within GALNS structure, and the impact of amino acid substitution on the structure and function of GALNS. Molecular docking showed that amino acids involved in ligand interaction correlated with those observed in other human sulfatases, and mutations within the active cavity reduced affinity of all evaluated ligands. Combination of several bioinformatics approaches allowed to explaine 90 % of the missense mutations affecting GALNS, and the prediction of the phenotype for another 21 missense mutations. In summary, we have shown for the first time a docking evaluation of natural and artificial ligands for human GALNS, and proposed an update in genotype-phenotype correlation for Morquio A, based on the use of multiple parameters to predict the disease severity.",Article,"Olarte-Avellaneda, S.; Rodriguez-Lopez, A.; Almeciga-Diaz, C.J.; Barrera, L.A.",MPS IV A; GALNS; Keratan sulfate; Chondroitin-6-sulfate; Molecular modeling; Computational molecular docking,MPS IV A;GALNS;Keratan sulfate;Chondroitin-6-sulfate;Molecular modeling;Computational molecular docking;MUCOPOLYSACCHARIDOSIS IVA;REPLACEMENT THERAPY;HIGH-THROUGHPUT;DISEASE;EXPRESSION;MUTATIONS;GENE;PROTEINS;SPECTRUM;SERVER,Colombia,

Bogota, Colombia","Background: Congenital anomalies (CAs) cause nearly one third of infant deaths worldwide. Various surveillance systems have been established, such as the Bogota Congenital Malformations Surveillance Program (BCMSP). Some CAs are of special interest to pediatric surgeons: omphalocele, gastroschisis, intestinal and esophageal atresia, anorectal malformations, vascular anomalies, diaphragmatic hernias, hypospadias and cryptorchidism. The aim of this study is to determine the prevalence of such CAs, and identify possible risk factors. Methods: Data from the BCMSP were collected between January 2005 and April 2012. CAs were classified in accordance with the ICD-10 and grouped for analysis purposes. Data on CA frequencies were obtained from the BCMSP. Association analyses were performed using the case-control methodology. Results: 282,523 births were registered. 4682 (1.66%) had one or more CAs at birth. The prevalence of CAs requiring pediatric surgery was 1 in 1000. The most frequent CAs were vascular anomalies, hypospadias, and anorectal malformations. Exposure to external factors was significantly associated with selected CAs. 51% of selected birth defects were not diagnosed in prenatal ultrasound. Conclusions: This study highlights the importance of evaluating the local prevalence of congenital malformations. We propose the creation of specialized centers in Bogota to manage patients with CAs.

Recently an enzyme replacement therapy (ERT) for this disease was approved using a recombinant enzyme produced in CHO cells. Previously, we reported the production of an active GALNS enzyme in Escherichia coli that showed similar stability properties to that of a recombinant mammalian enzyme though it was not taken-up by culture cells. In this study, we showed the production of the human recombinant GALNS in the methylotrophic yeast Pichia pastoris GS115 (prGALNS). We observed that removal of native signal peptide and co-expression with human formylglycine-generating enzyme (SUMF1) allowed an improvement of 4.5-fold in the specific GALNS activity. prGALNS enzyme showed a high stability at 4 degrees C, while the activity was markedly reduced at 37 and 45 degrees C. It was noteworthy that prGALNS was taken-up by HEK293 cells and human skin fibroblasts in a dose-dependent manner through a process potentially mediated by an endocytic pathway, without any additional protein or host modification.

Methods: A retrospective cohort study using data from English practices from CPRD GOLD (Clinical Practice Research Datalink) and the SCI-Diabetes dataset (Scottish Care Information-Diabetes), with linkage to hospital and mortality data. We identified 101 749 with type 2 diabetes (T2D) in CPRD matched with 378 938 controls without diabetes and 330 892 with type 2 diabetes in SCI-Diabetes between 2006 and 2015. The main exposure was number of optimized risk factors: nonsmoker, total cholesterol <= 4 mmol/L, triglycerides <= 1.7 mmol/L, glycated haemoglobin (HbA1c) <= 53 mmol/mol (<= 7.0%), systolic blood pressure <140mm Hg, or Results: In CPRD, the mean baseline age in T2D was 63 years and 28% had cardio-renal disease (SCI-Diabetes: 62 years; 35% cardio-renal disease). Over 3 years follow-up (SCI-Diabetes: 6 years), CVD events occurred among 27 900 (27%) CPRD-T2D, 101 362 (31%) SCI-Diabetes-T2D, and 75 520 (19%) CPRD-controls. In CPRD, compared with controls, T2D participants with optimal risk factor control (all risk factors controlled) had a higher risk of CVD events (adjusted hazard ratio, 1.21; 95% confidence interval, 1.12-1.29). In T2D participants from CPRD and SCI-Diabetes, pooled hazard ratios for CVD associated with 5 risk factors being elevated versus optimal risk factor control were 1.09 (95% confidence interval, 1.01-1.17) in people with cardio-renal disease but 1.96 (95% confidence interval, 1.82-2.12) in people without cardio-renal disease. People without cardio-renal disease were younger and more likely to have suboptimal risk factor control but had fewer prescriptions for risk factor modifying medications than those with cardio-renal disease.

,,,20,WOS:000370888100347,2016,Systems biology study of mucopolysaccharidosis using a human metabolic reconstruction network,"Mucopolysaccharidosis (MPS) is a group of lysosomal storage diseases (LSD), characterized by the deficiency of a lysosomal enzyme responsible for the degradation of glycosaminoglycans (GAG). This deficiency leads to the lysosomal accumulation of partially degraded GAG. Nevertheless, deficiency of a single lysosomal enzyme has been associated with impairment in other cell mechanism, such as apoptosis and redox balance. Although GAG analysis represents the main biomarker for MPS diagnosis, it has several limitations that can lead to a misdiagnosis, whereby the identification of new biomarkers represents an important issue for MPS. In this study, we used a system biology approach, through the use of a genome-scale human metabolic reconstruction to understand the effect of metabolism alterations in cell homeostasis and to identify potential new biomarkers in MPS. In-silico MPS models were generated by silencing of MPS-related enzymes, and were analyzed through a flux balance and variability analysis. We found that MPS models used approximately 2286 reactions to satisfy the objective function. Impaired reactions were mainly involved in cellular respiration, mitochondrial process, amino acid and lipid metabolism, and ion exchange. Metabolic changes were similar for MPS I and II, and MPS III A to C; while the remaining MPS showed unique metabolic profiles. Eight and thirteen potential high-confidence biomarkers were identified for MPS IVB and VII, respectively, which were associated with the secondary pathologic process of LSD. In vivo evaluation of predicted intermediate confidence biomarkers (beta-hexosaminidase and beta-glucoronidase) for MPS IVA and VI correlated with the in-silico prediction. These results show the potential of a computational human metabolic reconstruction to understand the molecular mechanisms this group of diseases, which can be used to identify new biomarkers for MPS.

The study aim was to determine if a relationship exists between MetS and chronic periodontitis in adult Colombians. Participants were 220 healthy-gingivitis subjects and 431 periodontitis patients coming from the three largest Colombian cities. Periodontal status and MetS were determined in subjects. Univariate analysis and odds ratio were calculated within the 95 % confidence intervals and chi(2) test compared the groups. Variables were compared among the clinical periodontal groups and MetS by Wilcoxon and multivariate analysis, and logistic regression was performed for MetS and periodontitis. MetS had higher prevalence in periodontitis group (6.3 %) versus controls (3.2 %). In multivariate analysis, periodontitis was associated with MetS (adjusted OR = 2.72, 95 % CI 1.09-6.79), glucose intolerance with another component of MetS (adjusted OR = 1.78, 1.16 to 2.72), glucose resistance (adjusted OR = 11.46, 95 % CI 1.41-92.88), smoking (OR = 1.72, 95 % CI 1.09-2.71), and city of origin (2.69, 95 % CI 1.79-4.04). The study confirmed the positive association between MetS and periodontitis, being glucose sensitivity the strongly associated component.

We studied two sympatric species of frogs from the Colombian Andes, which coexist with the amphibian pathogen Batrachochytrium dendrobatidis (Bd), to understand why some species did not succumb to the infection. We found high Bd prevalence in juveniles for both species, yet infection intensities remained low. We also found that bacterial community composition and host defense peptides are specific to amphibian life stages. We detected abundant Bd-inhibitory skin bacteria across life stages and Bd-inhibitory defense peptides post-metamorphosis in both species. Bd-inhibitory bacteria were proportionally more abundant in adults of both species than in earlier developmental stages. We tested for activity of peptides against the skin microbiota and found that in general peptides did not negatively affect bacterial growth and in some instances facilitated growth.

Nevertheless, it remains controversial whether antioxidant-rich supplements have real beneficial effects on health, especially in complex diseases such as cancer. We previously identified a polyphenol-rich extract obtained from Caesalpinia spinosa (P2Et) with anti-tumor activity in both breast carcinoma and melanoma. The present work evaluated the ability of P2Et extract to modulate the immune system in either the steady state or following tumor challenge. We found that the prophylactic treatment of healthy mice increased the number of CD4(+) and CD8(+) activated T, NK, regulatory T, dendritic and myeloid-derived suppressor cells in lymphoid organs together with a significant increase in plasma IL-6. Interestingly, this pre-conditioning of the host immune system with P2Et did not involve a protective effect against the control of tumor growth and metastasis in transplantable models of melanoma (B16) and breast cancer (4T1), but in contrast, a detrimental effect was observed in both models. We further demonstrated that this effect was at least partly due to an increase in regulatory T cells, myeloid-derived suppressor cells, and proinflammatory cytokines, with a concomitant decrease in CD4(+) and CD8(+) T cells. Taken together, these results suggest that the anti-tumor and immunomodulation properties of the P2Et extract critically depend on the presence of the tumor and might be mediated by the complex interactions between the tumor cells and the other components of the tumor microenvironment.",Article,"Lasso, P.; Gomez-Cadena, A.; Uruena, C.; Donda, A.; Martinez-Usatorre, A.; Barreto, A.; Romero, P.; Fiorentino, S.",polyphenols; immune response; cancer; immunomodulation; proinflammatory,polyphenols;immune response;cancer;immunomodulation;proinflammatory;MYELOID SUPPRESSOR-CELLS;REGULATORY T-CELLS;CANCER STEM-CELLS;GREEN TEA;RANDOMIZED-TRIAL;BETA-CAROTENE;RESVERATROL;PREVENTION;REDUCTION;DISEASE,Colombia;Switzerland,2-s2.0-85052909509

Methods: The International ChoLesterol management Practice Study (ICLPS) investigated achievement of European Society of Cardiology (ESC)/European Atherosclerosis Society (EAS) guideline low-density lipoprotein cholesterol (LDL-C) targets in patients receiving lipid-modifying therapy in countries outside Western Europe. We examined the rate of, and association between, control of multiple risk factors in ICLPS participants with dyslipidaemia, diabetes and hypertension (N = 2377). Results: Mean (standard deviation) age of patients was 61.4 (10.4) years; 51.3% were male. Type 2 diabetes was the most common form of diabetes (prevalence, 96.9%).

The brain is the second most abundant organ in terms of lipid concentration and diversity only after adipose tissue. However, in the central system (CNS) lipid dysregulation has been linked to the etiology, progression, and severity of neurodegenerative diseases such as Alzheimers, Parkinson, and Multiple Sclerosis. Advances in the human genome and subsequent sequencing technologies allowed us the study of lipidomics as a promising approach to diagnosis and treatment of neurodegeneration. Lipidomics advances rapidly increased the amount and quality of data allowing the integration with other omic types as well as implementing novel bioinformatic and quantitative tools such as machine learning (ML). Integration of lipidomics data with ML, as a powerful quantitative predictive approach, led to improvements in diagnostic biomarker prediction, clinical data integration, network, and systems approaches for neural behavior, novel etiology markers for inflammation, and neurodegeneration progression and even Mass Spectrometry image analysis. In this sense, by exploiting lipidomics data with ML is possible to improve the identification of new biomarkers or unveil new molecular mechanisms associated with lipid impairment across neurodegeneration. In this review, we present the lipidomic neurobiology state-of-the-art highlighting its potential applications to study neurodegenerative conditions.

As genetic heritability for IS is estimated at about 35%-40%, the identification of genetic variants associated with IS risk is of great importance. The main objective of this study was to carry out a meta-analysis for polymorphisms in CRP, EPHX2, FGA, and NOTCH3 genes and the risk for IS. Methods: Literature search for 6 candidate polymorphisms and IS was conducted using HuGE Navigator, PubMed, and Google Scholar databases. Meta-Analyst program was used to calculate pooled odds ratios (ORs) with a random effects model. Results: Twenty-five published studies for 6 candidate polymorphisms were included: CRP-rs1800947 (5 studies), CRP-rs1205 (3 studies), EPHX2-rs751141 (5 studies), FGA-rs6050 (6 studies), NOTCH3-rs3815188 (3 studies), and NOTCH3-rs1043994 (3 studies), for a total number of 7,825 IS cases and 56,532 control subjects. We did not find significant pooled ORs (P values > .05) for any of the genetic variants evaluated in this work. Conclusions: Our meta-analysis results did not show significant associations between these 6 polymorphisms in 4 candidate genes and IS, despite the functional role of some of these single nucleotide polymorphisms (e.g., rs6050 in FGA gene).

Disability adjusted life years (DALYs) have been developed to compare the burden of this disease both between conditions and between geographical boundaries. With improving data on disease incidence and prevalence in Colombia, we can refine our DALYs-based estimates. Methods: Using different strategies, including the official healthcare provision database and death certificates, as well as extrapolation from published neuroepidemiologic studies, we estimated the incidence and prevalence by age groups, disease duration and attributable mortality. With this information we calculated DALYs for the year 2012. Results: Overall, it was found that epilepsy was responsible for 0.88% of all deaths in Colombia. A total of 5.25 DALYs per 1,000 person-years are lost due to epilepsy in Colombia, 75% of which (3.91 DALYs) are due to premature mortality, with a higher burden in men (6.12 DALYs) than in women (4.41 DALYs). Conclusions: We reported new estimations on epilepsy incidence and prevalence by age groups in Colombia and conclude that DALYs lost due to epilepsy in Colombia are almost double the previous figure, mostly because of the underestimation of attributable mortality. With this figure, epilepsy ranks 12th instead of 19th in the list of the most important causes of DALYs lost. (C) 2015 S.

Mucopolysaccharidosis (MPS) type 11, an X-linked disorder, results from the deficiency of iduronate-2-sulfatase (IDS). In these patients, over 35% of independent point mutations at the IDS gene locus were found at CpG sites as transitional events. To gain insight into the relationship between methylation status and CpG hot spot mutations, we investigated patterns of cytosine methylation in the entire IDS gene, except for introns 4-8. Bisulfite genomic sequencing was performed on the normal leukocyte DNA. Our data show that: 1) cytosine methylation at the CpG sites was extensive, except for those present from the promoter region to a portion of intron 3; 2) a sharp boundary of methylated-nonmethylated regions was observed at the 5'-flanking region, whereas a gradual change in methylation was observed in the 2.0-kb segment in the 3'-flanking region; 3) the boundary of the 5'-flanking region contained multiple Sp1 sites and the TATA box; 4) the CpG sites in exons 1 and 2 were hypomethylated and were associated only with rare transitional mutations, while the CpG sites in exon 3 were also hypomethylated, yet were associated with a high rate of transitional mutations; 5) there was no striking sex difference in the methylation patterns in active alleles; and, 6) the methylation in both strands was symmetrical, except at the boundary of methylated-unmethylated regions.

To update the information on the geographic distribution of battransmitted rabies foci in Colombia and evaluate the biotic and abiotic conditions associated with the incidence of this disease in the country. Methods. Observational study of a database containing information on the wild rabies foci identified between 1982 and 2010 and the cattle population in each municipality. The municipalities were classified according to the disease's risk of transmission, and an environmental characterization of 15 variables was carried out. A maximum entropy model was developed to predict which areas had conditions appropriate for the presence of the Desmodus rotundus vector infected by the virus and to evaluate the importance of the variables employed. Results. There were 2 330 foci in 359 (31.8%) of the country's 1 128 municipalities; 144 municipalities were classified as high risk. The highest incidence rates were found in Monteria, Valledupar, Riohacha, Aguachica, Unguia, Acandi, Rio de Oro, Tibu, Sahagun, and San Onofre. Rabies foci were found year-round but were more frequent (linear correlation [r] = 0.64) during the dry months (January to April). Temperature and precipitation were the variables contributing the greatest robustness to the prediction model. Conclusions. Prevention and control measures should be implemented in high-risk municipalities. The best months for conducting vaccination campaigns are June, November, and December.

The use of nanoparticles in drug delivery therapy holds much promise in targeting remote tissues, and as a result many studies have attempted to study the ultrastructural localization of nanoparticles in various tissues. However, there are currently no in vivo studies demonstrating the ultrastructural distribution of nanoparticles in the brain. The aim of this study was to address how intraperitoneal injection of silver nanoparticles in the brain leads to leaking on the inter-endothelial contact and luminal plasma membrane, thus elucidating the possibility of penetrating into the most affected areas in the Alzheimer brain (vascular endothelium, perivascular, neuronal and glial cells). Our results show that the silver nanoparticles reached the brain and were found in hippocampal areas, indicating that they can be conjugated and used to deliver the drugs into the cell cytoplasm of the damaged brain cells.

To fine-map this locus, we genotyped 92 SNPs in a 900kb region (120,505,799-121,481,132) flanking rs11249433 in 45,276 breast cancer cases and 48,998 controls of European, Asian and African ancestry from 50 studies in the Breast Cancer Association Consortium. Genotyping was done using iCOGS, a custom-built array. Due to the complicated nature of the region on chr1p11.2: 120,300,000-120,505,798, that lies near the centromere and contains seven duplicated genomic segments, we restricted analyses to 429 SNPs excluding the duplicated regions (42 genotyped and 387 imputed). Perallelic associations with breast cancer risk were estimated using logistic regression models adjusting for study and ancestry-specific principal components. The strongest association observed was with the original identified index SNP rs11249433 (minor allele frequency (MAF) 0.402; per-allele odds ratio (OR) = 1.10, 95% confidence interval (CI) 1.08-1.13, P = 1.49 x 10(-21)). The association for rs11249433 was limited to ER-positive breast cancers (test for heterogeneity P <= 8.41 x 10(-5)). Additional analyses by other tumor characteristics showed stronger associations with moderately/well differentiated tumors and tumors of lobular histology. Although no significant eQTL associations were observed, in silico analyses showed that rs11249433 was located in a region that is likely a weak enhancer/promoter.

IDS deficiency causes the Hunter syndrome or mucopolysaccharidosis type II (MPS II; OHM 309900). We have been developing an expression system for human recombinant IDS (hrIDS) in Pichia pastoris, therefore a method was required for its detection during production and purification processes, which could be used also to measure the enzyme in human fluids. In this study, an immunoquantification assay for human and recombinant IDS was developed with the combination of two antibodies. Rabbit IgG and chicken IgY were used as IDS capture and detection antibodies, respectively. Chicken IgY antibodies were developed against specific amino add sequences present in IDS but absent in other human sulfatases. hrIDS produced in P. pastoris, commercial hrIDS, and normal human plasma samples were used as antigens and immunoquantification results were compared to enzyme activity. The technique was linear over the range 8 to 500 ng mL(-1) using commercial hrIDS. The concentration range detected for IDS in normal human plasma was 14.43 to 287.88 ng mL(-1). The hrIDS was detected in P. pastoris cultures even when the enzyme was inactive, which is convenient for monitoring the production of recombinant proteins. These results show that chicken site-specific antibodies provide a good alternative, as a substitute of monoclonal antibodies, for the detection of human proteins.

In this study, the effect of the signal peptide (SP), inducer concentration, process scale, and operational mode (batch and semi-continuous) on GALNS production were evaluated. When native SP was presented, higher enzyme activity levels were observed in both soluble and inclusion bodies fractions, and its removal had a significant impact on enzyme activation. At shake scale, the optimal IPTG concentrations were 0.5 and 1.5 mM for the strains with and without SP, respectively, whereas at bench scale, the highest enzyme activities were observed with 1.5 mM IPTG for both strains. Noteworthy, enzyme activity in the culture media was only detected when SP was presented and the culture was carried out under semi-continuous mode. We showed for the first time that the mechanism that in prokaryotes recognizes the SP to mediate sulfatase activation can also recognize a eukaryotic SP, favoring the activation of the enzyme, and could also favor the secretion of the recombinant protein.

As part of the Latin American Study of Nutrition and Health (ELANS), data were collected from 2524 participants (18-65 years) across eight countries. Participants reported time spent sedentary in different activities (computer use at home, videogame use, reading, sitting down to chat with friends/relatives or listening to music, speaking on the phone, watching TV, and riding in a car). Overall sitting time was assessed using a single item from the International Physical Activity Questionnaire (IPAQ). Device-based sedentary time was assessed using Actigraph GT3X accelerometers. Self-reported overall sitting time (227.1 min/day) produced the lowest values of the three assessment methods, followed by self-reported sum of different types of sedentary behavior (364.1 min/day) and device-based sedentary time (568.6 min/day). Overall, correlation coefficients and ICC varied from weak to moderate (rho: 0.25-0.39; ICC: 0.21:0.39) between self-reported sum of different types of sedentary behavior, self-reported overall sitting time, and device-based sedentary time. The Bland-Altman plots indicated low to moderate agreement between self-reported overall sitting time and device-based sedentary time by sex.

Hypertension guidelines recommendation on attaining SBP levels < 150 mmHg in this population is currently based on experts' opinion. To clarify this issue, we systematically reviewed and quantified available evidence on the impact of achieving different SBP levels < 150 mmHg on various adverse outcomes in subjects aged >= 60 years old receiving antihypertensive drug treatment. Methods: We searched 8 databases to identify randomized controlled trials (RCTs) and post-hoc analyses or subanalyses of RCTs reporting the effects of attaining different SBP levels < 150 mmHg on the risk of stroke, acute myocardial infarction, heart failure, cardiovascular mortality and all-cause mortality in participants aged >= 60 years. We performed random-effects meta-analyses stratified by study design. Results: Eleven studies (> 33,600 participants) were included. Compared with attaining SBP levels >= 140 mmHg, levels of 130 to < 140 mmHg were not associated with lower risk of outcomes in the meta-analysis of RCTs, whereas there was an associated reduction of cardiovascular mortality (RR 0.72, 95% CI 0.59-0.88) and all-cause mortality (RR 0.86, 95% CI 0.75-0.99) in the meta-analysis of post-hoc analyses or subanalyses of RCTs.

By co-culturing mesenchymal stem cells (MSC) with the REH acute lymphocytic leukemia (ALL) cell line, we have established an in vitro leukemic niche for the functional evaluation of hematopoietic stem/progenitor cells (HSPC, CD34+ cells). We showed that the normal homeostatic control exerted by the MSC over the HSPC is considerably lost in this leukemic microenvironment: HSPC increased their proliferation rate and adhesion to MSC. The adhesion molecules CD54 and CD44 were consequently upregulated in HSPC from the leukemic niche. Consequently, with this adhesive phenotype, HSPC showed less Stromal derived factor-1 (SDF-1)-directed migration. Interestingly, multipotency was severely affected with an important reduction in the absolute count and the percentage of primitive progenitor colonies. It was possible to simulate most of these HSPC alterations by incubation of MSC with a REH-conditioned medium, suggesting that REH soluble factors and their effect on MSC are important for the observed changes. Of note, these HSPC alterations were reproduced when primary leukemic cells from an ALL type B (ALL-B) patient were used to set up the leukemic niche. These results suggest that a general response is induced in the leukemic niche to the detriment of HSPC function and in favor of leukemic cell support. This in vitro leukemic niche could be a valuable tool for the understanding of the molecular events responsible for HSPC functional failure and a useful scenario for therapeutic evaluation.",Article,"Vernot, J.P.; Bonilla, X.; Rodriguez-Pardo, V.; Vanegas, N.D.",hematopoietic stem cells; progenitor cells; leukemic niche; cell malfunction; microenvironment; mesenchymal stem cell; proliferation; adhesion; multipotency; REH-conditioned medium,hematopoietic stem cells;progenitor cells;leukemic niche;cell malfunction;microenvironment;mesenchymal stem cell;proliferation;adhesion;multipotency;REH-conditioned medium;ACUTE LYMPHOBLASTIC-LEUKEMIA;BONE-MARROW MICROENVIRONMENT;CHRONIC MYELOGENOUS LEUKEMIA;CHRONIC LYMPHOCYTIC-LEUKEMIA;NICHE;DISEASE;DIFFERENTIATION;ACTIVATION;PROTEIN;ANEMIA,Colombia,2-s2.0-85012960732;2-s2.0-85012960732;2-s2.0-85012960732
,,,7,WOS:000352120900006,2015,Altering the motility of Trypanosoma cruzi with rabbit polyclonal anti-peptide antibodies reduces infection to susceptible mammalian cells,"Trypanosoma cruzi's trypomastigotes are highly active and their incessant motility seems to be important for mammalian host cell infection. The kinetoplastid membrane protein-11 (KMP-11) is a protein expressed in all parasite stages, which induces a cellular and humoral immune response in the infected host, and is hypothesized to participate in the parasite's motility. An N-terminal peptide from KMP-11, termed K1 or TcTLE, induced polyclonal antibodies that inhibit parasitic invasion of Vero cells. The goal of this study was to evaluate the motility and infectivity of Trypanosoma cruzi when exposed to polyclonal anti-TcTLE antibodies. Rabbits were immunized with TcTLE peptide along with FIS peptide as an immunomodulator. ELISA assay results showed that post-immunization sera contained high titers of polyclonal anti-TcTLE antibodies, which were also reactive against the native KMP-11 protein and live parasites as detected by immunofluorescence and flow cytometry assays. Trypomastigotes of Trypanosoma cruzi were incubated with pre- or post-immunization sera, and infectivity to human astrocytes was assessed by Giemsa staining/light microscope and flow cytometry using carboxyfluorescein diacetate succinimidyl ester (CFSE) labeled parasites. Trypanosoma cruzi infection in astrocytes decreased approximately by 30% upon incubation with post-immunization sera compared with pre-immunization sera. Furthermore, trypomastigotes were recorded by video microscopy and the parasite's flagellar speed was calculated by tracking the flagella. Trypomastigotes exposed to post-immunization sera had qualitative alterations in motility and significantly slower flagella (45.5 mu m/s), compared with those exposed to pre-immunization sera (69.2 mu m/s). In summary, polyclonal anti-TcTLE serum significantly reduced the parasite's flagellar speed and cell infectivity. These findings support that KMP-11 could be important for parasite motility, and that by targeting its N-terminal peptide infectivity can be reduced. (C) 2015 Elsevier Inc.

Design: A retrospective, descriptive observational study was carried out. Setting: A pediatric intensive care unit. Patients: Pediatric patients requiring sedoanalgesia between October 1, 2009 and September 30, 2010. Interventions: None. Data collected: Demographic, clinical and laboratory test variables, diagnosis, treatment, complications and evolution in each patient. In addition, the potential adverse effects associated with propofol administration were analyzed. Results: Midazolam, fentanyl and propofol were the most commonly used sedative and analgesic drugs. Seventy-one out of 222 patients (32%) received propofol in continuous infusion. The average dose was 2.1 mg/kg/h (SD 1.3, range: 0.5 to 6), and the average duration of treatment was of 6.7 days (SD 8.5 range 0.5-40). Fifty-two percent were males, and the mean patient age was 45.8 months (median: 24; interquartile range: 7-65). No patient developed propofol infusion syndrome or other serious drug-related adverse effects. Patients treated with propofol showed more abnormal laboratory test findings, although no relationship to drug administration could be demonstrated. There were no significant differences in lactate level or in the incidence of infection in either group. Conclusions: Propofol at a dose of 1 to 4 mg/kg/h is a safe alternative for sustained sedation in critically ill children. However, further studies are needed to assess its effects and safety profile. (C) 2011 Elsevier Espana, S.L. and SEMICYUC.

Heart rate variability (HRV) is analyzed by measuring consecutive beat-to-beat intervals. This variability can contain information about the factors regulating cardiac activity under normal and pathological conditions, but the information obtained from such analyses is not yet fully understood. In this article, HRV in zebrafish larvae was evaluated under normal conditions and under the effect of substances that modify intrinsic cardiac activity and cardiac activity modulated by the nervous system. We found that the factors affecting intrinsic activity have negative chronotropic and arrhythmogenic effects at this stage of development, whereas neural modulatory factors have a lesser impact. The results suggest that cardiac activity largely depends on the intrinsic properties of the heart tissue in the early stages of development and, to a lesser extent, in the maturing nervous system. We also report, for the first time, the influence of the neurotransmitter gamma amino butyric acid on HRV.

Animal models are widely used to achieve these goals, and zebrafish have emerged as a low-cost model that produces rapid results. Currently, a large body of research is devoted to the cardiovascular development and diverse cardiovascular disorders of zebrafish embryos and larvae. However, less research has been conducted on adult zebrafish specimens. In this study, we evaluated a method to obtain and to evaluate morphometric parameters (of both the entire animal and the heart) of adult zebrafish.

Currently, enzyme replacement therapy using an enzyme produced in CHO cells represents the main treatment option for MPS IVA patients. As an alternative, we reported the production of an active GALNS enzyme produced in the yeast Pichia pastoris (prGALNS), which showed internalization by cultured cells through a potential receptor-mediated process and similar post-translational processing as human enzyme. In this study, we further studied the therapeutic potential of prGALNS through the characterization of the N-glycosylation structure, in vitro cell uptake and keratan sulfate reduction, and in vivo biodistribution and generation of anti-prGALNS antibodies. Taken together, these results represent an important step in the development of a P. pastoris-based platform for production of a therapeutic GALNS for MPS IVA enzyme replacement therapy.

Additionally, hyperglycemia, independent of associated comorbidities, is related to the loss of muscle mass and strength, and contributes to functional impairment in older adults. We studied the mediation effect of glucose levels, in the relationship between abdominal obesity and relative handgrip strength (HGS). A total of 1571 participants (60.0% women, mean age 69.1 +/- 7.0 years) from 86 municipalities were selected following a multistage area probability sampling design. Measurements included demographic and anthropometric/adiposity markers (weight, height, body mass index, and waist circumference). HGS was measured using a digital dynamometer for three sets and the mean value was recorded. The values were normalized to body weight (relative HGS). Fasting glucose was analyzed by enzymatic colorimetric methods. Mediation analyses were performed to identify associations between the independent variable (abdominal obesity) and outcomes (relative HGS), as well as to determine whether fasting glucose levels mediated the relationship between excess adiposity and relative HGS. A total of 1239 (78.8%) had abdominal obesity. Abdominal obesity had a negative effect on fasting glucose (beta = 9.04, 95%CI = 5.87 to 12.21); while fasting glucose to relative HGS was inversely related (beta = -0.003, 95%CI = -0.005 to -0.001),p< 0.001. The direct effect of abdominal obesity on relative HGS was statistically significant (beta = -0.069, 95%CI = -0.082 to -0.057),p< 0.001. Lastly, fasting glucose levels mediates the detrimental effect of abdominal obesity on relative HGS (indirect effect beta = -0.002, 95%CI = -0.004 to -0.001),p< 0.001.

We explore the impact of the pandemic on cancer research funding, output, and conduct. We sought information at national level and used the experience of an academic reference center to contrast the impact at institutional level. We searched databases and official documents of national governmental institutions, trial registries, hospital registries, and the Web of Science. We interviewed principal investigators (PIs) to retrieve information on the conduct of cancer research. A decline in resource availability and new proposals was observed at the national level with a shift to COVID-19 related research. However, at institutional level there was no decline in the number of cancer research proposals. The predominance of observational studies as opposed to the preponderance of clinical trials and basic science in high-income countries may be related to the lower impact at institutional level. Nevertheless, we found difficulties similar to previous reports for conducting research during the pandemic. PIs reported long recovery times and a great impact on research other than clinical trials, such as observational and qualitative studies. No significant impact on research output was observed.

All variables in the ""barriers and living conditions"" dimension were associated with social position of the participants. Women with a middle or high social position had more favorable living conditions and less barriers for access and showed higher adherence to treatment in comparison with women with a low social position. Additionally, they showed better adherence ""practices"". Meanwhile, in the ""beliefs"" dimension, both groups showed similar trends. Overall, the study concluded that the concept of treatment adherence, as well as research projects and interventions with the goal of improving adherence to HIV/Aids treatment among women ought to incorporate a social perspective based on a gender approach and on the acknowledgement of the critical role played by the social position of women.",Article,"Quintero, M.A.",treatment adherence; HIV/Aids; social position; gender role,treatment adherence;HIV/Aids;social position;gender role;SELF-REPORTED ADHERENCE;ACTIVE ANTIRETROVIRAL THERAPY;HIV-INFECTED PATIENTS;MEDICATION ADHERENCE;GENDER-DIFFERENCES;HEALTH;PREDICTORS;BARRIERS;SUPPORT;DISEASE,Colombia,2-s2.0-78651515882;2-s2.0-78651515882

We evaluated the effectiveness of inferior petrosal sinus sampling (IPSS) in preoperative tumor lateralization and surgical outcomes. Methods Fifty-two consecutive patients with CD and normal magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) were enrolled between 2009 and 2015. Selective catheterization of petrosal sinuses for IPSS was performed. All patients underwent microsurgical dissection, and if a lesion was found, underwent lesion resection. Demographic, biochemical, and intraoperative findings were prospectively collected and reviewed 6 and 12 months postoperatively. Results Forty-five patients (86.4%) had clear lateralization while seven patients had bilateral elevation. Twenty-two patients (42%) were found to have a macroscopic lesion, defined as an abnormal tissue during microsurgical dissection, which was thus resected. No patient had a lesion larger than 4 mm. Eighty-one percent of patients had the lesion where IPSS had been predicted. Hemi-hypophysectomy was performed on twenty-eight patients based on IPSS findings, since no lesion was found. Eighty-six percent of patients with lesion resection had biochemical remission by 12 months. Biochemical remission was documented in 78 and 71% of patients who underwent hemi-hypophysectomy by 6 and 12 months, respectively. Conclusion With careful microsurgical dissection, a macroscopic lesion could be found in a significant number of patients with normal MRI. When no lesion was found, we recommend performing a hemi-hypophysectomy based on IPSS findings, since prediction accuracy was high and remission rates were significant.",Article,"Harker, P.; Feo-Lee, O.; Giraldo-Grueso, M.; Puentes, J.C.",petrosal sinuses sampling; Cushing's disease; tumor lateralization,petrosal sinuses sampling;Cushing's disease;tumor lateralization;DEPENDENT CUSHINGS-SYNDROME;PITUITARY-ADENOMAS;ECTOPIC ACTH;DIAGNOSIS;MANAGEMENT;DISEASE;EXPERIENCE;SECRETION;HORMONE,Colombia,2-s2.0-85026857556

Methods: In the current work, we carried out a meta-analysis of available GWES for IS. Bioinformatics and computational biology analyses were applied to identify enriched functional categories and convergence with other genomic datasets for IS. Results: Three primary datasets were included and in the meta-analyses for GWES and IS, 41 differentially expressed (DE) genes were identified using a random effects model. Thirteen of these genes were downregulated and 28 were upregulated. An analysis of functional categories found a significant enrichment for the Gene Ontology Term ""Inflammatory Response"" and for binding sites for the PAX2 transcription factor. Conclusions: The list of DE genes identified in this meta-analysis of GWES for IS is useful for future genetic and molecular studies, which would allow the identification of novel mechanisms involved in the pathophysiology of IS. Several of the DE genes found in this meta-analysis have known functional roles related to mechanisms involved in the pathophysiology of IS.

Thrombosis develops when the hemostatic system is incorrectly activated due to the unbalance between procoagulant, anticoagulant and fibrinolytic mechanisms allowing the formation of a clot within a blood vessel. The risk factors of this pathology can be acquired or can be genetic. Objectives. To analyze in a Colombian population with diagnosis of venous thrombosis, lipid profile, glucose and homocystein levels, to calculate the alleles and genotypic frequencies of polymorphisms c.699 C>T, c.1080 C>T, c.844ins68 of the cystathionine beta synthase and the c.677 C>T of the methylenetetrahydrofolate reductase (MTHFR) genes. Materials and methods. Thirty three patients and their controls were studied. The biochemical test was carried out by colorimetric methods and immunoassay. In this survey we used the restriction fragments longitude polymorphism (RLFP) technique to identify the polymorphisms mentioned. The association study was performed through the chi square test. Results. We confirmed that gene alterations increase risk for pathology; we found statistically significant differences in the group with hypercholesterolemia in presence of the polymorphism c.699 C>T in the CBS gene, showing a protective effect in the individuals carrying this genetic variation. Likewise, we found a statistical trend for an eventual protective effect of the CBS c.844ins68 polymorphism to venous thrombotic disease. Conclusions.

A random-effect model and generic inverse variance method were used for quantitative data synthesis, sensitivity analysis conducted using the leave-one-out method, and weighted random-effects meta-regression performed to evaluate potential confounders on cystatin C levels.Results: This meta-analysis of data from nine published studies (16 treatment arms) involved a total of 2195 subjects. In a single-arm analysis of clinical trials (without control group; eight studies comprising 14 treatment arms), fibrate therapy increased circulating cystatin C concentrations (WMD: 0.07mg/dL, 95% CI: 0.04, 0.10, p<.001; I-2=82.66%). When the analysis was restricted to randomized controlled trials (four studies comprising six treatment arms), again elevation of circulating cystatin C levels was observed (WMD: 0.06mg/L, 95% CI: 0.03, 0.09, p<.001; I-2=42.98%). Elevated cystatin C levels were only seen with fenofibrate and not with other fibrates.Conclusions: The results suggest that fenofibrate treatment adversely affects cystatin C levels and might partially explain the limited efficacy of fenofibrate in reducing cardiovascular events.Key messageFenofibrate treatment adversely affects cystatin C levels and might partially explain the limited efficacy of fenofibrate in reducing cardiovascular events.",Review,"Sahebkar, A.; Simental-Mendia, L.E.; Pirro, M.; Montecucco, F.; Carbone, F.; Banach, M.; Barreto, G.E.; Butler, A.E.",Fibrates; cystatin C; fenofibrate,Fibrates;cystatin C;fenofibrate;LIPID ASSOCIATION RECOMMENDATIONS;PATIENT-CENTERED MANAGEMENT;RENAL-FUNCTION;FENOFIBRATE TREATMENT;PLASMA HOMOCYSTEINE;RISK-FACTOR;THERAPY;DYSLIPIDEMIA;DISEASE;INHIBITORS,Iran;Mexico;Italy;Poland;Colombia;Chile;Qatar,2-s2.0-85053243854
,,,3,WOS:000565481900005,2021,Increasing of SIgA serum levels may reflect subclinical intestinal involvement in non-radiographic axial and peripheral spondyloarthritis,"Objective The evidence shows that previous infection with enteric pathogens is a requirement to develop pSpA. Based on our previous results, variances on regulation of SIgA might influence SpA activity; thus, the aim of this study was to correlate the levels of SIgA, IgA against some enteric bacteria, and IL-17, IL-21, and IL-6 with clinical features in a group of SpA patients. Methods Twenty-six pSpA, 20 nr-axSpA, 60 healthy volunteers (HV), and 34 patients with inflammatory bowel diseases (IBD) were included. All subjects were assessed to measure SIgA, total and specific IgA for enteric bacteria, and IL-17, IL-21, and IL-6 levels and clinical variables. For SpA patients, the diagnosis was verified 5 years after first evaluation to assess the risk of developing r-axSpA. Results SIgA levels were significantly higher in SpA patients than in HV and IBD (p< 0.0001 andp= 0.047, respectively). However, no differences for SIgA neither total IgA were found among the SpA subtypes (p= 0.624). Only IL-6 was higher in SpA than HV (p= 0.013). An inverse correlation was demonstrated for SIgA and BASFI (r: - 0.45;p= 0.003), BASDAI (r: - 0.39;p= 0.0123), ASDAS-CRP (r: - 0.37;p= 0.014), and ASDAS-ESR (r: - 0.45;p= 0.0021). There was no evidence of risk of developing r-axSpA in patients who previously showed high levels of serum antibodies. Conclusion The results show that pSpA as well as nr-axSpA share a similar SIgA-intestinal involvement independently of a previous infection. This suggests that serum SIgA increases are evidence of subclinical intestinal compromise which could have influence on disease activity but not in this progression.",Article,"Arias, I.; Herrera, D.; Bautista-Molano, W.; Bello-Gualtero, J.M.; De Avila, J.; Salas-Cuestas, F.; Romero-Sanchez, C.",ASDAS; BASDAI; Intestinal disease; Secretory immunoglobulin A (SIgA); Spondyloarthritis,ASDAS;BASDAI;Intestinal disease;Secretory immunoglobulin A (SIgA);Spondyloarthritis;SOCIETY CLASSIFICATION CRITERIA;POLYMERIC IG RECEPTOR;SECRETORY IGA;ANKYLOSING-SPONDYLITIS;REACTIVE ARTHRITIS;TH17 CELLS;DISEASE;INFLAMMATION;ASSOCIATION;ANTIBODIES,Colombia,2-s2.0-85090166275;2-s2.0-85090166275

Postnatally, 2D echocardiographic RV fractional area change (FAC) is used to assess RV global systolic function by calculating the percentage of change in RV area from systole to diastole. Reports on FAC are scarce in prenatal life, and nomograms throughout pregnancy are not available. Our aims were (1) to study prenatal RV FAC feasibility and reproducibility and (2) to construct nomograms for RV FAC and end-diastolic (ED) and end-systolic (ES) RV areas from 18 to 41 weeks of gestation. Methods: Prospective cohort study including 602 low-risk singleton pregnancies undergoing a fetal echocardiography from 18 to 41 weeks of gestation. RV ED and ES areas were measured following standard recommendations for ventricular dimensions and establishing strict landmarks to identify the different phases of the cardiac cycle. RV FAC was calculated as: ([ED area - ES area]/ED area) x 100. RV FAC intra- and inter-observer reproducibility was evaluated in 45 fetuses by calculating the intraclass correlation coefficient (ICC). Parametric regressions were tested to model each parameter against gestational age (GA) and estimated fetal weight (EFW). Results: RV areas and FAC were successfully obtained in similar to 99% of fetuses with acceptable reproducibility throughout gestation (RV ED area inter-observer ICC [95% CI] 0.96 [0.93-0.98], RV ES area 0.97 [0.94-0.98], and FAC 0.69 [0.44-0.83]). Nomograms were constructed for RV ED and ES areas and FAC. RV areas showed a quadratic and logarithmic increase with GA and EFW, respectively. In contrast, RV FAC showed a slight quadratic decrease throughout gestation (mean RV FAC ranged from 36% at 18 weeks of gestation [10-90th centiles: 25-47%, respectively] to 29% at 41 weeks [10-90th centiles: 18-40%, respectively]). The best models for RV areas and FAC were a second-degree polynomial. Conclusions: RV FAC is a feasible and reproducible parameter to assess RV global systolic function in fetal life.

These centers facilitate the training of different professionals, as well as the research at basic, translational and clinical levels. Nevertheless, few reports have described the experience of these centers and their local and/or global impact in the study of IEM. In this paper, we describe the experience of a Colombian reference center for the research, diagnosis, training and education on IEM. During the last 20 years, important advances have been achieved in the clinical knowledge of these disorders, as well as in the local availability of several diagnosis tests. Organic acidurias have been the most frequently detected diseases, followed by aminoacidopathies and peroxisomal disorders. Research efforts have been focused in the production of recombinant proteins in microorganisms towards the development of new enzyme replacement therapies, the design of gene therapy vectors and the use of bioinformatics tools for the understanding of IEM. In addition, this center has participated in the education and training of a large number professionals at different levels, which has contributed to increase the knowledge and divulgation of these disorders along the country.

The methodology included the phytochemical study on the aerial part of P. pesaresanum, the synthesis of some derivatives and the evaluation of the antifungal activity against the fungi Moniliophthora roreri, Fusarium solani and Phytophthora sp. The chemical study allowed the isolation of three benzoic acid derivatives (1-3), one dihydrochalcone (4) and a mixture of sterols (5-7). Seven derivatives (8-14) were synthesized from the main constituents, of which compounds 9, 10, 12 and 14 are reported for the first time. Benzoic acid derivatives showed strong antifungal activity against M. roreri, of which 11 (3.0 +/- 0.8 mu M) was the most active compound with an IC50 lower compared with positive control Mancozeb(R) (4.9 +/- 0.4 mu M). Dihydrochalcones and acid derivatives were active against F. solani and Phytophthora sp., of which 3 (32.5 +/- 3.3 mu M) and 4 (26.7 +/- 5.3 mu M) were the most active compounds, respectively.

Secondary hyperparathyroidism usually improves after renal transplantation. When it becomes persistent, it is associated with deleterious effects on the graft, bone demineralization, fractures, calcifications, and cardiovascular events. In this study we describe the development of cases of severe hyperparathyroidism occurring after renal transplantation. Objective. To describe the behavior of the indicators of bone mineral metabolism in the renal transplantation patient with severe secondary hyperparathyroidism before transplantation, treated with or without parathyroidectomy. Methods. This is a case series study conducted between 2004 and 2017 on renal transplantation patients presenting with PTH > 800 pg/mL or who required pretransplantation parathyroidectomy. Results. We found 36 patients with severe hyperparathyroidism, corresponding to 10.8% of transplantation recipients, with an average age of 54.5 years (+/- 12.35). The median follow-up after transplantation was 128 months (16-159). Fourteen patients underwent parathyroidectomy before transplantation, with a median intact parathyroid hormone at the time of transplantation of 56 (3-382) pg/mL, with more episodes of hypocalcaemia and oral calcium requirement.

Evidence from Costa Rica,"The estimated benefits of malaria eradication have been very different in terms of human capital accumulation. This paper quantifies the impact of malaria eradication in Costa Rica and explores whether precampaign regional characteristics can improve or damage the benefits of a health campaign. There are several results. First, using difference in differences I find that years of education of men and women increased in response to the eradication campaign but that only wages of males increased. Results are robust. Second, worse conditions in the school system and more child employment displaced schooling. Hence, health benefits may not translate into educational gains when the school system characteristics are bad or when the child labor market provides a better investment opportunity than schooling. Third, combining empirical evidence with a simple model, the increase in schooling cannot solely explain the increase in the income of men; however, health improvements explain most of the increase. Finally, the point estimates show that human capital gains were almost completely eliminated when a shortage of funding for eradication led to a resurgence of malaria; this emphasizes the fragility of the estimated benefits.",Article,"Mora-Garcia, C.A.",,SOUTH-AFRICA;EXPOSURE;IMPACT;CHILDHOOD;EDUCATION;DISEASE;GENDER;HEALTH;LABOR,Colombia,2-s2.0-85043531092;2-s2.0-85043531092

This study aimed to compare the disease outcomes of patients with RA, based on their healthcare regime affiliation. Methods A retrospective observational study of Colombian patients with RA in three outpatient services of different regimes: Contributory (CR, workers and their families with a monthly income above a yearly defined threshold, approximately US$ 220, who allocate a percentage of their income to financing the national health fund and to get access to healthcare services), subsidized (SR, a vulnerable population with a monthly income below the threshold, who have access to healthcare through the national health fund; comparable to the USA Medicaid population), and an excellence clinical care center (C3, access to specialized care, regardless of their healthcare affiliation regime). Data were collected from clinical records for 2 years of follow-up and included demographics, lag times between appointments, and time in high disease activity. We used the Mantel-Cox test for the analysis of time to remission/low disease activity. Results A total of 240 patients were included (80 patients per regime). At the start of follow-up, mean age was 53.7 years; 21.6% of patients were men; 79.6% of patients had established RA; 72.9% of patients had high disease activity. Patients in the CR had longer lag times between scheduled appointments (p < 0.0001). During follow-up, SR had the highest proportion of patients with high disease activity. Survival curve analysis showed no significant difference between SR and CR groups (p = 0.2903), but was significantly different compared with the C3 group (p < 0.0001). Median survival in high disease activity was greater in the SR group (293 days), followed by CR (254 days), and finally by C3 (64 days).

Material and methods: A prospective observational study was conducted on 137 patients with clinically localised prostate cancer of low, intermediate or high risk according to the D'Amico classification. All participants underwent radical prostatectomy plus extended pelvic lymphadenectomy in 3 reference centres in Bogota, Colombia, between 2013 and 2014. The following variables were assessed: age, prostate specific antigen levels, Gleason score of the biopsy, probability of lymph node involvement calculated with Partin tables and the histopathology result of the surgical specimen, with the definitive Gleason pattern and the total number of resected and involved lymph nodes per tumour, according to the territory of the dissection. Results: A total of 2,876 lymph nodes were extracted (an average, of 20.99 lymph nodes per patient). There was lymph node involvement in 14 (10.22%) patients. The high-risk and intermediate -risk group presented lymph node metastases in 28.57% and 5.25%, respectively. There was no lymph node involvement in the low-risk group. Of the patients at risk of lymph node involvement (>= 2% according to the Partin tables), 19.40% had lymph node metastases.

Nonallelic homologous recombination (NAHR)-mediated recurrent deletions are responsible for the majority of HNPP and SMS cases; the rearrangement products encompass the key dosage-sensitive genes PMP22 and RAI1, respectively, and result in haploinsufficiency for these genes. Less frequently, nonrecurrent genomic rearrangements occur at this locus. Contiguous gene duplications encompassing both PMP22 and RAI1, i.e., PMP22-RAI1 duplications, have been investigated, and replication-based mechanisms rather than NAHR have been proposed for these rearrangements. In the current study, we report molecular and clinical characterizations of six subjects with the reciprocal phenomenon of deletions spanning both genes, i.e., PMP22-RAI1 deletions. Molecular studies utilizing high-resolution array comparative genomic hybridization and breakpoint junction sequencing identified mutational signatures that were suggestive of replication-based mechanisms. Systematic clinical studies revealed features consistent with SMS, including features of intellectual disability, speech and gross motor delays, behavioral problems and ocular abnormalities. Five out of six subjects presented clinical signs and/or objective electrophysiologic studies of peripheral neuropathy. Clinical profiling may improve the clinical management of this unique group of subjects, as the peripheral neuropathy can be more severe or of earlier onset as compared to SMS patients having the common recurrent deletion. Moreover, the current study, in combination with the previous report of PMP22-RAI1 duplications, contributes to the understanding of rare complex phenotypes involving multiple dosage-sensitive genes from a genetic mechanistic standpoint.",Article,"Yuan, B.; Neira, J.; Gu, S.; Harel, T.; Liu, P.F.; Briceno, I.; Elsea, S.H.; Gomez, A.; Potocki, L.; Lupski, J.R.",,GENOMIC DISORDERS;HEREDITARY NEUROPATHY;PRESSURE PALSIES;HOMOLOGOUS RECOMBINATION;STRUCTURAL VARIATION;DNA REARRANGEMENTS;17P11.2 DELETIONS;DISEASE;PHENOTYPE;DUPLICATION,United States;Colombia,2-s2.0-84978119393

Affected fetuses are exposed to an adverse environment in utero during a critical time of development and may face long-term health consequences such as increased cardiovascular risk in adulthood. Growth restricted fetuses develop remodeled hearts with signs of systolic and diastolic dysfunction. Cardiac adaptations are more evident in early severe cases, but also present in late onset fetal growth restriction.

For this purpose, the bacterium employs an array of adhesins, for example, AlpA. The adhesin A1pA has been proposed as a major adhesin because of its critical role in human stomach colonization. Therefore, understanding how p evolved could be important for the development of new diagnostic strategies.

A possible explanation for this association is the effect of IUGR on cardiovascular structure and function. However, the specific changes observed are not consistent among studies. In this paper, we analyze several sources of heterogeneity within and between studies related to exposure, outcome and co-variables. A broad IUGR definition might include different phenotypes, expressing heterogeneity as an outcome. Outcome heterogeneity may also be the result of the postnatal effect modification that can be explored within studies. In order to do so, it is important to move beyond mean differences between groups, for example using unsupervised, stratified or interaction analysis. Different definitions of IUGR and the inclusion of different postnatal variables as confounders are potential sources of heterogeneity between studies. Researchers should be aware that postnatal variables may play different roles throughout a person's life and are not limited to behave as confounders. Therefore, their inclusion in the statistical model needs to be carefully considered.

One of the most important hypertensive pregnancy disorders is preeclampsia (PE). Lives can be saved, if PE is prevented, or detected early and properly managed. Prevention and detection depend on identifying the risk factors associated with PE, and, as these have been shown vary by population, they should be determined on a population-by-population basis. The following study utilized the nested case-control model to evaluate 45 potential PE risk factors of a cohort in Bogota, Colombia, making it perhaps the most comprehensive study of its kind in Colombia. It found PE to have a statistically significant association with 7 of the 45 factors evaluated: 1) pre-gestational BMI >30 kg/m(2), 2) pregnancy weight gain >12 kg, 3) previous history preeclampsia/eclampsia, 4) previous history of IUGR-SGA (Intrauterine Growth Restriction-Small for Gestational Age), 5) maternal age <20 or >= 35 years (20-34 was not associated), and 6) family history of diabetes. Finally, prenatal consumption of folic acid was found to lower the risk of PE.

There are two strategies for its prevention: Universal prophylaxis, with valganciclovir for 90 days, and anticipated therapy, using weekly viral load surveillance, and therapy only if positive. Meta-analysis directly comparing both strategies have shown them to have similar effectiveness. Objective: To determine which strategy is more cost-effective in intermediate risk patients in Colombia. Materials and methods: We designed a third-party payer perspective decision tree, considering only direct medical costs in 2014 Colombian pesos (COP) (USD$ 1=COP$ 2,000) and a time horizon of one year. The target population was intermediate CMV risk patients (positive receptor). Transition probabilities were extracted from clinical studies, validated with a Delphi expert panel method; procedural costs were obtained from the ISS 2001 manual with a 33% increment based on the Consumer Price Index for 2014, while medication costs were obtained from the official Ministry of Health information system. Results: Universal prophylaxis with valganciclovir was dominant, with lower costs and less probability of infection. The average cost of the first year in anticipated therapy would be COP$ 30,961,290, whereas in the case of universal therapy the cost would be COP$ 29,967,834 (incremental cost of COP$ 993,456).

Acute impairment of kidney function in patients with heart failure and heart transplantation is a frequent condition. However, the impact of the transplant on long-term kidney function remains controversial. Methods. This study describes a cohort of patients who received a heart transplant in a reference hospital between 2005 and 2019. Glomerular filtration rate during follow-up was calculated at 0, 6,12, 24, and 60 months using the Cockcroft-Gault and MDRD (modification of diet in renal disease study) equations. To identify changes we compared glomerular filtration rate (GFR) at baseline with measurements over time after heart transplantation, using a paired t test and a longitudinal model of Generalized Estimating Equations (GEE). Results. Forty-four patients were included. The mean of baseline GFR was 67.9 +/- 1.3 mL/min. A triple immunosuppressive therapy scheme was used with cyclosporine/tacrolimus, mycophenolate mofetil, and steroid, with progressive dose reduction. After adjusting for multiple variables, we found no reduction of GFR over time with the GEE model. There was no significant difference in GFR using Cockcroft-Gault equation at 6 (mean difference [MD] 4.46; confidence interval [CI] - 2.1 to 11.09; P = 0.18), 12 (MD 1.65, CI -4.5 to 7.82; P = 0.59), 36 (MD 0.69; CI -6.04 to 7.43; P = 0.83), and 60 months (MD 0.62; CI -5.5 to 6.79; P = 0.83).

What Clinicians Ignore,"To narrow the gap between the bench and the clinic, healthcare personnel should have a basic understanding of molecular mechanisms ruling cell identity, since it establishes the key differences between health and disease states. Differential gene expression allows for protein synthesis required for the cell's biological function. In this process genes are selected from the entire genome to meet the cell's biological functioning and respond to internal and external stimuli. To this end, first the chromatin must be remodeled for the transcriptional machinery to gain access to DNA sequences coding for particular genes. DNA can then be transcribed into mRNA, followed by different processes leading to mature mRNA leaving the nucleus for protein synthesis in the cytoplasm. Any dysregulation in these processes results in disease. In the beginning of this millennium the human genome project sequenced the whole genome. Surprisingly, one of the main findings was only 2% of the genome represented protein coding sequences, which raised the question about the remainder of the genome and cell identity.

Because of the COVID-19 pandemic, the implementation of political actions to promote a healthy diet and reduce the consumption of ultra-processed foods is a priority, not only to prevent non-communicable diseases (NCDs), but also to reduce the clinical impairment of the persons who suffer them. The political actions that ensure the supply of unprocessed foods of high nutritional value to the markets in a periodic and timely manner and that allow the farmers to continue with their cultivation and harvest activities are a fundamental pillar to mitigate the effects of indirect health negatives derived from the pandemic.

The objective of the present study was to determine the sleep characteristics of a patient undergoing polysomnography (PSG) in three Colombian cities at different altitudes (Bogota, at 2,640 m above sea level [ASL]; Bucaramanga, at 959 m ASL; and Santa Marta, at 15 m ASL). The patient was an obese man with diabetes and suspected OSA. All PSG recordings were scored and interpreted in accordance with American Academy of Sleep Medicine criteria. In Bogota, PSG revealed moderate OSA (an apnea-hypopnea index [AHI] of 21 events/h); in Bucaramanga, PSG revealed increased upper airway resistance (an AHI of 2 events/h); in Santa Marta, PSG revealed mild OSA (an AHI of 7 events/h). The reduction in the AHI was predominantly a reduction in hypopneas and obstructive apneas. The respiratory events were shorter in duration in the city at an intermediate altitude. Given that the AHI varied widely across cities, we can assume that the patient is normal or has moderate OSA depending on the city where he is. Central apneas were found to have no influence on the AHI.",Article,"Castellanos-Ramirez, J.C.; Ruiz, A.J.; Hidalgo-Martinez, P.; Otero-Mendoza, L.",Sleep apnea; obstructive; Polysomnography; Altitude,Sleep apnea;obstructive;Polysomnography;Altitude;MODERATE ALTITUDE;APNEA;DISTURBANCES;ASSOCIATION;PREVALENCE;DISORDERS;DISEASE,Colombia,2-s2.0-85043787507

Periodontal disease affects systemic inflammatory markers, leading to endothelial dysfunction, atherosclerotic plaque instability, dyslipidaemia, and insulin resistance. These conditions can also cause an increase in the blood pressure. Nonsurgical periodontal therapies, such as scaling and root planning, can affect systemic markers of inflammation. We evaluated the effect of scaling and root planning on serum levels of inflammation biomarkers in hypertensive patients. The sample consisted of 19 hypertensive patients with Periodontitis. The patients underwent laboratory tests that included glycaemia, cholesterol, triglycerides and blood count. Blood pressure was measured before periodontal therapy, and the second blood pressure recording was obtained at the re-evaluation appointment. Quantification of peripheral blood cytokines was performed using the Milliplex Inflammation Human Cytokine kit (Interleukin 1-beta, Interleukin-4, Interleukin-6, Interleukin-8, Interleukin-10, Interleukin-12 P70, Interleukin-17A, vascular endothelial growth factor and tumor necrosis factor-alpha). All cytokine levels decreased from the initial examination to reassessment. Cytokines that reflected a statistically significant difference included Interleukin-1 beta and endothelial vascular growth factor (P = .04 and P = .004).

Literature review,"Pathologies of tumor origin are more frequent in the older adult population, however said population has fewer opportunities to access diagnostic studies and therapeutic interventions, not only due to the age and stage of the cancer, but also because they have conditions of aging such as decreased functional reserve, multiple pathologies, cognitive disorders, or lack of social support that impact on the clinical response to the different therapies that exist to treat cancer. In addition to this, the risk of toxicity conferred by the various cancer treatments, which leads to a more careful evaluation of the type of therapy, the dose, and the benefit of starting it. With the discovery of new therapies for cancer management, we not only face the risk of toxicity with traditional chemotherapy, but also the schemes developed in recent times, such as immunotherapy or targeted therapy, which can mainly generate toxicity to a lesser degree. cardiovascular, gastrointestinal and skin hematological. Taking into account the above, an attempt has been made to advance in the prediction of the risk of toxicity to chemo-radiotherapy, counting to date with different models based on clinical and paraclinical calculations, many of these criteria that come out of these tools are derived from the assessment geriatric (GV), we find tools to evaluate functional performance, cognitive status, social support, which provides valuable and comprehensive information for decision-making not only therapeutic, as well as models that include clinical and paraclinical parameters such as the CRASH tool which predicts non-hematological and joint hematological toxicity and the CARG tool that predicts joint toxicity. However, globally, these toxicity risk prediction tools have several limitations, such as the lack of precision when calculating the risk of severe toxicity associated with chemo-radiotherapy, many are not validated, so many studies conclude that models are needed more accurate when predicting such risk.

The largest factories that have historically processed asbestos include five asbestos-cement facilities located in the cities of Sibate (Cundinamarca), Cali (Valle del Cauca), and Barranquilla (Atlantico), and Manizales (Caldas), which has two, as well as a friction products facility in Bogota D.C. An asbestos chrysotile mine has also operated in Colombia since 1980 in Campamento (Antioquia). In the framework of developing the National Asbestos Profile for Colombia, in this study, we estimated the population residing in the vicinity of asbestos processing plants or the mine and, therefore, potentially at risk of disease. Using a geographic information system, demographic data obtained from the last two general population censuses were processed to determine the number of people living within the concentric circles surrounding the asbestos facilities and the mine. In previous studies conducted in different countries of the world, an increased risk of asbestos-related diseases has been reported for people living at different distance bands from asbestos processing facilities. Based on these studies, circles of 500, 1000, 2000, 5000, and 10,000 m radii, centered on the asbestos processing facilities and the mine that operated in Colombia, were combined with the census data to estimate the number of people living within these radii. Large numbers of people were identified. It is estimated that in 2005, at the country level, 10,489 people lived within 500 m of an asbestos processing facility or mine. In 2018, and within a distance of 10,000 m, the number of people was 6,724,677.

The aphasic patients included in the study had a severe semantic disorder or a mild semantic deficit, or only a lexical disturbance. Participants with dementia showed a moderate deterioration in their executive functions and no impairment in their psycholinguistic performance. In this study, we used an idiom-word matching task, administered in two versions. The results indicate dissimilar performance patterns, according to patients' neuropsychological impairment. In particular, patients with a severe semantic disorder showed a poor understanding of the figurative meanings of idioms, especially if those idioms were not fully transparent or opaque. Participants with a mild semantic deficit accessed the non-literal meanings of the idioms showing less difficulty in the case of certain idiomatic expressions. Patients with executive function deficit showed a double interference effect, and although they could activate the figurative and literal meanings of idioms according to the context in which they were presented, it was difficult for them to inhibit those meanings whenever necessary and activate the alternative meaning. This effect was more pronounced the less transparent the idiom was.",Article,"Marulanda-Paez, E.; Igoa-Gonzalez, J.M.",figurative language; idioms; aphasia; dementia,figurative language;idioms;aphasia;dementia;EXPRESSIONS;DISEASE,Colombia;Spain,2-s2.0-85107403816
