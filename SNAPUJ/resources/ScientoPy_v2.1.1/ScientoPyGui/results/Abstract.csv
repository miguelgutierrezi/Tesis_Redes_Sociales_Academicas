5,"Effective communication of task-resource assignment plans comprises several challenges in important fields such as production scheduling and/or project management. Said difficulties result from the cost and sophistication level of most project planning information tools, and from the pedagogic challenge implied in getting people with different educational levels to communicate through such tools. The present work introduces the implementation grounds of a simple information technology development for the construction of Gantt charts as decision making support tools for people or companies that have limited access to sophisticated information technology tools. The implementation and execution of the Visual Basic code with Excel applications are described in detail, as well as the correct use of the Excel solver add-in from VBA macros to solve the implemented mathematical models.",2,0.0,0.0,0.0,2,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,2,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0
6,"Learning difficulties in Education are some of the most important causes of desertion. One solution has been to use learning and teaching tools in virtual learning environments. These tools facilitate the educational process and improve the cognitive processes in students. However, many tools do not consider the students' particular features, difficulties and levels of disability (all these features compose their profile) that may make it harder to learn. The adaptive virtual learning environments assists students to access course content, to interact with activities and to perform assessment processes, based in their characteristics, needs, difficulties and / or disabilities. This paper presents MDALS (acronym for Adaptive Learning Disability Model System) to characterize a disability and to identify potential difficulties that a student may have in their learning process. This system supports the development of virtual environments, providing personalized and / or adapted services, according to the students' context and profile, to assist their learning.",2,0.0,0.0,0.0,2,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,2,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0
7,"There are different philosophical positions about remembering that have studied, among other things, what its epistemic role or its psychological functioning is. However, not much have been said about this matter from philosophy of language. For this reason, we present a logical-semantic analysis that allows us to state that the act of remembering has an expressive function rather than a merely descriptive one. The actions that speakers perform when they talk about their memories go beyond of giving some information that refers to facts and contents about past personal experiences. We explore the pragmatic dimension of that act based on three kinds of memory. Firstly, factual memories with which speakers acquire epistemic and assertional commitments. Secondly, personal memories with which speakers also acquire those commitments but, in addition, evaluate their past from the present and invite others to share that evaluative position. Thirdly, perceptual memories with which speakers also can acquire those commitments, but what they mainly do is to move a content from the past to the present. The analysis shows 1) some essential aspects of the phenomenon of remembering and 2) that its complexity is much greater than that which some epistemic or psychological researches usually recognize.",2,-1.0,0.0,0.0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,2,0,0
8,"This paper discusses the main aspects that drive the design of intelligent tutoring system based virtual learning environments. Most of these virtual learning systems focus on tutor activity and use artificial intelligence techniques. Information about the interaction with these systems is used to create a model that, given the preferences and learning styles of a student, performs an information retrieval process to adapt content delivery to the student, according to his/her particular characteristics (learning style, behavior, performance, and whether the student has a disability or not).",2,0.0,0.0,0.0,2,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,2,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0
