Experimental evidence shows, however, that individuals do not typically behave this way; instead, they tend to strike a balance between self and group interests. From experiments performed in rural Colombia, we found that a regulatory solution for an environmental delimma that standard theory predicts would improve social welfare clearly did not. This occurred because individuals confronted with the regulation began to exhibit less other-regarding behavior and made choices that were more self-interested; that is, the regulation appeared to crowd out other-regarding behavior.

,,,326,WOS:000236776600020,2006,Regional patterns of agricultural land use and deforestation in Colombia,"An expanding human population and associated demands for goods and services continues to exert an increasing pressure on ecological systems. Although the rate of expansion of agricultural lands has slowed since 1960, rapid deforestation still occurs in many tropical countries, including Colombia. However, the location and extent of deforestation and associated ecological impacts within tropical countries is often not well known. The primary aim of this study was to obtain an understanding of the spatial patterns of forest conversion for agricultural land uses in Colombia. We modeled native forest conversion in Colombia at regional and national-levels using logistic regression and classification trees. We investigated the impact of ignoring the regional variability of model parameters, and identified biophysical and socioeconomic factors that best explain the current spatial pattern and inter-regional variation in forest cover. We validated our predictions for the Amazon region using MODIS satellite imagery. The regional-level classification tree that accounted for regional heterogeneity had the greatest discrimination ability. Factors related to accessibility (distance to roads and towns) were related to the presence of forest cover, although this relationship varied regionally. In order to identify areas with a high risk of deforestation, we used predictions from the best model, refined by areas with rural population growth rates of > 2%. We ranked forest ecosystem types in terms of levels of threat of conversion. Our results provide useful inputs to planning for biodiversity conservation in Colombia, by identifying areas and ecosystem types that are vulnerable to deforestation. Several of the predicted deforestation hotspots coincide with areas that are outstanding in terms of biodiversity value. (c) 2005 Elsevier B.V.

Analyzing and reconstructing those historical patterns helps to advance the understanding of the dynamics and persistence of present-day ecosystems. This article explores this reconstruction by identifying and analyzing historic drivers of landscape change for seven periods between 1500 and 2000, and presents historical land use maps showing major trends and impacts on natural ecosystems. Historic land use maps were built using an ecosystem map of 1998 and a ""preclearing"" ecosystem map, by constraining the spatial change of transformed areas using data on accessibility to rivers and roads, elevation, slope, moisture availability, and settlement areas. We estimate the transformed area rose from approximately 15 Mha in 1500 to 42 Mha in 2000, and land use changed from cropping in 1500 to predominantly grazing in 2000. Demographic impacts of colonization and the introduction of cattle were major drivers of change, but rates and trends of land cover change varied between regions and from period to period. The most impacted ecosystems have been the Andean and tropical dry forests, with the most recent trends toward clearing of humid lowland forests, especially in the Amazon and Pacific. Some landscapes have been subject to strong human influence continuously for more than 500 years, whereas others have been transformed for less than thirty years. We discuss the relevance of a historical approach for guiding conservation goals, ecological restoration efforts, and research hypotheses.

Perceived and objective neighborhood environmental characteristics were assessed in a cross sectional multilevel design with 1966 older adults within 50 neighborhoods. Outcome variables included HRQOL (physical and mental dimensions) and SRH measured with the Spanish version of the Short Form 8 (SF-8). Independent variables included perceived and objective neighborhood characteristics as well as self-reported levels of walking. Hierarchical linear and logistic regression models were used for the analysis. Among perceived neighborhood characteristics, safety from traffic was positively associated with both HRQOL dimensions and SRH. Having safe parks was positively associated with the mental dimension of HRQOL and with SRH. Street noise was negatively associated with both HRQOL dimensions. Regarding objective neighborhood characteristics, residing in areas with more than eight percent of land covered by public parks was positively associated with SRH. Objective and perceived neighborhood characteristics could provide insight into potential interventions among older adults from rapidly urbanizing settings in Latin America. (C) 2010 Elsevier Ltd.

,,,124,WOS:000236510700007,2006,Patterns and causes of deforestation in the Colombian Amazon,"Ecosystem information on the Colombian Amazonia is poor in comparison with that on the Brazilian Amazon. We examined patterns of ecosystem diversity, deforestation and fragmentation and provided an estimate on their possible causes through a temporal and spatial analysis of biotic and abiotic data using remote sensing and geographical information systems in six pilot areas covering a total of 4,200,000 ha. Ecological, demographic and socio-economic data were analysed to establish the local conditions. We used a landscape ecology approach to calculate indicators of ecosystem diversity, cover and forest fragmentation such as number of patches, mean patch size, mean shape index and mean nearest neighbour distance. Patterns of deforestation did not run parallel to access roads; instead the typical pattern of unplanned colonization follows the only transportation network existing in many areas in the Colombian Amazonia: rivers. In addition, we have used indicators of human influence such as demographic pressure, quality of life and economic activity indicators. Results show that the extent and rate of change varies between areas depending on population density. Annual deforestation rates were 3.73 and 0.97% in the high population density growth areas of Alto Putumayo and Macarena respectively, and 0.31, 0.23, and 0.01% in the relatively unpopulated areas of indigenous population. These changes are related to land use history as well as to environmental and historical socio-economic factors such as oil extraction, deforestation, cattle ranching or illegal cropping. The current situation in the region suggests that tropical deforestation rates in the Colombian Amazon are substantially higher than those found in previous studies in the rest of the Amazon.

Lessons from experimental economics in the field,"The use of experimental settings to observe human behaviour in a controlled environment of incentives, rules and institutions, has been widely used by the behavioural sciences for sometime now, particularly by psychology and economics. In most cases the subjects are college students recruited for one to two hour decision making exercises in which, depending on their choices, they earn cash averaging US$ 20. In such exercises players face a set of feasible actions, rules and incentives (payoffs) involving different forms of social exchange with other people, and that in most cases involve some kind of externalities with incomplete contracts, such as in the case of common-pool resources situations. Depending on the ecological and institutional settings, the resource users face a set of feasible levels of extraction, a set of rules regarding the control or monitoring of individual use, and sometimes ways of imposing material or non-material costs or rewards to those breaking or following the rules. We brought the experimental lab to the field and invited about two hundred users of natural resources in three Colombian rural villages to participate in such decision making exercises and through these and other research instruments we learned about the ways they solve - or fail to - tragedies of the commons with different social institutions. Further, bringing the lab to the field allowed us to explore some of the limitations of existing models about human behaviour and its consequences for designing policies for conserving ecosystems and improving social welfare. © 2001 Kluwer Academic Publishers.",Article,"Cardenas, Juan Camilo",Co-operation;Collective action;Colombia;Common-pool resources;Crowding-out;Experimental economics;Experiments;Field experiments;Game theory;Institutions;Reciprocity;Regulation;Reputation;Trust,Co-operation;Collective action;Colombia;Common-pool resources;Crowding-out;Experimental economics;Experiments;Field experiments;Game theory;Institutions;Reciprocity;Regulation;Reputation;Trust,Colombia,

Folstein's Mini Mental State Examination (MMSE) is widely used as screening test for cognitive impairment. Objective. To test a Spanish version of the MMSE in a population of high illiteracy rate. Material and methods. Population-based survey of a stratified random sample of urban and rural residents of five regions of Colombia, followed by neurological and neuropsychological evaluation of suspect cases (phase 2). Dementia was diagnosed using DSM-IV criteria. Results. 1,611 subjects age 50 or older filled out both the WHO Protocol for Epidemiologic Studies of Neurological Disorders and a Spanish version of the MMSE; 55.2% of them had three or less years of schooling; 536 individuals with scores below cutoff points were sent to phase 2. Of the population with satisfactory scores in MMSE 366 (34.0%) were evaluated by neurologists to exclude other neurological conditions. Twelve cases of dementia were diagnosed among individuals with scores below cutoff point and one among subjects with high scores. Age-adjusted prevalence was 8.1 per thousand subjects age 50 or over (95% CI: 3.7-12.5); and 34.2 per thousand for ages 75 or over (95% CI: 12.2-56.2). Sensitivity and specificity were 92.3 and 53. 7%; 16 of the 19 questions show significant differences (p< 0.001) according to educational level. A gender gap is significant in low educational levels (p< 0.001) but not in subjects with more than five years of schooling. Conclusions. MMSE scores correlated closely with level of education. Low specificity leads to many non-demented subjects with low educational status requiring further investigation.",Article,"Rosselli, Diego",Aging;Colombia;Dementia/epidemiology;Educational status;Mass screening/methods;Neuropsychology,Aging;Colombia;Dementia/epidemiology;Educational status;Mass screening/methods;Neuropsychology,Colombia,

Nineteen Chilean and thirteen Colombian sediment samples were analyzed in order to determine their content of brorninated flame retardants (BFRs) (including PBDEs and emerging BFRs) as well as UV filters (UV-F). Samples were collected from neighboring aquatic ecosystems highly urbanized and industrialized in Colombia (Magdalena River area) and Chile (Biobio region). Different analytical procedures were applied depending on the selected analytes, based on chromatographic and mass spectrometric methodologies (GC-MS and LC-MS-MS). In general, concentration levels of both BFRs (up to 2.43 and 143 ng g(-1)dw of PBDEs in Chile and Colombia, respectively) and UV-F (nd-2.96 and nd-54.4 ng g(-1) dw in Chile and Colombia, respectively) were in the low range of published data, and the contribution of BFRs was higher than that of UV-F for almost all the sampled sediments.

Design: Prospective cohort. Setting: Ten general hospitals in the four main cities of Colombia. Patients: Consecutive patients admitted in emergency rooms, intensive care units, and general wards from September 1, 2007, to February 29, 2008, with confirmation of infection according to the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention definitions. Interventions: None. Measurements and Main Results: The following information was recorded: demographic, clinical, and microbiologic characteristics; Acute Physiology and Chronic Health Evaluation II and Sequential Organ Failure Assessment scores; requirement for intensive care unit; length of stay; and 28-day all-cause mortality. During a period of 6 months, 2,681 patients were recruited: 69% and 31% with community-acquired and hospital-acquired infections, respectively. The mean age was 55 yrs (SD = 21), 51% were female, and the median length of stay was 10 days (interquartile range, 5-19). The mean Acute Physiology and Chronic Health Evaluation score was 11.5 (SD = 7) and the mean Sequential Organ Failure Assessment score was 3.8 (SD = 3). A total of 422 patients with community-acquired infections (16%) were admitted to the intensive care unit as a consequence of their infection and the median length of stay was 4.5 days in the intensive care unit. At admission, 2516 patients (94%) met at least one sepsis criterion and 1,658 (62%) met at least one criterion for severe sepsis. Overall, the 28-day mortality rates of patients with infection without sepsis, sepsis without organ dysfunction, severe sepsis without shock, and septic shock were 3%, 7.3%, 21.9%, and 45.6%, respectively. In community-acquired infections, the most frequent diagnosis was urinary tract infection in 28.6% followed by pneumonia in 22.8% and soft tissue infections in 21.8%. Within hospital-acquired infections, pneumonia was the most frequent diagnosis in 26.6% followed by urinary tract infection in 20.4% and soft tissue infections in 17.4%. Conclusions: In a general inpatient population of Colombia, the rates of severe sepsis and septic shock are higher than those reported in the literature. The observed mortality is higher than the predicted by the Acute Physiology and Chronic Health Evaluation II score.

,,,82,WOS:000237133000010,2006,"Modelling the conversion of Colombian lowland ecosystems since 1940: Drivers, patterns and rates","In biologically mega-diverse countries that are undergoing rapid human landscape transformation, it is important to understand and model the patterns of land cover change. This problem is particularly acute in Colombia, where lowland forests are being rapidly cleared for cropping and ranching. We apply a conceptual model with a nested set of a priori predictions to analyse the spatial and temporal patterns of land cover change for six 50-100 km(2) case study areas in lowland ecosystems of Colombia. Our analysis included soil fertility, a cost-distance function, and neighbourhood of forest and secondary vegetation cover as independent variables. Deforestation and forest regrowth are tested using logistic regression analysis and an information criterion approach to rank the models and predictor variables. The results show that: (a) overall the process of deforestation is better predicted by the full model containing all variables, while for regrowth the model containing only the auto-correlated neighbourhood terms is a better predictor; (b) overall consistent patterns emerge, although there are variations across regions and time; and (c) during the transformation process, both the order of importance and significance of the drivers change. Forest cover follows a consistent logistic decline pattern across regions, with introduced pastures being the major replacement land cover type. Forest stabilizes at 2-10% of the original cover, with an average patch size of 15.4 (+/- 9.2) ha. We discuss the implications of the observed patterns and rates of land cover change for conservation planning in countries with high rates of deforestation. (c) 2005 Elsevier Ltd.

,,,79,WOS:000282201700001,2010,Mango (Mangifera indica L.) flowering physiology,"Mango flowering is an important physiological event that sets the start of fruit production. Initiation is the first event that takes place for mangoes to flower. Coincident with shoot initiation, induction occurs based on the conditions present at the time of initiation. Numerous studies with mango trees support the existence of a florigenic promoter (FP) that is continuously synthesized in mango leaves and induces flowering. Translocation experiments suggest that the FP is carried from leaves to buds in phloem. Induction appears to be governed by the interaction of the FP and a vegetative promoter (VP). The FP is translocated as far as 100 cm in subtropical conditions and 52 cm in tropical conditions. In the tropics, floral induction occurs in stems that have attained sufficient time in rest since the previous flush. The age of the last flush is the primary factor governing flowering in the tropics as evidenced by experiments in Colombia. Tip pruning is ideal to synchronize vegetative flush events in the canopy. Potassium nitrate (KNO3) has been shown to stimulate flowering in sufficiently mature stems. Tip pruning and foliar applied KNO3 are effective methodologies that induce synchronous flowering especially in Colombia. Cool temperatures are important for mango floral induction under subtropical conditions. Mangoes grown in the low-latitude tropics rely less on low temperature. Soil and leaf analyses should be conducted to evaluate the nutrient status of trees. (C) 2010 Elsevier B.V.

Since nothing is known about the contribution of BRCA1 and BRCA2 germline mutations to hereditary breast/ovarian cancer in the Hispanic population from Colombia, we conducted the first study of 53 breast/ovarian cancer families from this country. Comprehensive BRCA mutation screening was performed using a range of techniques, including DHPLC, SSCP, and PTT, followed by DNA sequencing analysis. Thirteen deleterious germline mutations (24.5%) were identified in 53 families, comprising eight in BRCA1 and five in BRCA2. The two recurrent BRCA1 mutations, 3450 delCAAG and A1708E, accounted for 100% of all BRCA1 mutations identified in this cohort and the recurrent 3034 delACAA BRCA2 mutation for 40% of all BRCA2 mutations. Haplotype analyses suggested that each of these mutations has arisen from a common ancestor. The prevalence of BRCA1 or BRCA2 mutations was 50% in multiple case breast cancer families, and was 33% for the breast-ovarian cancer families. Our findings show that BRCA mutations account for a substantial proportion of hereditary breast/ovarian cancer in Colombia.

Of particular concern for conservation planning are 'biodiversity hotspots' where high concentrations of endemic species undergo rapid loss and fragmentation of habitat. We investigate the deforestation process in Caqueta, a biodiversity hotspot and major colonization front of the Colombian Amazon using multi-temporal satellite imagery of the periods 1989-1996-1999-2002. The probabilities of deforestation and regeneration were modeled against soil fertility, accessibility and neighborhood terms, using logistic regression analysis. Deforestation and regeneration patterns and rates were highly variable across the colonization front. The regional average annual deforestation rate was 2.6%, but varied locally between -1.8% (regeneration) and 5.3%, with maximum rates in landscapes with 40-60% forest cover and highest edge densities, showing an analogous pattern to the spread of disease. Soil fertility and forest and secondary vegetation neighbors showed positive and significant relationships with the probability of deforestation. For forest regeneration, soil fertility had a significant negative effect while the other parameters were marginally significant. The logistic regression models across all periods showed a high level of discrimination power for both deforestation and forest regeneration, with ROC values > 0.80. We document the effect of policies and institutional changes on the land clearing process, such as the failed peace process between government and guerillas in 1999-2002, which redirected the spread of deforestation and increased forest regeneration. The implications for conservation in biologically rich areas, such as Caqueta are discussed.

Materials and Methods: In a double blind clinical trial, 80 critically ill adult patients were randomized to hyperproteic hypocaloric or to isocaloric enteral nutrition; all patients completed follow-up of at least 4 days. Prescribed caloric intake was: Hyperproteic hypocaloric enteral nutrition (15 kcal/kg with 1.7 g/kg of protein) or isocaloric enteral nutrition (25 kcal/kg with 20% of the calories as protein). The main outcome was the differences in delta SOFA at 48 h. Secondary outcomes were intensive care unit (ICU) length of stay, days on ventilator, hyperglycemic events, and insulin requirements. Results: There were no differences in SOFA score at baseline (7.5 (standard deviation (SD) 2.9) vs 6.7 (SD 2.5) P = 0.17). The total amount of calories delivered was similarly low in both groups (12 kcal/kg in intervention group vs 14 kcal/kg in controls), but proteic delivery was significantly different (1.4 vs 0.76 g/kg, respectively P ≤ 0.0001). The intervention group showed an improvement in SOFA score at 48 h (delta SOFA 1.7 (SD 1.9) vs 0.7 (SD 2.8) P = 0.04) and less hyperglycemic episodes per day (1.0 (SD 1.3) vs 1.7 (SD 2.5) P = 0.017).

In this article, we show how, under specific practices of state territorialization, conservation becomes both the means and reasons for violence. Based on ethnographic research in Colombia's emblematic Tayrona National Natural Park, we detail how both the war on drugs and tourism promotion shape these state practices, and how they have translated into everyday, yet powerful, means of dispossession in the name of conservation. By analyzing the effects of the production of peasants as environmental predators, illegal occupants and collateral damage, we show how official conservation strategies have justified local communities' political and material erasure, and how they have resulted in the destruction of their lived ecologies and the erosion of their livelihood strategies.

Savannas, which cover approximately 269 million ha in South America, play a major role in the global carbon cycle. They are affected by increasing human pressures and global climate change. Using satellite data, this study quantifies vegetation burning in the Colombian Llanos savannas for the period 2000-2008, and analyzes how fire spatial pattern, frequency and extent vary with ecosystem type, land tenure and rainfall. On average 2.75 +/- 0.5 million ha (24 +/- 4.2%) of the savannas burn each year. Burned area is highly variable, with 3.4 million ha burned in 2002-2003 and < 1.9 million ha in 2005-2006. However, during the 2000-2008 period near of 3.7 million ha (33.5%) of the savannas never burned. Compared with the average 8-10 years of fire return time for the tropics and subtropics, these savannas burn twice as often. In addition, the average burn size figure for tropical and subtropical grassland savannas (with < 5% trees) of 7000 ha (median 5000 ha), is about seven times the average burned patch size we found in our study. Fires predominate in the well-drained high plain savannas, lowest figures occurring along the Andean foothills, in forested areas and in pasture and croplands. Annual proportion burned varies with land tenure, being highest in National Parks. This study is the first complete regional map of fire disturbance in a South American savanna. This detailed regional data provides a unique opportunity for increasing the accuracy of global carbon emission calculations.",Article,"Romero-Ruiz, M.; Etter, A.; Sarmiento, A.; Tansey, K.",burned area; Colombia; fire; Llanos Orientales; Modis; satellite,burned area;Colombia;fire;Llanos Orientales;Modis;satellite;BIOMASS;CARBON;PRODUCTIVITY;VEGETATION;FREQUENCY;PATTERNS;RORAIMA;CLIMATE;COVER,United Kingdom;Colombia,2-s2.0-77954158821
,,,57,WOS:000239004700005,2006,Characterizing a tropical deforestation wave: a dynamic spatial analysis of a deforestation hotspot in the Colombian Amazon,"Tropical deforestation is the major contemporary threat to global biodiversity, because a diminishing extent of tropical forests supports the majority of the Earth's biodiversity. Forest clearing is often spatially concentrated in regions where human land use pressures, either planned or unplanned, increase the likelihood of deforestation. However, it is not a random process, but often moves in waves originating from settled areas. We investigate the spatial dynamics of land cover change in a tropical deforestation hotspot in the Colombian Amazon. We apply a forest cover zoning approach which permitted: calculation of colonization speed; comparative spatial analysis of patterns of deforestation and regeneration; analysis of spatial patterns of mature and recently regenerated forests; and the identification of local-level hotspots experiencing the fastest deforestation or regeneration. The colonization frontline moved at an average of 0.84 km yr(-1) from 1989 to 2002, resulting in the clearing of 3400 ha yr(-1) of forests beyond the 90% forest cover line. The dynamics of forest clearing varied across the colonization front according to the amount of forest in the landscape, but was spatially concentrated in well-defined 'local hotspots' of deforestation and forest regeneration. Behind the deforestation front, the transformed landscape mosaic is composed of cropping and grazing lands interspersed with mature forest fragments and patches of recently regenerated forests. We discuss the implications of the patterns of forest loss and fragmentation for biodiversity conservation within a framework of dynamic conservation planning.",Article,"Etter, A.; McAlpine, C.; Phinn, S.; Pullar, D.; Possingham, H.P.",Amazon; Colombia; deforestation; forest cover zones; local hotspots; spatial pattern; tropical forests; unplanned colonization; zoning,Amazon;Colombia;deforestation;forest cover zones;local hotspots;spatial pattern;tropical forests;unplanned colonization;zoning;LAND-COVER CHANGE;LANDSCAPE DYNAMICS;FOREST BIOMASS;PATTERNS;RATES;AGE,Australia;Colombia,2-s2.0-33745807254

All four species show positive correlations between patch size (tree diameter at breast height; DBH) and subgroup size (maximum number of individuals from the focal group feeding at the same time), but the determination coefficients are very low and this relationship does not seem to influence strongly the actual size of the groups. Ateles showed the weakest correlation between patch size and feeding party size, and their fission-fusion sociality is best explained as a mechanism to reduce intragroup competition rather than to adjust the subgroup size to the availability of patches.

This organism can be misidentified as Candida haemulonii, Candida famata, Candida catenulata, or Rhodotorula glutinis by phenotypic approaches. Matrix-assisted laser desorption/ionization time-of-flight mass spectrometry (MALDI-TOF MS) and DNA sequence analysis using internal transcribed spacer rDNA bar-coding provide an accurate identification. Case reports: Three cases of C. auris infection in patients with risk factors for fungal infection (one admitted to the intensive care unit, one with lymphoma, and one with HIV; all three with previous antibiotic use) are reported; these infections were not epidemiologically related. Yeast isolates were recovered from blood, ocular secretion, and bronchoalveolar lavage and were misidentified as C. catenulata and Candida albicans by the phenotypic MicroScan method. The isolates were confirmed to be C. auris by means of MALDI-TOF MS and DNA sequence analysis. Antifungal susceptibility testing was performed on these C. auris isolates, which exhibited high minimum inhibitory concentrations to triazoles and amphotericin B. One patient survived and the other two died. Only one of these deaths was related to fungemia. Conclusions: C. auris is an emerging and opportunistic multidrug-resistant human pathogen. It is necessary to strengthen measures to achieve an accurate and quick identification and also to avoid its dissemination. This will require improvements in health and infection control measures, as well as the promotion of antifungal stewardship in healthcare facilities. (c) 2018 The Author(s).

Design/methodology/approach - This is a multiple-case study in six enterprises that use the IR framework. The selected enterprises, all of which were located in either Bogota or Medellin, were Argos, EEB, EPM, ISA, Nutresa and Ocensa. The authors conducted individual interviews of reporters and performed a documentary analysis. Findings - The few Colombian firms that use the IR framework all have ambitious expansion goals in the medium term. The main reason for the adoption of the IR framework in these firms is that it facilitates access to resources from new foreign investors. Research limitations/implications - Since the framework was published recently, only a few Colombian firms follow it, and several of them do not apply all of its components. In the future, there will be more reports and a higher level of framework application. Practical implications - In the firms studied, the IR framework is an important tool to support the search strategies of new sources of financial capital. Social implications - If the use of the International Integrated Reporting Council (IIRC) framework were to diminish the application of the GRI, firms would be less likely to evaluate the impact of their activities on numerous stakeholders (other than shareholders).

To assess and analyze the associations between adherence to treatment and social position in women living with HIV/AIDS. Method. A cross-sectional, descriptive, correlational study among 269 Colombian women was conducted. Participants completed three questionnaires: a socio-demographic and clinical characteristics survey, a treatment adherence scale, and a social position survey. Results. Women of low social position had a significantly higher probability of low treatment adherence (OR = 5.651, P < 0.0001), and the majority of social position variables measured had a significant effect on adherence. A general model considering the variables ""type of national health care plan"" (""contributive,"" ""subsidized,"" or, in the case of vinculadas or the uninsured, ""none""); ""having HIV-positive children""; and ""level of viral load"" was statistically reliable in predicting study participants' treatment adherence. Membership in the subsidized plan or being uninsured had a greater effect on the probability of low adherence than membership in the contributive plan (OR = 3.478, P < 0.0001). Univariate regression analyses confirmed that women with HIV-positive children and a viral load = 400 copies/ml were more likely to have low adherence than women without those characteristics (OR = 2.395, P = 0.0274 and OR = 2.178, P = 0.0050, respectively). Conclusions. Improving women's adherence to HIV/AIDS treatment in Colombia would require eliminating barriers to national health care system and comprehensive health care services and implementing programs that take into account women's role as maternal caregivers The findings underscore the need to integrate variables related to gender inequality and social position in treatment adherence analysis, as advocated in the social determinants of health approach.",Article,"Arrivillaga, M.; Ross, M.; Useche, B.; Alzate, M.L.; Correa, D.",Patient compliance; HIV; AIDS; gender identity; Colombia,Patient compliance;HIV;AIDS;gender identity;Colombia;HIV-INFECTED PATIENTS;QUALITY-OF-LIFE;ANTIRETROVIRAL THERAPY;EPIDEMIOLOGY;SUPPORT;CARE;MEN,Colombia;United States,2-s2.0-77249155245

Interventions at the household level require the diagnosis of nutritional status among family members. The aim of this study was to describe the prevalence and patterns of various anthropometric typologies over a decade in Colombia using a novel approach that considers all children in the household as well as the mother. This approach also allows identifying a dual burden of malnutrition within a household, where one child may be overweight and another one undernourished. Methods: This study used data from the Demographic and Health Survey and the Colombian National Nutrition Survey [2000 n = 2,876, 2005 n = 8,598, and 2010 n = 11,349].Four mutually exclusive household (HH) anthropometric typologies -normal, undernourished, overweight/obese,anddual burden- were created. Anthropometric information of height-for-age Z-scores (HAZ) and body-mass-index-for-age Z-scores (BMIz) in children under the age of 5 y, and on body mass index (BMI) in mothers, 18-49 y was used. Results: Prevalence of overweight/obese HHs increased between 2000 (38.2%) and 2010 (43.1%) (p < 0.05), while undernourished and dual burden HHs significantly decreased between 2005 (13.7% and 10.6%, respectively) and 2010 (3.5% and 5.1%, respectively) (p < 0.05). A greater increase of overweight/obesity was observed for the lowest quintile of wealth index (WI), with an increase of almost 10% between 2000 and 2010, compared to 2% and 4% for the fourth and highest WI, respectively. Although in 2010 there is still a higher prevalence of overweight/obesity HHs in urban areas (43.7%), the prevalence of overweight/obesity HHs in rural areas increased sharply between 2000 (34.3%) and 2010 (41.6%) (p < 0.05).Conclusion: The observed prevalence of dual burden households was not different from the expected prevalence. Results from this study indicate that although overweight/obesity continues to be more prevalent among high-income Colombian households, it is growing at a faster pace among the most economically disadvantaged.",Article,"Unknown.; Unknown.; Gomez, Luis F.; Unknown.; Haire-Joshu, Debra.; Sarmiento, Olga L.; Unknown.; Unknown",Colombia;Dual burden;Malnutrition;Nutrition transition;Obesity;Overweight;Stunting,Colombia;Dual burden;Malnutrition;Nutrition transition;Obesity;Overweight;Stunting,United States;Colombia;Colombia;United States;United States;United States;United States,

Only very general data on the extent and impacts of the transformation processes that have affected ecosystems in Colombia are available to date. This study analyzes the transformation of forests in part of the Eastern Colombian Andes, using the landscape ecological approach, with remote sensing, fieldwork, and GIS. There are two levels of analysis: A regional level (1:500,000) covering 4.1 million ha and a subregional level (1:50,000) covering 225,000 ha. The former covers the central portion of the East-Andean Cordillera, where the remaining forest and paramo areas were quantified and their spatial distribution analyzed. The subregional analysis level is located in the Middle Chicamocha Watershed. The effects of human activities on the ecosystems were analyzed, taking current farming systems into consideration. The historical human impact in the region has been intense, especially in the drier parts of the study area. At the regional level, only 22% of the original forests remain, of which 28.7% are located in the national parks. In the subregional study area, only 7.6% remain, mainly at altitudes of more than 3000 m. Of five identified forest types, the two with considerable covered areas were the High-Andean Polylepis Forests (33.6%) and the High-Andean mixed forests (35.1%). The original land cover of the sub-Andean dry forests has been almost totally replaced by seminatural shrublands, pastures, crops, and severely degraded areas. The largest fragments are Andean mixed forests and the Andean oak forests, with sizes up to 866 and 1182 ha. Of 19 identified farming systems at the subregional level, only 5 include substantial proportions of their original forest covers.",Article,"Etter, Andres.; Unknown",Biodiversity;Colombia;Eastern Andes;Farming systems;Forest remnants;Landscape change;Landscape ecology;Tropical mountains,Biodiversity;Colombia;Eastern Andes;Farming systems;Forest remnants;Landscape change;Landscape ecology;Tropical mountains,Colombia,

,,,43,WOS:000227860700018,2005,Modeling the age of tropical moist forest fragments in heavily-cleared lowland landscapes of Colombia,"Increasingly, large areas of native tropical forests are being transformed into a mosaic of human dominated land uses with scattered mature remnants and secondary forests. In general, at the end of the land clearing process, the landscape will have two forest components: a stable component of surviving mature forests, and a dynamic component of secondary forests of different ages. As the proportion of mature forests continues to decline, secondary forests play an increasing role in the conservation and restoration of biodiversity. This paper aims to predict and explain spatial and temporal patterns in the age of remnant mature and secondary forests in lowland Colombian landscapes. We analyse the age distributions of forest fragments, using detailed temporal land cover data derived from aerial photographs. Ordinal logistic regression analysis was applied to model the spatial dynamics of mature and secondary forest patches. In particular, the effect of soil fertility, accessibility and auto-correlated neighbourhood terms on forest age and time of isolation of remnant patches was assessed. In heavily transformed landscapes, forests account for approximately 8% of the total landscape area, of which three quarters are comprised of secondary forests. Secondary forest growth adjacent to mature forest patches increases mean patch size and core area, and therefore plays an important ecological role in maintaining landscape structure. The regression models show that forest age is positively associated with the amount of neighbouring forest, and negatively associated with the amount of neighbouring secondary vegetation, so the older the forest is the less secondary vegetation there is adjacent to it. Accessibility and soil fertility also have a negative but variable influence on the age of forest remnants. The probability of future clearing if current conditions hold is higher for regenerated than mature forests. The challenge of biodiversity conservation and restoration in dynamic and spatially heterogeneous landscape mosaics composed of mature and secondary forests is discussed. (c) 2004 Elsevier B.V.

Nevertheless, very few studies have dealt with the problem of the grabbing and concentration of resources from an ethnographic perspective that would make it possible to illustrate the different ways in which dispossession takes place, as well as its concrete mechanisms and effects in particular historical, geographic and political contexts. This article makes a critical contribution to the relevant literature. Based on the specific case of the area of Montes de Maria, located in the Caribbean region of Colombia, it shows how the violent forms of dispossession are produced and maintained by everyday dynamics. Through the analysis of i) the imagined geographies of the region, ii) the implementation of development projects, iii) the processes of privatization of water resources, and iv) the configuration of spaces of fear, this study illustrates how the landscapes of everyday dispossession in the region are produced.

Nine HBV genotypes (A to I) have been described. The geographical distribution of HBV genotypes is not completely understood due to the limited number of samples from some parts of the world. One such example is Colombia, in which few studies have described the HBV genotypes. In this study, we characterized HBV genotypes in 143 HBsAg-positive volunteer blood donors from Colombia. A fragment of 1306 bp partially comprising HBsAg and the DNA polymerase coding regions (S/POL) was amplified and sequenced. Bayesian phylogenetic analyses were conducted using the Markov Chain Monte Carlo (MCMC) approach to obtain the maximum clade credibility (MCC) tree using BEAST v.1.5.3. Of all samples, 68 were positive and 52 were successfully sequenced. Genotype F was the most prevalent in this population (77%) - subgenotypes F3 (75%) and Fib (2%). Genotype G (7.7%) and subgenotype A2 (15.3%) were also found. Genotype G sequence analysis suggests distinct introductions of this genotype in the country. Furthermore, we estimated the time of the most recent common ancestor (TMRCA) for each HBV/F subgenotype and also for Colombian F3 sequences using two different datasets: (i) 77 sequences comprising 1306 bp of S/POL region and (ii) 283 sequences comprising 681 bp of S/POL region. We also used two other previously estimated evolutionary rates: (i) 2.60 x 10(-4) s/s/y and (ii) 1.5 x 10(-5) s/s/y.

These animals represented all of the C. albifrons's taxa described by Hershkovitz (1949) in Colombia and Peru (10 out of 13 subspecies are described by this author). The sequences analyzed demonstrate the existence of three well defined groups in northern Colombia (trans-Andean): malitosus, versicolor-pleei-cesarae and leucocephalus. They arose from at least, three distinct migrations from different Amazonian groups. Five different Amazonian and Eastern Llanos C albifrons's groups (I, II, III, IV, and V) were also found. In many Amazonian localities, some of these groups live in sympatry probably by secondary expansion after their respective formations. Amazonian group I is closely related to the versicolor-pleei-cesarae group, malitosus is closely related to Amazonian group V, while leucocephalus is closely related to Amazonian group IV. Nevertheless, our genetic analysis could not resolve the genetic relationships among the main C albifrons groups. The p-statistic applied to the median-joining network yielded that the major part of the temporal splits estimated occurred in the Pleistocene, reinforcing the importance of the Pleistocene refugia during the evolution of C. albifrons.

The results of this study indicate six primary themes. First, the levels of gene diversity were very high. Second, the majority of the loci analyzed showed an absence of Hardy-Weinberg equilibrium, probably due to the Wahlund effect (= population subdivision). Third, several microsatellite loci showed significant heterogeneity between the two supposed subspecies in the country. Nevertheless, gene flow was present between them, and heterogeneity was relatively low, although the assignment analyses showed good classification of the jaguars studied into their respective subspecies. Fourth, the long-term historical effective population sizes were calculated through a maximum likelihood procedure for single and multi-step mutation models. Fifth, seven out of twelve DNA microsatellites studied significantly deviated from a single-step mutation model.

The Andean and Caribbean regions presented the highest levels of anthropic impact, remaining stable over time. Hotspots of change were mainly located in the following regions: Andean (Antioquia, Cauca and Valle del Cauca states), Amazon (Amazonas, parts of Meta, Guaviare and Putumayo states) and Orinoco (Casanare and parts of Meta and Vichada states). In addition, ecosystems that under the IUCN ecosystem risk categories are Critically Endangered (CR) and Vulnerable (VU) were the most affected by a high level of human impact.

Though a harmonious balance between the communities’ subsistent activities and nature was maintained for centuries, the appearance of modern modes of resource extraction has negatively affected the environment, especially the water resources. The Driver-Pressure-State- Impact-Response (DPSIR) framework was used to analyze water quality problems within this community council. The DPSIR analysis revealed that agriculture, mining, logging and infrastructure development constitute important sectoral drivers with some contribution from tourism and fisheries. Pressures included inputs of organic matter, sediment, nutrients and chemical contaminants to the Dagua river, and to the Bay of Buenaventura. These produced corresponding State changes in the water bodies. Impacts on human welfare were poor public health, reduced food and water security, economic loss and some displacement. Societal Responses included public protests and campaigns, legal actions and policy changes for improved governance. As a future policy option, the formation of community-based water resources management is recommended. Though DPSIR was able to link cause-effect relations, further empirical research on these water bodies is necessary to fill in existing gaps in the data set, particularly for public health threatening contaminants.",Article,"Unknown.; Ortiz-Guerrero, Cesar E.; Unknown.; Unknown.; Unknown",Alto and Medio Dagua;Colombia;Community-based water resources management;DPSIR;Social–Ecological systems,Alto and Medio Dagua;Colombia;Community-based water resources management;DPSIR;Social–Ecological systems,Ethiopia;Colombia;Portugal;Norway;Spain,

Aims To estimate the prevalence of frailty and sarcopenia among older adults in Colombia and identify variables associated with these conditions. Methods Data come from the ""Salud Bienestar y Enve-jecimiento'' (SABE) Bogota 'Study, a cross-sectional study conducted in 2012 in Bogota', Colombia. Sociodemographic, health, cognitive and anthropometric measures were collected from 2000 community-dwelling adults aged 60 years and older. Frailty variable was created using the Fried phenotype and sarcopenia following the European Working Group on Sarcopenia in Older People algorithm. Logistic regression analyses were used to identify factors associated with frailty and sarcopenia. Results A total of 135 older adults are frail (9.4 %), while 166 have sarcopenia (11.5 %). Older age and female gender have a significant association with both conditions (Frailty: Age OR 1.05, 95 % CI 1.03-1.06, Gender OR 1.44, 95 % CI 1.12-1.84; Sarcopenia: Age 1.04, 95 % CI 1.02-1.07, Gender OR 1.51, 95 % CI 1.05-2.17). Depression was also significantly associated with frailty (OR 1.17, 95 % CI 1.12-1.22), while smoking was significantly associated with sarcopenia (OR 2.38, 95 % CI 1.29-4.37). Finally, higher function, measured by independence in IADL (Instrumental Activities of Daily Living) was significantly associated with less frailty (OR 0.74, 95 % CI 0.64-0.86). Education, higher number of comorbidities, better MMSE score, activities of daily living disability and alcohol consumption were not significantly associated with frailty or sarcopenia. Conclusions Frailty, sarcopenia and multimorbidity are overlapping, yet distinct conditions in this sample. There are potentially reversible factors that are associated with frailty and sarcopenia in this sample.

To assess the change in five health equity dimensions for the Colombian health system: health condition, social health insurance coverage, health services utilization, quality, and health expenditure. Methods. A common standardization methodology was used to assess equity in countries in the western hemisphere. Data come from the Colombian Life Quality Survey. After indirect standardization, concentration indices and horizontal inequity were estimated. A decomposition analysis was developed. Aggregate household monthly expenditure per equivalent adult was considered as the standard of living. Results. Results show important progress in equity with regard to social health insurance affiliation, access to medicine and curative services, and perception of the quality of health care service. Important gaps persist, which affect poorer populations, especially their perception of having a bad health condition and their access to preventive medical and dental services. Conclusions. The Colombian model needs to advance in implementing preventive public health strategies to cope with increasing demand concomitant with increased social insurance coverage. The population's access to total services in cases of chronic illness and oral health services must increase and benefit plans must be integrated while preserving the recorded achievements in equity.

The Colombian government's launching of a transitional justice process in the midst of armed conflict has generated a complex situation displaying both conflict and post-conflict characteristics. The progressive Constitutional Court rulings on internal displacement, in particular the gender-sensitive Auto 092, constitute an attempt to bring together humanitarian interventions and transitional justice measures in a rights-based framework. However, the national government is reluctant to adopt them fully and local realities still hamper their integrated implementation. Displaced women, therefore, remain in an especially vulnerable position. This paper argues that gender-sensitive humanitarian interventions must take into account all of these complexities of scale and political process in order to make legal frameworks more effective at the local level. In these contexts, interventions should pay particular attention to strategies that contribute to transforming pre-existing gender regimes.",Article,"Meertens, D.",Colombia; gender; humanitarian interventions; legal frameworks; local contexts; transitional justice,Colombia;gender;humanitarian interventions;legal frameworks;local contexts;transitional justice,Colombia,2-s2.0-77951703702

These strains were isolated from 13 agricultural soils and grouped according to rep-PCR genomic fingerprinting into 11 major clusters, which showed biogeographic patterns. Three clusters (54 strains) belonged to the genus Arthrobacter, seven clusters (28 strains) were similar to the genus Nocardioides and only one strain was a gram-negative from the genus Ancylobacter. PCR assays for the detection of the genes atzA, B, C, D, E, F and trzN conducted with each of the 83 strains revealed that 82 strains (all gram positive) possessed trzN, 74 of them possessed the combination of trzN, atzB and atzC, while only the gram-negative strain had atzA. A similar PCR assay for the two analogous genes, atzA and trzN, responsible for the first step of atrazine degradation, was performed with DNA extracted directly from the enrichment cultures and microcosms spiked with atrazine. In these assays, the gene trzN was detected in each culture, while atzA was detected in only six out of 13 soils.

We evaluated the effects of habitat patch size and matrix type on diversity, isolation, and dispersal of ithomiine butterflies in forest fragments surrounded by coffee agroecosystems in the Colombian Andes. Because ithomiines prefer a shaded understory, we expected the highest diversity and abundance in large fragments surrounded by shade coffee and the lowest in small fragments surrounded by sun coffee. We also thought shade coffee would favor butterfly dispersal and immigration into forest patches. We marked 9675 butterflies of 39 species in 12 forest patches over a year. Microclimate conditions were more similar to the forest interior in the shade-coffee matrix than in the sun-coffee matrix, but patch size and matrix type did not affect species richness and abundance in forest fragments. Furthermore, age structure and temporal recruitment patterns of the butterfly community were similar in all fragments, independent of patch size or matrix type. There were no differences in the numbers of butterflies flying in the matrices at two distances from the forest patch, but their behavior differed. Flight in the sun-coffee matrix was rapid and directional, whereas butterflies in shade-coffee matrix flew slowly. Seven out of 130 recaptured butterflies immigrated into patches in the shade-coffee matrix, and one immigrated into a patch surrounded by sun coffee. Although the shade-coffee matrix facilitated movement in the landscape, sun-coffee matrix was not impermeable to butterflies. Ithomiines exhibited behavioral plasticity in habitat use and high mobility. These traits favor their persistence in heterogeneous landscapes, opening opportunities for their conservation.

Female sexual dysfunction (FSD) is a multifactorial entity and an underestimated problem with an overall prevalence between 20% and 50%. Prevalence can change according to the diagnostic criteria used, data collection, and others such as psychological and cultural factors. Population studies of FSD are limited, both in Colombia and in other countries. Nevertheless, because of the prevalence found in other studies, FSD can be considered a public health issue that affects the quality of life of women who suffer from it and their partners. Aim. To determine the prevalence of FSD and its correlation with the hormonal profile in female outpatients and female staff at San Jose Hospital (Bogota, Colombia). Methods. We performed a cross-sectional study with endocrine measurements. Main Outcome Measures. The prevalence of FSD according to the Female Sexual Function Index (FSFI) cutoff points, and androgenic deficiency defined as women with a proportion of free testosterone below 2%. Demographic characteristics, medical history survey, FSFI, and a hormonal profile that included follicle stimulating hormore (FSH), luteinizing hormone (LH), prolactin, estrone, estradiol, sulphate and total dehydroepiandrosterone, androstenedione, sex hormone binding globulin, and total testosterone. Results. Fifty (49.5%; 95% confidence interval [CI]: 39.4-59.6%) out of 101 participants met the criteria for FSD; in those women with sexual activity in the past 4 weeks, the prevalence of FSD was 37.8% (95% CI: 27.3-49.1%). In the hormone evaluation sample, 29 out of 32 women with sexual activity in the past 4 weeks met the criteria for FSD. Our results suggest that there is independence between the FSFI scores and the proportion of free testosterone. Conclusions.

In this analysis of three areas in Colombia, Mexico, and Argentina, we analyzed the local perceptions of the social and environmental challenges faced by these social-ecological systems and how these challenges and drivers affect their resilience. To do this, we combined prospective structural analysis to unravel stakeholders' perceptions of each system's functioning along with network analysis to assess resilience. We identified external variables as the most influential variables in the Colombian and Argentine cases. In the Mexican case, larger influence is exerted by internal variables, particularly those linked to the governance system. The case study analysis revealed that the community-based natural resource management approach needs external support and recognition to work effectively. In the Argentine and Colombian cases, megaprojects were perceived as controllers with medium or strong influence but low dependence. The use of ancestral knowledge (Colombia), the history of land use (Mexico), and the history of the artisanal fishery (Argentina) were all perceived as common challenges to community-based natural resource management. In terms of social-ecological resilience, framed within the three-dimensional model of the adaptive cycle, all three social-ecological systems were considered to be highly connected and resilient but with different degrees of capacity or cumulative potential.",Article,"Delgado-Serrano, M.D.; Oteros-Rozas, E.; Vanwildemeersch, P.; Ortiz-Guerrero, C.; London, S.; Escalante, R.",Argentina; Colombia; common-pool resources; environmental challenges; governance; Mexico; network analysis; Ostrom; prospective structural analysis; social-ecological resilience,Argentina;Colombia;common-pool resources;environmental challenges;governance;Mexico;network analysis;Ostrom;prospective structural analysis;social-ecological resilience;ADAPTIVE CAPACITY;LANDSCAPE CONNECTIVITY;MULTILEVEL GOVERNANCE;FRAMEWORK;RESILIENCE;SUSTAINABILITY;SCALE;COMANAGEMENT;INSTITUTIONS,Spain;Denmark;Colombia;Argentina;Mexico,2-s2.0-84953318647

We analyzed secondary forest and shrubland dynamics over 30 years (1985-2015) in a densely populated area of the Colombian Andes using satellite and biophysical data. We performed a land-cover change analysis, assessed landscape fragmentation, and applied regression models to evaluate the effects of environmental and geographical correlates with the observed forest transitions. Forest cover area increased during the 30 year-span, due mostly to forest regrowth in areas marginal for agriculture, especially during the first half of the study period. However, a high dynamic of both forest regrowth and clearing near urban centers and roads was observed. Soil fertility turned out to be a key correlate of both forest recovery and deforestation. Secondary forests, < 30 years old represent the most fragmented component. Our findings reflect the complexity of the processes occurring in highly transformed and densely populated regions. Overall, this study provides elements for a better understanding of the factors driving land cover change near large urban areas, and raises new iideas for further research.",Article,"Rubiano, K.; Clerici, N.; Norden, N.; Etter, A.",secondary forests; landscape fragmentation; land cover change; remote sensing; Colombia; Andes,secondary forests;landscape fragmentation;land cover change;remote sensing;Colombia;Andes;LAND-COVER CHANGE;ALTERNATIVE SUCCESSIONAL PATHWAYS;TROPICAL FOREST;DEFORESTATION RATES;SPECIES RICHNESS;PATTERNS;AMAZON;AREA;GLOBALIZATION;CONSEQUENCES,Colombia,2-s2.0-85021122369

In the absence of governmental opposition, physicians are expected to lead tobacco control efforts. We studied Colombian medical students' smoking prevalence and tobacco attitudes. Methods. First- and fifth-year students from 11 medical schools in seven Colombian cities answered anonymous, self-administered, 38-item questionnaires. Additionally, smokers answered the Fagerstrom Test for Nicotine Dependence (FTND). Results. Two thousand twenty-one students (males 50.6%; age 15-44, median 19) completed the survey; average response rate was 89.9%. Globally 25.9% of students were current smokers (males 27.9%, females 24.0%). Living at higher altitude and attending private universities were associated with higher prevalence (P < 0.001). Males had a higher chance of having given up smoking (P < 0.05); 91.3% of current smokers would like to quit; 67.3% of all smokers and 44.8% of daily smokers scored 0 in the FTND. Prevalence was similar among first- and fifth-years, but fifth-year students were more complacent with smoking in health centers and showed a lesser desire to quit. Conclusions. Medical students' smoking prevalence is similar to that of the general population. Tobacco control strategies need to be included in the curriculum. Nicotine addiction does not seem to be the main perpetuating factor.

In an attempt to clarify the complex systematics and phylogeography of this taxon, we provide a first molecular analysis. We obtained mitochondrial cytochrome oxidase II (mtCOII) gene sequences from 49 tufted capuchins that had exact geographic origins from diverse lineages in Colombia, Peru, Bolivia, French Guyana, Brazil, Argentina and Paraguay and that belonged to clearly recognized morphological taxa. This project had 4 main findings: (1) we determined 2 established and related taxa in the northern Amazon River area, which we named C. a. apella and C. a. fatuellus. C. a. apella is distributed from French Guyana until, at least, the Negro River in the northern Brazilian Amazon, whereas C. a. fatuellus is distributed throughout the Colombian Eastern Llanos and the northern Colombian Amazon. We also determined 2 other southern C. apella taxa, which we named C. a. macrodon and C. a. cay. C. a. macrodon has a western and southern Amazon distribution, while C. a. cay has a more southern distribution outside the Amazon basin. (2) In the upper Amazon basin, there is a unique lineage (C. a. macrocephalus) with 1 widely distributed haplotype. The 4 morphological subspecies (C. a. maranonis, C. a. macrocephalus, C. a. peruanus, C. a. pallidus), and maybe a fifth unknown subspecies, described in this area were molecularly undifferentiated at least for the mitochondrial gene analyzed. (3) Our molecular analysis determined that 1 individual of C. robustus fell into the lineage of C. a. macrocephalus. Therefore, this form does not receive any specific name. (4) The animals classified a priori as C. nigritus and C. xanthosternos (because of their morphological phenotypes and by their geographical origins) were clearly differentiated from the other specimens analyzed with the molecular marker employed. Therefore, we consider that these 2 lineages could be assigned the status of full species following the biological species definition. (5) In 2001, Groves described 4 tufted capuchin species (C. apella, C. libidinosus, C. nigritus and C. xanthosternos), while Silva Jr. determined 7 species (C. apella, C. macrocephalus, C. libidinosus, C. cay, C. nigritus, C. robustus and C. xanthosternos). The tests of Swofford-Olsen-Waddell-Hillis, of Shimodaira and Hasegawa and of Templeton did not fit with either of these two classificatory schemes, although Groves' scheme was better with regard to our data than that of Silva Jr. (6) All the temporal splits among the tufted capuchin taxa studied were estimated to have occurred during the last phase of the Pleistocene by using the p statistic applied to the median joining haplotype network.

The number of leaves required for flowering was investigated in 'Keitt' and 'Tommy Atkins' mango trees exposed to tropical conditions in Colombia. Data were compared with a previous study conducted under cool, floral-inductive conditions in Florida (Davenport et al, 2006). Leaf-number treatments consisted of 0, 1/8, 1/4, 1/2, 1, 2, 3, or 4 leaves on each of 20-40 stems per branch. The long distance translocation experiment consisted of a terminal donor stem and five defoliated receiver stems on each treatment branch. Treatments were 0, 1, 3, or 5 leaves on the donor stem. Every treatment branch in both experiments was girdled to isolate it from the rest of the tree, and developing panicles were removed to stimulate lateral shoot initiation at a time when conditions were right for floral induction in those buds. Treatment stems hearing no leaves produced only vegetative shoots in both cultivars in both experiments. The minimum number of leaves per stem (1/8 of a leaf and 1/4 of a leaf) was sufficient to induce 6% and 1% reproductive shoots with 94% and 99% vegetative shoots in Tommy Atkins' and 'Keitt' stems, respectively. Branches bearing 4 leaves per stem in 'Tommy Atkins' trees produced the maximum mean flowering response with 45% reproductive Shoots and 55% vegetative shoots. The maximum 'Keitt' response was 22% reproductive and 78% vegetative shoots with 4 leaves per stem. The donor stein of the 1-leaf treatment and the donor and first receiver stem of the 3-leaf treatment in the translocation experiment were induced to flower in 'Tommy Atkins' trees. The more distal receiver stems from the donor were vegetative. The 5-leaf donor treatment-induced reproductive shoots as far as the third leafless receiver stem located 52 cm from the donor. Proportions of flowering shoots decreased with distance from the donor, and the level of the FP was apparently insufficient to reach the fourth and fifth receivers since their shoot responses were vegetative. Only vegetative shoot responses were obtained in the translocation experiment conducted in 'Keitt' trees. The leaf number and translocation experiment results support the hypothesis that far less FP is synthesized in both 'Tommy Atkins' and 'Keitt' leaves during warm, tropical conditions than is synthesized in 'Keitt' leaves exposed to cool, subtropical conditions.

Methods: Y-SNPs were typed in samples from six communities, including Palenque (renowned for its African linguistic and cultural heritage). Results: Findings reveal a high diversity of Y-haplogroups. With the exception of Palenque, the sum of European male lineages uniformly exceeded 57%. In Palenque, African lineages accounted for 57.7% of its chromosomes, with European male lineages constituting a mere 38.5%. In Pinillos, a significant proportion (23.8%) of the chromosomes belongs to the Native American haplogroup Q1a3a*-M3. Genetic differentiation analyses reveal significant divergences in most pairwise comparisons among the Bolivar municipalities, and the same holds between Bolivar and other South American populations.

Although many studies have contributed to what we know about the phylogenetics of Aotus, none used a sufficiently large number of samples to clarify its complexity. To address this need, we sequenced 696 base pairs of the mitochondrial cytochrome-oxidase II gene (mtCOII) in 69 specimens of 7 taxa of Aotus. We also analyzed 8 microsatellite loci in 136 individuals of 6 taxa. In contrast to previous studies, we sampled only wild individuals and have a precise geographical origin for each one. The mtDNA results showed that: 1) the northern gray-necked group of Aotus is genetically more homogeneous than the polyphyletic red-necked group of Aotus; 2) the ancestors of Aotus vociferans seem to be the original species candidate for the current Aotus; 3) Aotus azarae azarae and A. a. boliviensis are the most differentiated taxa, likely a result of extreme genetic drift during stasipatric speciation; 4) the first genetic splits found among taxa of Aotus occurred during the Pliocene (or even Miocene) while the most recent ones happened during the Pleistocene, when forest refugia may have played an important role in speciation. The mean number of microsatellite alleles was 3-5.33 alleles per locus. We found some private alleles that could be useful in helping to identify illegal trade, although a larger sample size is needed to ensure that these alleles are really private to the relevant taxa.

Design/methodology/approach - Using value chain analysis as primary research method, this paper identifies links and dynamics in the value chains that have been developed in the coffee industry in both countries to improve competitiveness, increase sustainability, and respond to market demands. Findings - Using value chain analysis, it was found that Colombia and Vietnam produce different types of coffee, and that both have implemented diverse strategies in order to be more competitive in domestic and foreign markets via product differentiation. These differences make explicit room for cooperation between these two countries in an international environment where fierce competition persists.

Ten of them were Amerindian communities coming from the northeastern part of Colombia, Pacific region, Eastern Plains and Amazonia. Six were black populations from Providence island, Caribbean and Pacific coasts. Finally, the Mestizo population of Bogota was studied as well. The APOE and ACE loci were in Hardy-Weinberg equilibrium, whereas the APOB locus was not studied in all populations. The genetic heterogeneity was substantially greater among the Amerindian populations (G(ST) = 0.059) than in the Afrocolombian populations (G(ST) = 0.009). Also the gene flow population pair estimates were so much higher among the Afrocolombian populations (Nm = 49.08 +/- 43.07) than among Amerindian populations (Nm = 9.66 +/- 18.04). Different phylogenetic and multivariant analyses showed that the Amerindian populations analyzed were clustered in three different arrays: one constituted by the Colombian northeastern and Pacific populations, the second one by the two Amazon populations (Coreguaje and Nukak) and the last one by the Yuco (the unique Caribbe-speaking population among those studied). The latter population was highly divergent from a genetic point of view from the remainder Amerindian populations studied. By using the Mantel test, the existence of a positive and significant correlation between the genetic and geographical distances found among Amerindian populations was demonstrated. This fact was not observed among the Afrocolombian populations. Nevertheless, an isolation-by-distance Slatkin analysis test did not show a significant clear structure of this special pattern among the Indian tribes studied. Copyright (C) 2001 S.

To evaluate the effectiveness of alcohol-based handrubs (ABH) in reducing acute diarrheal diseases (ADD) and acute respiratory infections (ARI) among children 1-5 years of age in childcare centers with limited tap water. Methods. This was the first cluster-randomized controlled trial in a developing country. The study took place at 42 childcare centers with sporadic and limited water availability in six towns in Colombia. Participants were randomly assigned to use ABH as a complement to handwashing (intervention arm: 21 centers/794 children); or to continue existing handwashing practices (control arm: 21 centers/933 children).

Through the study of the implementation of state-led adaptation and mitigation projects in two rural localities of northern Colombia, we interrogate the ways in which these interventions shape the everyday lives of those who happen to be located in the targeted areas. We found that, in spite of the different goals and particular configurations of the adaptation and mitigation interventions, these climate projects engendered the same contradiction. They promised a resilient and environmentally sound future, but the path towards that future has not been available to everyone. Furthermore, we show that the subjects of climate interventions do not embrace state promises in the same way. Local expectations, desires and engagement with the state are ambivalent and heterogeneous, and cannot be taken as a given. This paper develops these ideas by way of three arguments. First, we argue that exclusion, dispossession and marginality are inherent to the promises of climate mitigation and adaptation in the cases we study in the Colombian Caribbean. Secondly, the goals of state-led adaptation and mitigation programs we study are at odds with the material and social conditions of the areas of implementation. And thirdly, paying attention to the dynamics of state formation in the Colombian Caribbean in relation to climate change challenges common binaries opposing state absence/presence, failure/success, and retreat/return.

A convenience sample of 550 adults living in Bogota was presented with 12 realistic stories depicting a former perpetrator of violence (a member of the guerillas, the paramilitary, or the military) who begged a victim's family for forgiveness. The vignettes were created by combining the levels of 4 factors-Identity X Apologies (has apologized and offered compensation or not) X Type of Crime (murder or destruction of property) X Level of Responsibility (mere agent or organizer)-in a Latin square design. Three different rating scales were used: a willingness to forgive scale, an acceptance in the neighborhood scale, and an acceptance as a coworker scale. Through cluster analysis, 4 personal positions regarding forgiveness were found: a never forgive under any circumstances position (29%), a hesitant position (23%), an always forgive position (18%), and a depends on circumstances position (13%). Few participants adopted positions showing that at least minimal deliberation (weighing the pros and the cons) had taken place before responding. In addition, 17% of the sample was totally undetermined. Ninety-two percent of the participants who were hostile to forgiveness or hesitant were unwilling to have former perpetrators live in their neighborhoods, and 94% were unwilling to have them as coworkers. The corresponding figures were 62% and 66%, respectively, for participants holding an always forgive position. The gut reaction to former perpetrators found regarding the possibility of forgiving extended to the issue of reintegration. Overall, and despite the fact that, from a practical viewpoint, reintegrating people into society does not imply full forgiveness, Colombian people's views on reintegration are not more favorable than are their views on forgiveness. Public Significance Statement During the past few years, and possibly as a result of the development of the peace process, Colombian citizens have become more open to the idea of forgiveness to perpetrators of violence. This change has not yet manifested itself in a visible way, however. Rather, some people who were, in the recent past, hostile to the idea of forgiveness are now in a state of indetermination. To be successful, the reintegration of former perpetrators into society must be done with care, on a voluntary basis. Some citizens are blatantly hostile to the idea of living and working in the same places as former perpetrators; it would be difficult to impose perpetrators' presence on them in these places. A minority of citizens, however, is open to this idea: The process of reintegration is, therefore, not necessarily blocked everywhere.",Article,"Lopez, W.L.; Alvarado, G.S.; Rodriguez, S.; Ruiz, C.; Leon, J.D.; Pineda-Marin, C.; Mullet, E.",forgiveness; reintegration; Colombia; paramilitary forces; guerrilla,forgiveness;reintegration;Colombia;paramilitary forces;guerrilla;INTERGROUP FORGIVENESS;NORTHERN-IRELAND;RECONCILIATION SENTIMENT;COLLECTIVE GUILT;PTSD SYMPTOMS;MENTAL-HEALTH;CONFLICT;IMPACT;ASSOCIATION;GENOCIDE,Colombia;France,2-s2.0-85044862060

Several studies have reported segregated fruiting seasons of melastomes, but this pattern is not widespread. The segregated fruiting phenologies of congeneric sympatric species may be an evolutionary response to reduce competition for seed dispersers. Alternatively, aggregated fruiting phenologies may be favoured if local fruit abundance attracts more frugivores, thus enhancing seed dispersal. We monitored melastome fruiting in transects over a 2-y period at a cloud-forest site in the Colombian Andes. Fruiting periods of nine melastome species were aggregated and fruiting peaks coincided with rainy seasons. In a separate 6-mo study, observations at focal plants revealed that 47 of 61 bird species fed on 10 species of melastome, representing 37.4% of feeding events observed. Melastomes were consumed by birds in a higher proportion than expected from their availability and peak melastome fruit abundance coincided with the breeding season of the frugivore community, when melastomes constituted 54% of feeding records. Melastomes interact with a large number of bird species throughout their annual cycles, and seem to constitute pivotal elements that sustain the frugivore community in montane forests.",Article,"Kessler-Rios, M.M.; Kattan, G.H.",Andes; Colombia; frugivorous birds; frugivory; fruiting phenology; Miconia; Miconia theizans,Andes;Colombia;frugivorous birds;frugivory;fruiting phenology;Miconia;Miconia theizans;TEMPORAL VARIATION;TROPICAL FORESTS;RAIN-FOREST;COSTA-RICA;CROP SIZE;PLANTS;DISPERSAL;PATTERNS;TREES;SEED,Colombia,2-s2.0-83455250383

The main route of Chagas disease transmission is through vectors of the insect family Reduviidae. However, the parasite can also be transmitted from infected mothers to their fetus in utero. Until now, no cases of congenital Chagas disease have been reported in Colombia. Objective. A congenital Chagas disease case occurred in Moniquira County, Boyaca, Colombia. It was confirmed by comparing strains isolated from the mother and her baby using polymerase chain reaction (PCR) with arbitrary primers. Materials and methods. The parasite DNA was extracted from positive blood cultures of the aflicted mother and her son. The species confirmation and group detection were performed by PCR. The strain genotypes were determined by AP-PCR with two oligonucleotides based on the genes for the b-globin (5'-CCTCACCTTCTTTCATGGAG-3') and 16S RrNA (5'ACGGGCAGTGTGTACAAGACC-3'), in differente reactions. Results. The T. cruzi strains isolated from the blood cultures of the mother and her son showed the same amplification profile by the two AP-PCR tests; this corresponded with profiles of the T. cruzi I strains used as controls. However, T. cruzi II was also found in the blood culture from the newborn. Conclusions. This is the first case of Chagas disease transmission reported in Moniquira, demonstrating that this form of transmission occurs in Colombia. The presence of both groups of T. cruzi in the newborn sample suggests mixed infection in the mother as well, with a higher prevalence of T. cruzi I, at least in the mother's blood culture.",Article,"Pavia, P.X.; Montilla, M.; Florez, C.; Herrera, G.; Ospina, J.M.; Manrique, F.; Nicholls, R.S.; Puerta, C.",Chagas disease; Trypanosoma cruzi; maternal-fetal exchange; polymerase chain reaction; Colombia; AP-PCR,Chagas disease;Trypanosoma cruzi;maternal-fetal exchange;polymerase chain reaction;Colombia;AP-PCR;TRYPANOSOMA-CRUZI;AMPLIFICATION;TRANSMISSION,Colombia,

The condition, which affected three young adult men and six adolescent women, was attributed by them to a spell (maleficio). It was designated as ataques de locura (madness attacks) according to their traditional medical system; and as a conversive disorder with dissociative features by psychiatrists. Different therapeutic approaches, including antipsychotic medication, religious healers and traditional herbal remedies were unsuccessful. Contact with shamans of the same ethnic origin, on the other hand, proved to be an effective way of dealing with the symptoms. We interpret the situation as an expression of psychosocial stress secondary to cultural change. This medical problem bears close resemblance to other specific culture-bound syndromes such as ataques de nervios or possession syndromes and gives clues to ways of dealing with psychogenic expressions of cultural stress.",Article,"Pineros, Marion.; Rosselli, Diego.; Unknown",Colombia;Conversion disorder;Dissociative disorder;Hysteria;South American Indians,Colombia;Conversion disorder;Dissociative disorder;Hysteria;South American Indians,Colombia;Colombia,

Most research has focused on lowland forests, while bat assemblages in more threatened habitats, such as Andean forests, have been less studied. Thus, dietary records of, and comparisons among, poorly know montane species are still lacking. We investigated the structure and composition of a bat assemblage in a humid Andean forest in Colombia from November 2004 until May 2005 and recorded the diet of frugivorous species. The assemblage showed high species richness (20 species) and high diversity (H' = 3.24) if compared to other studies in similar mountain ecosystems. The diet of the genus Sturnira and Carollia brevicauda showed the tight association to species from Solanaceae and Piper, respectively, as it has been found at other sites in the Neotropics. Stenodermatines were associated to Cecropia telealba and a fig species. The former plus Piper aduncum were the most important food source for the frugivorous guild.

A critical analysis of the epidemiological data, March to July 2020","Background: Colombia detected its first coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19) case on March 2, 2020. From March 22 to April 25, it implemented a national lockdown that, apparently, allowed the country to keep a low incidence and mortality rate up to mid-May. Forced by the economic losses, the government then opened many commercial activities, which was followed by an increase in cases and deaths. This paper presents a critical analysis of the Colombian surveillance data in order to identify strengths and pitfalls of the control measures. Methods: A descriptive analysis of PCR-confirmed cases between March and July 25 was performed. Data were described according to the level of measurement. Incidence and mortality rates of COVID-19 were estimated by age, sex, and geographical area. Sampling rates for suspected cases were estimated by geographical area, and the potential for case underestimation was assessed using sampling differences. Results: By July 25, Colombia (population 50 372 424) had reported 240 745 cases and 8269 deaths (case fatality rate of 3.4%). A total of 1 370 271 samples had been analyzed (27 405 samples per million people), with a positivity rate of 17%. Sampling rates per million varied by region from 2664 to 158 681 per million, and consequently the incidence and mortality rates also varied. Due to geographical variations in surveillance capacity, Colombia may have overlooked up to 82% of the actual cases. Conclusion: Colombia has a lower case and mortality incidence compared to other South American countries. This may be an effect of the lockdown, but may also be attributed, to some extent, to geographical differences in surveillance capacity. Indigenous populations with little health infrastructure have been hit the hardest. (C) 2020 The Authors.

HCV is classified in six major genotypes and more than 70 subtypes. In Colombian blood banks, serum samples were tested for anti-HCV antibodies using a third-generation ELISA. The aim of this study was to characterize the viral sequences in plasma of 184 volunteer blood donors who attended the ""Banco Nacional de Sangre de la Cruz Roja Colombiana,'' Bogota, Colombia. Three different HCV genomic regions were amplified by nested PCR. The first of these was a segment of 180 bp of the 5'UTR region to confirm the previous diagnosis by ELISA. From those that were positive to the 5'UTR region, two further segments were amplified for genotyping and subtyping by phylogenetic analysis: a segment of 380 bp from the NS5B region; and a segment of 391 bp from the E1 region. The distribution of HCV subtypes was: 1b (82.8%), 1a (5.7%), 2a (5.7%), 2b (2.8%), and 3a (2.8%). By applying Bayesian Markov chain Monte Carlo simulation, it was estimated that HCV-1b was introduced into Bogota around 1950. Also, this subtype spread at an exponential rate between about 1970 to about 1990, after which transmission of HCV was reduced by anti-HCV testing of this population. Among Colombian blood donors, HCV genotype 1b is the most frequent genotype, especially in large urban conglomerates such as Bogota, as is the case in other South American countries. J. Med.

Employees from three Colombian samples completed the questionnaire (N = 831). Confirmatory factor analyses revealed a 21-factor structure (chi(2)/df ratio = 2.40, SRMR = .06, RMSEA = .04, CFI = .90) with adequate levels of convergent and discriminant validity. Additional support for construct validity was found from significant differences among different occupational groups (professional and nonprofessional, health-focused, commercial, and manufacturing workers). Furthermore, knowledge, social, and work context characteristics showed incremental validity over task characteristics on job satisfaction and perceived performance. Possible interpretations of these relationships are offered. It is concluded that the study provides evidence for the validity of a Spanish version of the scale, and presents further support for the generalization of the 21-factor structure of work design characteristics in different cultural settings.

In Colombia, reported cases of acute Chagas disease are sporadic. Objective. Ten cases were described that had been reported to the Parasitology Laboratory of the Colombian National Health Institute between December 2002 and November 2005. Materials and methods. Information from clinical records, epidemiological report forms, laboratory and blood tests was collated. In addition the following data were compiled: demographic variables, clinical findings, results of laboratory tests and other exams (such as peripheral blood smears), IFAT for IgG antibodies, isolation in culture medium, inoculation in mice, polymerase chain reaction tests and isoenzyme eletrophoresis. Results. All the cases presented in known endemic areas for Chagas disease transmission in Colombia. Three cases were from Putumayo Province, two each from the provinces of Arauca, Casanare, Norte de Santander and one from Santander Province. The probable mode of transmission was vector-borne. Seven cases presented in adults aged 18 to 50, three in children aged 6 months to 2 years. Seven were male and three were female. The most frequent symptom was fever in nine cases. Signs of portal of entry were rare; only one patient presented a possible Romaña's sign. Three patients presented myocarditis, two acute cardiac failure and one cardiac tamponade. Parasitemia was evident in nine cases; five had positive IgG serological tests; live cases were confirmed through parasite isolation; isoenzyme electrophoresis showed Trypanosoma cruzi group 1. Conclusions. Clinical variability prevailed. In none of the cases was a clinical diagnosis suspected. The diagnosis was made and confirmed through laboratory tests alone.

Seven AMS radiocarbon dates show these lake and swamp sediments represent the period from 8800 to 2610 C-14 yr BP. We identified seven distinct periods of environmental conditions in the basin. From ca. 8800 to 7700 C-14 yr BP (9450-8300 cal yr BP) Alnus and Myrica swamp forest grew on wet soils. On the surrounding slopes Andean forest was present with Hedyosmum, Melastomataceae and Quercus. Between 7700 and 6090 C-14 yr BP (8300-6750 cal yr BP) open water with aquatics alternated with peat-forming Plantago meadows reflecting repeated lake levels changes. From 6090 to 5220 C-14 yr BP (6750-5680 cal yr BP) open water and grassy vegetation around the lake was replaced by Alnus-dominated swamp forest, suggesting lower lake levels and drier climatic conditions. Between 5220 and 4500 C-14 yr BP (5680-4810 cal yr BP) an alternation between Alnus-dominated swamp forest and open grassy vegetation continued, reflecting fluctuating water levels. At that time Hedyostnum, Miconia, Quercus, Solanaceae, Retbunium and Rubiaceae were common elements in the Andean forest. From about 4500 to 3680 C-14 yr BP (4810-3800 cal yr BP) Alnus-dominated swamp forest alternated with Myrica shrub and much organic material accumulated in the basin. Evidence of deforestation (reduction of Quercus in particular), lowering of water tables and increasing disturbance, probably by erosion (presence of Amaranthaceae/Chenopodiaceae, Borreria and Dodonaea) point to the settlement of pre-Hispanic populations. Between 3680 and 2610 C-14 yr BP (3800-2470 cal yr BP) there is clear evidence of crop cultivation (presence of Zea mays) and frequent fires (high amounts of charcoal in the sediments). Erosion all over the basin led to significant sediment supply and the lake gradually changed into a swamp. By this time pre-Hispanic populations had used nearly all alder wood in the catchment area. The uppermost sediments are oxidised and the last 2610 radiocarbon years of the Holocene are not represented, possibly due to agricultural activities. (c) 2006 Elsevier B.V.

Solutions to these threats and needs are complex and will depend upon biological as well as cultural and political considerations. The objectives of this paper are to (1) quantify and characterize recent bear-human interactions in Colombia with respect to type and geographic distribution, and (2) identify conservation threats within the context of a general management program for Andean bears in Colombia. The study areais the entire range of the Andes Mountains in Colombia. The study is based on43 written responses to surveys distributed during the early part of 1997 to local government officials that summarized 257 bear-human interactions at 94 localities (138 observations, 66 attacks or depredation, 34 hunting kills of bears, and 19 live captures or sale of parts). Interactions were reported most frequently in the Eastern Cordillera (108). This was explained by recent increases in the level of human activities in that region. We recommend (1) that thesurvey be continued to estimate bear-human interaction trends, and (2) that Colombian officials focus their bear conservation and management activities on the Western and Eastern Cordilleras, in areas where human density is lowest and the amount of natural forest is greatest, but where deforestation as a result of human colonization is increasing.",Article,"Jorgenson, J.P.; SandovalA.; S.",Andean bear; bear-human interactions; Colombia; crop depredation; hunting; interviews; livestock depredation; management; Tremarctos ornatus,Andean bear;bear-human interactions;Colombia;crop depredation;hunting;interviews;livestock depredation;management;Tremarctos ornatus;CONSERVATION,Colombia,2-s2.0-33646020384

This region is the homeland of pre-Columbian Guane, whom spread over the ""Rio Suarez"" to the ""Rio de Oro"", and were surrounded to the west by the Central Andes, south and east by foothills of Eastern Andes, and north by the ""Chicamocha"" river canyon. Guanes established in a region that straddles the Andes and the northern Amazon basin, possibly making it an unavoidable conduit for people moving to and from South America. We amplified mtDNA hypervariable region I (HVI) segments from ancient bone remains, and the resulting sequences were compared with both ancient and modern mitochondrial haplogroups from American and non-American populations. Samples showed a distribution of 35% for haplogroup A, 41% for haplogroup B and 24% for haplogroup D. Nine haplotypes were found in 17 samples, indicating an unusually high genetic diversity on a single site ancient population. Among them, three haplotypes have not been previously found in America, two are shared in Asia, and one is a private haplotype. Despite geographical barriers that eventually isolated them, an important influence of gene flow from neighboring pre-Columbian communities, mainly Muiscas, could explain the high genetic polymorphism of this community before the Spanish conquest, and argues against Guanes as being a genetic isolate.

The complex dynamics of social-ecological systems (SES), the need for management capacities, and communities' limited empowerment and participation skills present challenges for community-based natural resource management (CBNRM) strategies. We analyzed the applicability of prospective structural analysis (PSA), a strategic foresight tool, to support decision making and to foster sustainable management and capacity building in CBNRM contexts and the modifications necessary to use the tool in such contexts. By testing PSA in three SES in Colombia, Mexico, and Argentina, we gathered information regarding the potential of this tool and its adaptation requirements. The results suggest that the tool can be adapted to these contexts and contribute to fostering sustainable management and capacity building. It helped identify the systems' dynamics, thus increasing the communities' knowledge about their SES and informing the decision-making process. Additionally, it drove a learning process that both fostered empowerment and built participation skills.

The country, as any other region in the world, is challenged by financial constraints and market pressures for entry of new and frequently costly technologies. After the 1993 health sector reform, Colombian citizens are entitled to health care access via mandatory health insurance through a benefits plan. Inclusions to this plan were the first attempt to establish a formal methodology of health technology assessment. Later on, the dynamics of insurers, market pressure, reimbursement decisions, and judicial actions drove the government toward the formulation of an infrastructure to improve efficiency in the use of resources.

The aim of this study was to determine previous exposure of wild and domestic animals to spotted fever group (SFG) rickettsiae through serological tests, to detect rickettsial evidence in their ectoparasites, and to analyze their possible role in the epidemiology of rickettsial diseases in this zone of the country. A cross-sectional association study was performed from 2010 to 2011. Blood and ectoparasite samples were collected from domestic animals and small mammals. A statistically significant association (p < 0.05) between seropositive animals and the study zones was observed. A total of 2937 ticks, 672 fleas and 74 lice were collected and tested in pools by PCR. The minimum infection rate (MIR) of the positive pools was 5% in ticks, 4% in fleas, and 0% in lice. Phylogenetic analyses showed circulation of three 4.Rickettsia species: R. felis in fleas, and R. bellii and Rickettsia sp. strain Atlantic rainforest, both in Amblyomma ovale ticks. In conclusion, this study demonstrated the occurrence of SFG rickettsiae in domestic, synanthropic and wild animals, and suggests the use of equines and canines as good sentinels of infection, in the study zone. We speculate that a transmission cycle exist involving rodents in the areas where these outbreaks have occurred.

Figs are potential keystone resources that sustain frugivore communities during periods of scarcity, but studies have produced contradictory results. Over 1 y we monitored the phenology of 206 trees of five Ficus species in a Colombian cloud forest, to test whether figs produced fruit during periods of low overall fruit availability. We also measured fig tree densities in 18 0.5-ha plots and made 190 h of observations at 24 trees of three species to determine whether figs were abundant and consumed by a large proportion of the local frugivores. The five species produced fruit year-round but fig availability varied monthly by orders of magnitude. Fig trees reached comparatively high densities of 1-5 trees ha(-1) and were consumed by 36 bird species (60% of the local frugivore assemblage) and three mammal species.

To study the inequalities in various mortality indicators for the departments of Colombia with respect to national figures, and to identify associations between the departmental mortality indicators and departmental socioeconomic indicators. Methods. To determine mortality rates and the Gini coefficient for mortality for the departments, data from the death registry were adjusted by the estimated registry coverage for each of the departments. Five socioeconomic indicators were selected: Gini coefficient for income distribution, Human Development Index, per capita gross domestic product, per capita social investment ( in health care, etc.), and percentage of the population with health care services from the country's social security system. The differences among the departments were then studied and compared to the national averages. The Spearman's rank correlation coefficient was calculated to find associations between the mortality indicators and each of the five socioeconomic indicators. Results. For Colombia overall, death registry coverage was estimated at 76%, with Choco department having the lowest coverage ( 35%), and Caldas department the highest ( 88%). The associations between the Gini coefficient for mortality and four of the socioeconomic indicators studied were significant. The national mortality rate was significantly associated with one socioeconomic indicator. Death caused by diabetes mellitus was associated with all the socioeconomic indicators; death caused by undernutrition or by diarrhea, with four socioeconomic indicators; and death from traffic accidents, with two socioeconomic indicators. Homicide was not associated with any of the socioeconomic indicators studied. Conclusions. Adjusting the death registry data produced mortality indicators that were more valid for drawing associations with socioeconomic indicators. The Gini coefficient of mortality, mortality from undernutrition, and mortality from diarrheal diseases were more suitable indicators for evaluating the inequalities among the departments because of their higher levels of association with the socioeconomic indicators. Regarding diabetes- related mortality, the associations with all the socioeconomic indicators could be due to systematic errors that lesser- developed departments made when the cause of death was being assigned. A department is a large unit for analysis, which can make it difficult to identify associations between socioeconomic indicators and deaths due to homicide or traffic accidents.",Article,"Garcia, J.R.",health status indicators; mortality; life tables; socioeconomic factors; population characteristics; Colombia,"health status indicators;mortality;life tables;socioeconomic factors;population characteristics;Colombia;INCOME INEQUALITY;HEALTH;FARR,WILLIAM;DEPRIVATION;PATTERNS",Colombia,2-s2.0-34249900983

Empirical observations have indicated that stems must be in rest for sufficient time, generally 4 to 5 months, to be induced to flower in the absence of cool temperatures. Twelve trees per cultivar were tip-pruned to stimulate a synchronous flush of vegetative growth at the beginning of the experiments. The first of four sets, each consisting of three replicate trees among the 12, were sprayed with 4% potassium nitrate on a 2-week schedule beginning 2 months after the pruning date. Biweekly sprays continued in this first set until a growth response was observed, whereupon the set was retired from further observations, and the second set of three synchronized trees began receiving biweekly spray treatments until they initiated a growth flush. The schedule continued through the four successive sets of trees until the age of stems necessary to induce a flowering response was determined. Treatment applications were quantified using a one-m-square quadrate to determine the numbers of resting stems and vegetative and /or reproductive shoots contained within. KNO3 sprays applied 3 months after the pruning date stimulated initiation of vegetatively induced shoots in both 'Keitt' and 'Tommy Atkins' trees. Synchronous generative shoot initiation in 'Keitt' trees occurred in approximate to 75% and 100% of the stems after KNO3 sprays applied 5 and 6 months after the pruning date, respectively. Tommy Atkins, a cultivar that is more difficult to induce to flower than 'Keitt', had 18% of shoots flowering after the 5-month application and 100% flowering after the KNO3 application 6 months after the pruning date. None of the non-treated orchard trees flowered during this time. Stem age was the key factor correlated with flowering. The experimental trees, which were naturally habituated to experience two flowering periods per year, each within separate sections of tree canopy, were stimulated to produce one annual synchronized flowering event throughout the tree canopy as a result of the treatments.",Article,"Ramirez, F.; Davenport, T.L.; Fischer, G.; Pinzon, J.C.A.",Colombia; off season flowering; Mangifera indica; tip-pruning,Colombia;off season flowering;Mangifera indica;tip-pruning;FLUCTUATIONS;CYTOKININS;INITIATION;GROWTH;CITRUS,Colombia;United States,2-s2.0-77958480472

The recent detection of this species in the Bogota plateau of Colombia raised the interest to investigate details about the biology of this new population and evaluate its potential as a biological control agent for use in that country against Frankliniella occidentalis Pergande (Thripidae), the western flower thrips. The objective of this study was to evaluate experimentally the biological characteristics of the Colombian population of G. aculeifer and its predation capacity on F. occidentalis, as well as the possibility to use a factitious prey for its mass production or as complementary food in predator field releases. The study was conducted with three diets: F. occidentalis (T), Aleuroglyphus ovatus (A), and A. ovatus + F. occidentalis (TA), in a randomized design experiment using G. aculeifer females. Predation rate was about 2.6 pre-pupae/pupae of F. occidentalis/female/day when only thrips was available as prey, reducing to 2.0 when thrips was combined with A. ovatus. Oviposition was the same when fed each of those prey and their combination (2.5-2.9 eggs/female/day). Some differences between diets were observed for duration of some periods of the life cycle, but no differences were observed for life table parameters. The greatest differences observed between this population and what has been reported for other populations of the same predator (evaluated when feeding other prey) refer to duration of deutonymphal period and R-o (respectively longer and higher in the former). It is concluded that the Colombian population is able to feed, develop, and reproduce on pre-pupae and pupae of F. occidentalis and that A. ovatus can be used for its small scale mass production and as a complementary diet in predator field releases.",Article,"Rueda-Ramirez, D.; Rios-Malaver, D.; Varela-Ramirez, A.; de Moraes, G.J.",Laelapidae; Colombia; biological control; life cycle; predation; mite diet,Laelapidae;Colombia;biological control;life cycle;predation;mite diet;HYPOASPIS-ACULEIFER;NATURAL ENEMIES;BIOLOGICAL-CONTROL;RHIZOGLYPHUS-ROBINI;LIFE-TABLE;CANESTRINI MESOSTIGMATA;APPARENT COMPETITION;ACARI ASTIGMATINA;BULB MITE;SOIL,Brazil;Colombia,2-s2.0-85058638139

Experiences from three countries in Latin America,"Community-based natural resource management (CBNRM) is a concept critical to managing social-ecological systems but whose implementation needs strengthening. Scenario planning is one approach that may offer benefits relevant to CBNRM but whose potential is not yet well understood. Therefore, we designed, trialed, and evaluated a scenario-planning method intended to support CBNRM in three cases, located in Colombia, Mexico, and Argentina. Implementing scenario planning was judged as worthwhile in all three cases, although aspects of it were challenging to facilitate. The benefits generated were relevant to strengthening CBNRM: encouraging the participation of local people and using their knowledge, enhanced consideration of and adaptation to future change, and supporting the development of systems thinking. Tracing exactly when and how these benefits arose was challenging, but two elements of the method seemed particularly useful. First, using a systematic approach to discuss how drivers of change may affect local social-ecological systems helped to foster systems thinking and identify connections between issues. Second, explicitly focusing on how to use and respond to scenarios helped identify specific practical activities, or ""response options,"" that would support CBNRM despite the pressures of future change. Discussions about response options also highlighted the need for support by other actors, e.g., policy groups: this raised the question of when and how other actors and other sources of knowledge should be involved in scenario planning, so as to encourage their buy-in to actions identified by the process. We suggest that other CBNRM initiatives may benefit from adapting and applying scenario planning.

Statistical analysis were carried out by chi-square test with 95% confidence intervals, multivariate regression models and Cronbach's alpha coefficient. Results The logistic regression analysis showed that vaccination use was related not only to population characteristics such as family size (OR=4.3), living area (OR=1.7), child's age (OR=0.7) and head-of-household's years of schooling (OR=0.5), but also strongly related to health care system features, such as having a regular health provider (OR=6.0) and information on providers' schedules and requirements for obtaining care services (OR=2.1).

Analysis of morphometric data strongly suggests that Inia are sexually dimorphic, with males smaller for several variables and more heterogeneous than females. Our morphological data supported that Colombian Amazon males had the greatest total body length as well as greatest fluke values (tip to tip) compared to the males from the Orinoco and Bolivia Rivers. There were also significant differences in females among populations. The two Colombian groups (Amazon and Orinoco basin) presented greater total body length than the Bolivian array, while distance from jaw tip to tip of dorsal fin was greater in the Orinoco basin females than in the other two populations. A Canonic Population Analysis showed that the confidence intervals of the Colombian Amazon and Orinoco males were partially superposed.

Two long standing debates exist in the systematic literature on Inia: (1) the number of extant species (one, Inia geoffrensis, or two I. geoffrensis and I. boliviensis) and (2) the number of extant subspecies of I. geoffrensis (I. geoffrensis geoffrensis, I. geoffrensis humboldtiana and I. geoffrensis boliviensis).

We applied an intermediate disturbance-complexity approach to the land-use changes of a Latin American biocultural landscape (Cauca river valley, Colombia, 1943–2010), which accounts for the joint behaviour of human appropriation of photosynthetic capacity used as a measure of disturbance, and a selection of land metrics that account for landscape ecological functionality. We also delved deeper into local land-use changes in order to identify the main socioeconomic drivers and ruling agencies at stake. The results show that traditional organic mixed-farming tended to disappear as a result of sugarcane intensification. The analysis confirms the intermediate disturbance-complexity hypothesis by showing a nonlinear relationship, where the highest level of landscape complexity (heterogeneity–connectivity) is attained when disturbance peaks at 50–60%. The study proves the usefulness of transferring the concept of intermediate disturbance to biocultural landscapes and suggests that conservation of heterogeneous and well-connected mixed-farming, with a positive interplay between intermediate level of disturbances and land-use complexity endowed with a rich intercultural heritage, will preserve a wildlife-friendly agro-ecological matrix likely to house high biodiversity and ecosystem services.",Article,"Marull, Joan.; Delgadillo, Olga Lucia.; Unknown.; Unknown.; Unknown",Biocultural heritage;Colombia;Disturbance ecology;Human appropriation of net primary production;Landscape agroecology;Latin America,Biocultural heritage;Colombia;Disturbance ecology;Human appropriation of net primary production;Landscape agroecology;Latin America,Colombia;Spain;Austria,

A qualitative, descriptive-interpretative study with content analysis was developed between 2008 and 2009. Sixty six women participated in five focus group discussions. To complement data, semi-structured interviews with seven key informants were conducted. Results. Main barriers are determined structurally by the current Colombian health system, based on insurance market. The right to access to treatment in a timely and continuous manner, the rights to confidentiality and non discrimination, and the right to quality care with gender focus are affected among participant women.

Evidence suggests that sugar sweetened beverages (SSB) are associated to overweight/obesity, and that taxes on these beverages could reduce their associated health consequences. This paper assesses the potential effect of different levels of a SSB tax in Colombia on overweight and obesity prevalence. Using peer-reviewed local data on own-price elasticity of SSB, we applied a comparative risk assessment strategy to simulate the effect of the SSB tax on a nationally representative nutritional survey with 7140 adults in 2010 (ENSIN, 2010). Our results varied depending on the tax scenario, pass-through assumption and household socio economic strata (SES). We found that among individuals belonging to lower SES households, the SSB tax would reduce overweight and obesity between 1.5-4.9 and 1.1-2.4 percentage points (p < 0.05), respectively. Among individuals belonging to higher SES households, we found no statistically significant effects on obesity, and a reduction on overweight prevalence between 2.9 and 3.9 percentage points (p < 0.05). In the most conservative scenario (40% pass-through), a tax rate of at least 75 cents of Colombian peso (0.75 COP) per milliliter (24% of the average price) is needed to have statistically significant effects on both overweight and obesity prevalence among lower SES households. The results of this study suggest that a SSB tax could reduce the overweight and obesity prevalence in Colombia, especially among lower SES households. This study shows that SSB taxes have a particularly beneficial effect in the most vulnerable population. Additional social and individual benefits, or individual costs arising from the tax are not assessed in this research, implying that even larger health gains could be observed.",Article,"Vecino-Ortiz, A.I.; Arroyo-Ariza, D.",Colombia; Taxes; Sugar sweetened beverages; Overweight; Obesity,Colombia;Taxes;Sugar sweetened beverages;Overweight;Obesity;PASS-THROUGH;PRICES;HEALTH;METAANALYSIS;CONSUMPTION;BEHAVIOR;WELFARE;POLICY;RISK;FOOD,Colombia;United States,2-s2.0-85047630567

The objective of this study was to determine whether there is an association between severe maternal mortality (SMM) and the characteristics of access to and use of obstetric services by the participating women. Methods. A study of cases and controls was conducted in a group of 600 women who were attended during pregnancy or the puerperium between 2011 and 2012 by obstetric services located in Medellin, Colombia. The study considered cases (n = 150) in obstetric patients who met the criteria for SMM established by the surveillance system being used in Medellin at the time of their admission. The controls (n = 450) were randomly selected in the same institutions where the patients were being treated. The information was obtained through an in-person interview, review of the patient's clinical history, and rating of the medical care provided by surveillance program personnel. The analysis was based on the model Road Map for Preventing Maternal Death developed jointly by Pan American Health Organization/World Health Organization, Centers for Disease Control, United Nations Population Fund for Latin America and the Caribbean, and Mothercare UK. Results. The proportion of unplanned pregnancies in the women studied was 57.6%, while the proportion of delay in the decision to seek care was 32.0%. Two variables were found to be associated with SMM: ethnicity (OR = 1.79) and delays due to deficiencies in the quality of care provided (OR = 8.54). Conclusions.

Methods: A validation study with experts and a pilot study were performed. It was conducted in the municipality of jamundi, located in the department of Valle del Cauca, Colombia. Probabilistic, multistage and stratified cluster sampling was carried out. The final sample was 215 households. Results: The survey was composed of 63 questions divided into five modules: socio-demographic profile of the head of the household or adult informant, household socioeconomic profile, access to preventive services, access to curative and rehabilitative services and household out of pocket expenditure. In descriptive terms, the promotion of preventive services only reached 44%; the use of these services was always highest among children younger than one year old and up to the age of ten. The perceived need for emergency medical care and hospitalisation was between 82% and 85%, but 36% perceived the quality of care to be low or very low. Delays were experienced in medical visits with GPs and specialists. Discussion: The designed survey is valid, relevant and representative of access to health services in Colombia. Empirically, the pilot showed institutional weaknesses in a municipality of the country, indicating that health coverage does not in practice mean real and effective access to health services.

The information collected from SISPRO is available for scientific analysis. Objectives We used data collected by SISPRO to estimate prevalence and specific characteristics of patients with SLE registered from January 2012 to December 2016. Methods This is a descriptive epidemiological study using the International Statistical Classification of Diseases and Related Health Problems as search terms related to SLE, based on SISPRO data. Criteria for diagnosis are not explicitly addressed in each individual case. Results National records report 41,804 patients with a diagnosis of SLE for an estimated prevalence of 91.9/100,000 subjects (based on a total population of 47,663,162), being more frequent in women (89% cases). When adjusted, female and male prevalences were 204.3 and 20.2 per 100,000 (ratio 10.1) with a 7.9:1 female:male ratio, and were highest in the 45-49-year age group.

However, research exploring the psychological drivers of deforestation, i.e., motivations, is still scant despite being crucial to understand the processes of land-use change and individual decision making within social-ecological systems. We studied the combined effect of structural and individual causes of deforestation, with particular emphasis on motivations, for a sample of rural households in Colombia's foremost tropical deforestation frontier. We implemented a new instrument based on self-determination theory to measure five different types of motivations to protect the forests: intrinsic, guilt/regret, social, extrinsic motivations, and amotivation (lack of motivation). Our findings show that, controlling for the structural and household drivers widely identified in the deforestation literature, intrinsic motivations positively correlate with less self-reported deforestation. Also, amotivated people and those with extrinsic motives, such as expected payments for conservation, are more likely to deforest. Our results show that motivations can explain variation in land-use decisions and thus should be considered when designing, implementing, and evaluating conservation policies aiming to halt deforestation.",Article,"Rueda, X.; Velez, M.A.; Moros, L.; Rodriguez, L.A.",agricultural expansion; Colombia; deforestation frontier; land-use change; motivations,agricultural expansion;Colombia;deforestation frontier;land-use change;motivations;CONSERVATION;PERCEPTIONS;INCENTIVES;ATTITUDES;PAYMENTS;SERVICES;BEHAVIOR;DRIVERS;POLICY,Colombia;Spain,2-s2.0-85065785575

A systematic assessment of the costs can quantify the funding required and identify processes to improve efficiency of cancer registries. Methods: The Centers for Disease Control and Prevention's (CDC's) International Registry Costing Tool (IntRegCosting Tool) was tailored specifically for the Colombian registries and was used to collect resource use data from five regional population-based cancer registries: Barranquilla, Bucaramanga, Cali, Manizales, and Pasto. The registries provided cost data for the year 2013 and cancer cases corresponding to the year 2010. Results: We identified an almost threefold variation in the average cost per case (77,932 to 214,082 Colombian pesos or US $41 to US $113 in 2013) across the registries, but there were also substantial differences in data collection approaches, types of data collected, and activities performed. Cost per inhabitant varied between 95 and 415 Colombian pesos (US $0.05 to US $0.22). Between 20% and 45% of the total cost was due to fixed cost activities. Conclusions: The detailed economic information presented in this study constitutes a valuable source of activity-based cost data that registries can use to compare operations, assess key factors that lead to differences in cost per case, and identify potential approaches to improve efficiencies.

Objective: To identify the presence of mutations in the Colombian population and evaluate two testing strategies. Methods: From a total universe of 853 individual blood samples referred for BRCA1 and BRCA2 typing, 256 cases were analyzed by complete direct sequencing of both genes in Myriad Genetics, and the remaining 597 cases were studied by partial sequencing based on founder mutations in a PCR test designed by ourselves (“Profile Colombia”). Results: We found 107 patients carrying deleterious mutations in this group of patients, 69 (64.5%) located in BRCA1, and 38 (35.5%) in BRCA2. Overall, we detected 39 previously unreported mutations in Colombia (22 in BRCA1 and 17 in BRCA2) and only 4 out of the 6 previously reported founder mutations. Sixty four out of 597 patients (10.7%) studied by “Profile Colombia” showed mutations in BRCA1 or BRCA2, and 41/256 patients (16%) showed mutations by complete BRCA1-BRCA2 sequencing. Conclusions: The spectrum of 44 different mutations in Colombia as detected in our study is broader than the one previously reported for this country. “Profile Colombia” is a useful screening test to establish both founder and new mutations (detection rate of 10.7%) in cases with family history of breast cancer.

Fig wasps can only develop within fig inflorescences (syconia) and they are the only organisms capable of pollinating fig flowers. Other non-pollinating wasps that lay eggs by inserting their ovipositors from the outside can also develop in syconia. These parasitic wasps may be parasitoids of either pollinating or other non-pollinating wasps, or form galls in fig flowers or other tissues. Depending on this interaction, parasitic wasps may have various effects on the production of pollinating wasps and seeds. Wasps in the genus Idarnes, which parasitize New World figs (subgenus Urostigma), have an effect on wasp production but not on seed production. Heterandrium spp., which have short ovipositors and lay on external flowers, are infrequent and no effect on seed production has been documented. In the Colombian Andes, Idarnes spp. and Heterandrium spp. are the most frequent parasites of the Ficus andicola Pegoscapus sp. mutualism, affecting 62 and 43 percent of syconia, respectively. Controlling for other factors that influence wasp and seed production, such as number of foundresses, syconium size and tree, we found that Idarnes reduced pollinator production by almost half but did not reduce seed production, whereas Heterandrium reduced seed production by 40 percent, and marginally affected pollinator production. Our results provide the first clear documentation of Heterandrium spp. impact on fig seed production. Whether the relative abundance of this genus is a generalized phenomenon in montane forest remains to be determined. Resumen Los arboles del genero Ficus y las avispas de la subfamilia Agaoninae participan en un mutualismo obligado. Estas avispas solo pueden desarrollarse dentro de las inflorescencias (siconos) de estos arboles y son practicamente los unicos organismos que pueden fecundar sus flores. Otras avispas no polinizadoras ponen huevos en los siconos, insertando sus ovipositores a traves de la pared externa. Estas avispas parasitas pueden ser parasitoides de las polinizadoras o de otras avispas no polinizadoras, o formar agallas en las flores u otros tejidos. Dependiendo de esta interaccion, las avispas parasitas pueden tener efectos sobre la produccion de avispas polinizadoras y de semillas. Las avispas del genero Idarnes son parasitos en Ficus del Nuevo Mundo del subgenero Urostigma. Algunos estudios han demostrado que estas afectan la produccion de avispas polinizadoras, pero no afectan la produccion de semillas. Las avispas del genero Heterandrium, las cuales tienen ovipositores cortos y ponen sus huevos en las flores mas cercanas a la pared del sicono, son poco comunes y no se ha documentado un efecto claro sobre la produccion de semillas. En el mutualismo entre Ficus andicola y Pegoscapus sp. en los Andes de Colombia, Idarnes spp. y Heterandrium spp. son las avispas parasitas mas comunes y parasitan respectivamente 62% y 43% de los siconos. Teniendo en cuenta otros factores que influyen la produccion de avispas polinizadoras y semillas, como son el numero de avispas fundadoras, el tamano del sicono y el arbol, encontramos que Idarnes redujo la produccion de polinizadores casi a la mitad, pero no tuvo efecto sobre la produccion de semillas. Por su parte Heterandrium redujo la produccion de semillas en 40% y tuvo un efecto marginal sobre los polinizadores.

In short, it proposes the formulation of policies that allow the State to exert a facilitating role that aims to ""midwife"" the formation and development of self-reliant grassroots organizations. This ""facilitatory"" role would represent a third-way between two previous approaches that have failed in Colombia in the past: the ""top-down"" interventions on farmer enterprises devised by the State in the 1960s and 1970s and the ""hands-off"" approach that was indifferent toward the development of smallholder organizations in the 1990s and 2000s.",Article,Unknown,Agricultural cooperatives;Agriculture;Colombia;Peasant economy;Public policies;Rural development,Agricultural cooperatives;Agriculture;Colombia;Peasant economy;Public policies;Rural development,United Kingdom;Colombia;Italy;United Kingdom;Netherlands,

However, different socioeconomic drivers of change are affecting indigenous chagra TEK, resulting in changes in practices and land-use patterns. This study examines TEK transformations from 1970 to 2016 and their relation to rainforest management in the Ticuna indigenous resguardo of El Vergel (Leticia Municipality, Amazonas Department). It employs an ethnographic case study design that articulates quantitative data on land-use variables related to chagras and qualitative ethnographic data describing dimensions of TEK and its perceived transformations, including knowledge of the environment, practices and management systems, social institutions, and worldviews. Our findings reveal that TEK transformations entail changes in land-use, including size of production area, temporality of land-use, and cultivated diversity. This study contributes to a reinterpretation of TEK transformations and emphasizes the importance of the chagra as an adaptive system. The TEK transformations related to chagras imply a constant reattunement of relations that bind people and their environments. Rather than being frozen in an ethnographic past, people have responded to social and economic drivers to meet their current needs and aspirations. Likewise, understanding TEK transformations and their relation to changes in land-use practices provides relevant insights about social-ecological dynamics in the Amazon rainforest to navigate change and provide the basis for a discussion of how to enrich management decisions to move toward sustainability in tropical forests.",Article,"Fonseca-Cepeda, V.; Idrobo, C.J.; Restrepo, S.",Amazon rainforest; chagra; Colombia; indigenous people; land use; traditional ecological knowledge,Amazon rainforest;chagra;Colombia;indigenous people;land use;traditional ecological knowledge;LAND-COVER CHANGE;SLASH-AND-BURN;SHIFTING CULTIVATION;SWIDDEN CULTIVATION;TROPICAL FORESTS;SUSTAINABILITY;AGRICULTURE;MANAGEMENT;DYNAMICS;DRIVERS,Colombia,2-s2.0-85065799999

Its geographic distribution is restricted to a small area of the Colombian Llanos, where there are major human impacts, involving the loss, fragmentation and degradation of its forests due particularly to agricultural conversion, and this species' persecution for the pet trade. Here we review its status, and argue that it is threatened and that it be considered as Vulnerable (VU) on future iterations of the IUCN Red List. We suggest the possibility, based on comparative studies of 1140 base pairs of the cytochrome b mitochondrial gene of 38 Saimiri specimens of nine different taxa, that the Colombian taxa could be considered subspecies of Saimiri cassiquiarensis (not S. sciureus as is currently believed), all showing similar haplotypes that are different from Saimiri sciureus sciureus of the eastern Amazon.

Disability adjusted life years (DALYs) have been developed to compare the burden of this disease both between conditions and between geographical boundaries. With improving data on disease incidence and prevalence in Colombia, we can refine our DALYs-based estimates. Methods: Using different strategies, including the official healthcare provision database and death certificates, as well as extrapolation from published neuroepidemiologic studies, we estimated the incidence and prevalence by age groups, disease duration and attributable mortality. With this information we calculated DALYs for the year 2012. Results: Overall, it was found that epilepsy was responsible for 0.88% of all deaths in Colombia. A total of 5.25 DALYs per 1,000 person-years are lost due to epilepsy in Colombia, 75% of which (3.91 DALYs) are due to premature mortality, with a higher burden in men (6.12 DALYs) than in women (4.41 DALYs). Conclusions: We reported new estimations on epilepsy incidence and prevalence by age groups in Colombia and conclude that DALYs lost due to epilepsy in Colombia are almost double the previous figure, mostly because of the underestimation of attributable mortality. With this figure, epilepsy ranks 12th instead of 19th in the list of the most important causes of DALYs lost. (C) 2015 S.

Methods: A household survey was carried out in a random sample of insured poor population in Bogota, in 1999. The conceptual and analytical framework was based on the Andersen's Behavioral Model of Health Services Utilization. It considers two units of analysis for studying vaccination use and its determinants: the insured poor population, including the children and their families characteristics; and the health care system. Statistical analysis were carried out by chi-square test with 95% confidence intervals, multivariate regression models and Cronbach's alpha coefficient. Results: The logistic regression analysis showed that vaccination use was related not only to population characteristics such as family size (OR=4.3), living area (OR=1.7), child's age (OR=0.7) and head-of-household's years of schooling (OR=0.5), but also strongly related to health care system features, such as having a regular health provider (OR=6.0) and information on providers' schedules and requirements for obtaining care services (OR=2.1). Conclusions: The low vaccination use and the relevant relationships to health care delivery systems characteristics show that there are barriers in the healthcare system, which should be assessed and eliminated.

In order to develop effective conservation plans for this group, more detailed knowledge of the different aspects of their biology and interaction with human communities is required. We evaluated the nestling diet of the Black-and-chestnut Eagle for three breeding periods using three different methods in the rural area of Gachala-Cundinamarca, on the eastern slope of the Eastern Cordillera of Colombia. In addition, we surveyed people living in the study area to assess the existence of potential eagle-human conflicts. Of the eight taxa recorded as prey, the Andean Guan (Penelope montagnii) was the most frequent (40%), while the House Chicken (Gallus gallus) contributed the greatest biomass (47%). Our surveys reveal an estimated yearly loss of one to two domestic fowl individuals per household, with 57% of owners surveyed claimed to have suffered losses. According to the survey results, inhabitants would prefer not to have the eagle breeding close to their houses (< 10 km), and would consider killing eagles if they preyed upon more than five domestic fowl individuals a year. To reduce the threat and the current human-eagle conflict in the area, it is important to consider ""win-win"" strategies, some of which are already being studied in the area, such as birdwatching initiatives.",Article,"Zuluaga, S.; Echeverry-Galvis, M.A.",Andes; Black-and-Chestnut Eagle; Colombia; Diet; Domestic Fowl; Human Conflict; Persecution; Spizaetus isidori,Andes;Black-and-Chestnut Eagle;Colombia;Diet;Domestic Fowl;Human Conflict;Persecution;Spizaetus isidori;BONELLIS EAGLES;CONSERVATION;WORLDWIDE;PATTERNS;PREDATOR;FOREST;PREY,Colombia,2-s2.0-84992202276

During the third pandemic that started in Hong Kong (1894), the disease spread through maritime routes to different regions in the world, including South America. In this region, approximately 16 million people are thought to be at risk in relation to this disease due to specific situations like human-rodent coexistence inside houses in rural areas, homes built with inadequate materials that are vulnerable to invasion by these animals, inappropriate storage of crops and an increase in rainfall and deforestation, which allows for the displacement of wild fauna and man invasion of the natural foci of the disease. Between 1994 and 1999, five countries: Bolivia, Brazil, Ecuador, Peru and the United States of America, reported approximately 1,700 cases with 79 related deaths.

This episode was, followed by two more, one in the municipality of Los Cordobas in 2007 with a 54% of lethality and the other one in the municipality of Turbo in 2008 with 27% of lethality. The aim of this study was to perform serological tests in healthy persons to determine the seroprevalence of antibodies against spotted fever group (SFG) rickettsiae and develop a survey to study some infection risk-related factors. A cross-sectional study was performed in 2011 and 2012. A blood sample and survey of associated factors was performed in healthy persons. A prevalence of 32%-41% was found in healthy people. From the multivariate analysis, we found that people living more than 16 years in these sites had a 79% higher risk of being seropositive and a 46% higher risk when they reported having birds in their houses if the variable of having a horse was included in the model.

,,,12,WOS:000465061200028,2019,Illicit activity and money laundering from an economic growth perspective: A model and an application to Colombia,"This paper contributes to the economic analysis of illicit activities and money laundering. First, it presents a theoretical model of long-run growth that explicitly considers illicit workers, activities, and income, alongside a licit private sector and a functioning government. Second, it generates estimates of the size of illicit income and provides simulated and econometric estimates of the volume of laundered assets in the Colombian economy. In the model, the licit sector operates in a perfectly competitive environment and produces a good through a standard neoclassical production function. The illicit sector operates in an imperfectly competitive environment and is composed of two different activities: The first activity produces an illicit good that nonetheless is valuable in the market (for example illegal drugs); the second does not add value to the economy but only redistributes wealth (for example robbery, kidnapping, and fraud). The paper provides a series of comparative statics exercises to assess the effects of changes in government efficiency, licit sector productivity, and the demand for illegal drugs. From the model, the analysis derives a set of estimable macroeconometric equations to measure the size of laundered assets in the Colombian economy in the period 1985-2013. The paper assembles a dataset whose key components are estimates of illicit income from drug trafficking and common crime. Illicit incomes increased drastically until 2001, reaching a peak of nearly 12% of gross domestic product and then decreasing to less than 2% by 2013. The decline not only overlaps with a period of high economic growth but also occurs after the implementation of Plan Colombia. The dataset is used to estimate the volume of laundered assets in the economy by applying the Kalman filter for the estimation of unobserved dynamic variables onto the derived macroeconometric equations from the model. The findings show that the volume of laundered assets increased from about 8% of gross domestic product in the mid-1980s to a peak of 14% by 2002, and declined to 8% in 2013.

Objective: To identify the presence of mutations in the Colombian population and evaluate two testing strategies. Methods: From a total universe of 853 individual blood samples referred for BRCA1 and BRCA2 typing, 256 cases were analyzed by complete direct sequencing of both genes in Myriad Genetics, and the remaining 597 cases were studied by partial sequencing based on founder mutations in a PCR test designed by ourselves (""Profile Colombia""). Results: We found 107 patients carrying deleterious mutations in this group of patients, 69 (64.5%) located in BRCA1, and 38 (35.5%) in BRCA2. Overall, we detected 39 previously unreported mutations in Colombia (22 in BRCA1 and 17 in BRCA2) and only 4 out of the 6 previously reported founder mutations. Sixty four out of 597 patients (10.7%) studied by ""Profile Colombia"" showed mutations in BRCA1 or BRCA2, and 41/256 patients (16%) showed mutations by complete BRCA1-BRCA2 sequencing. Conclusions: The spectrum of 44 different mutations in Colombia as detected in our study is broader than the one previously reported for this country.

Tests for regionally endemic agents including Plasmodium, Leptospira, Salmonella, dengue virus, Brucella, Rickettsia, human immunodeficiency virus and hepatitis viruses were negative. Because the patient was enrolled in a clinical trial for hemorrhagic fevers conducted by the University of Cordoba, serum samples were collected on admission and at discharge. Testing using Sin Nombre virus ELISA showed IgG and IgM seroconversion between samples. The eventual finding of this first clinical case of hantavirus infection in Colombia is consistent with the high prevalence of hantavirus antibodies in humans in the region and the likely exposure of the patient to rodents.

In Colombia, a national plan to tackle the epidemic was formulated with little evidence that its implementation in the local context is effective. This study focused on Cartagena - one of Colombia's largest cities and an international touristic hub - that presents one of the highest HIV prevalences in the country, to investigate whether the national plan accounts for local specificities and what are the barriers to local implementation. Based on the Contextual Interaction Theory (CIT), this qualitative research relied upon 27 interviews and 13 life stories of local inhabitants and stakeholders, collected in a first fieldwork in 2006-2007. A follow-up data collection took place in 2013 with 10 participants: key policymakers and implementers, NGO representatives and local inhabitants. Barriers identified by the participants included: local population's understandings and beliefs on condom use; stigma and discrimination; lack of collaboration from the Church, the education sector and local politicians; corruption; high staff turnover; frequent changes in leadership; lack of economic and human resources: and barriers to health care access. The findings suggest that global influences also have an impact on the CIT framework (e.g. international organisations as a major financier in HIV prevention). The participants put forward several feasible solutions to implementation barriers. We discuss how several of the proposed solutions have been applied in other Latin American and Caribbean countries and yielded positive results. However, further research is needed to find possible ways of overcoming certain barriers identified by this study such as corruption, the lack of collaboration of the Church and barriers to health care access.

The study considered cases (n = 150) in obstetric patients who met the criteria for SMM established by the surveillance system being used in Medellín at the time of their admission. The controls (n = 450) were randomly selected in the same institutions where the patients were being treated. The information was obtained through an in-person interview, review of the patient's clinical history, and rating of the medical care provided by surveillance program personnel.

The aim of this study was to describe the reproduction and molting cycle of Blue-black Grassquit and Gray Seedeater, in a secondary scrub of tropical dry forest, upper Magdalena valley, Tolima-Colombia. The molt and plumage terminology by Humphey & Parkes (1959) and Howell et al. (2003) were used, while age classification system followed Wolfe et al. (2010). We use temporal dynamics of relative abundance of captured birds and age structure to analyze the annual cycle for both species. Breeding season was extended for both species ranging from six to seven months, with no evidence of individual birds overlapping breeding and molt, although breeding and molting seasons overlap at the population level. Differences in individual and population life-cycle regulation could be due to a marked seasonality in food supply, promoted by the bimodal rainfall that characterizes this ecosystem. Such population overlap of molt and reproduction could be due to individual variation within species. We found evidence of suspended prebasic and preformative molts in both species, thus promoting an overlap with prealternate molt when they restart. These are the first descriptions of the breeding and molting cycles for Blue-black Grassquit and Gray Seedeater in northern South America. Resumen. – Los ciclos de reproducción y muda de la mayoría de aves neotropicales son aún desco-nocidos. Los vacíos de conocimiento incluyen la dinámica temporal de la estructura etaria, la cual permite una mejor evaluación de las presiones ecológicas que enfrentan las especies. El objetivo de este estudio fue describir el ciclo anual de reproducción y muda en el Volatinero Negro y el Semillero Gris, en un matorral secundario del bosque seco tropical del alto valle del río Magdalena, Tolima, Colombia. Seguimos la terminología de mudas y plumajes de Humphey & Parkes (1959) y Howell et al. (2003) y el sistema de edades propuesto por Wolfe et al. (2010). Utilizamos la dinámica temporal de la abundancia relativa y la estructura etaria, para analizar el ciclo de vida de las dos especies. Encontramos que los periodos reproductivos en ambas especies se extienden entre seis y siete meses, por lo cual promueven la asincronía poblacional; sin embargo, no encontramos evidencia de adultos reproductivos en muda activa. Aunque las temporadas de muda y reproducción se encuentran solapadas a nivel de la población, los procesos son mutuamente excluyentes a nivel de los individuos. Esto podría deberse a la marcada estacionalidad en la oferta de alimento, promovida por el régimen bimodal de lluvias que caracterizan este ecosistema. Mientras que el solapamiento poblacional de la muda y la reproducción podría ser consecuencia de la variación individual dentro de las especies.

Objective: To determine the resistance of H. pylori to clarithromycin in a population from Cauca province, through the identification of mutations in the 23S rRNA gene in DNA from gastric biopsies. Materials and methods: A total of 162 patients with functional dyspepsia were included in the study. The 23S rRNA gene and the DNA from 162 gastric specimens were amplified by PCR, and the mutation pattern was identified by direct sequencing. Results: The frequency of clarithromycin resistance was 4%. A2143G mutation was found in four patients (2.46%) and A2142G mutation was found in three patients (1.85%). Conclusions: Our study shows that the most frequent genotype in H. pylori-positive specimens was A2143G, followed by A2142G. The observed resistance prevalence of H. pylori was low; thus, we consider that clarithromycin treatment is a valid option for H. pylori eradication in the study population.",Article,"Acosta, C.P.; Hurtado, F.A.; Trespalacios, A.A.",Clarithromycin; sequencing; 23S rRNA gene; mutation; Helicobacter pylori; Colombia,Clarithromycin;sequencing;23S rRNA gene;mutation;Helicobacter pylori;Colombia;23S RIBOSOMAL-RNA;ANTIBIOTIC-RESISTANCE;ANTIMICROBIAL SUSCEPTIBILITY;CONSENSUS REPORT;POINT MUTATIONS;INFECTION;CLASSIFICATION;MANAGEMENT;GASTRITIS,Colombia,2-s2.0-84907315147

Halperin et al. (2013) found that reappraisal-an adaptive form of emotion regulation - decreased negative emotions triggered by anger-inducing information related to the Israeli-Palestinian conflict, and increased support for conciliatory statements. We tested these effects in the context of the conflict between the Colombian government and the Fuerzas Armadas Revolucionarias de Colombia-Ejercito del Pueblo (FARC-EP). Reappraisal training reduced negative emotions produced by a presentation that illustrated FARC's violent actions, and increased support for conciliatory statements (with overall moderate effect magnitudes). We also found that negative emotions mediated the effects of reappraisal on the support for aggressive and conciliatory statements.

Methodology: A random sample of women living in poor neighborhoods from four Colombian cities (Cali, Cartagena, Medellín and Ibague) was made (survey method), using a cross-sectional design; survival analysis techniques were applied. Results Bivariate analysis identified hospital bottle use, the women's marital status, and relationship with the head of household as having had a significant effect on the duration of exclusive breastfeeding. Multivariate analysis identified the non-use of bottles in hospital as favoring a longer breast feeding period. Conclusions: Reducing hospital bottle use is readily achievable by health system action; increasing the time mothers spend with their infants is more difficult. A relevant finding was that more mothers were unaware of breastfeeding's maternal benefits than those who were unaware of its benefits for the baby. If mothers were made more aware of the maternal benefits, an increasing number might insist on being the main caregiver and take care of their children for longer periods of time.",Article,"Rodriguez-Garcia, Jesus.; Ramirez, Naydu Acosta",Breastfeeding;Colombia;Exclusive breast feeding;Survival analysis,Breastfeeding;Colombia;Exclusive breast feeding;Survival analysis,Colombia,

However, despite the spread of such technologies in high-income countries, these technologies have not yet been commonly adopted in low- and middle-income countries. People living in these parts of the world are at risk of experiencing physical, technological, and social health inequalities. A possible solution is to utilize the currently available HITs developed in other counties. Objective: Using participatory design methodologies with Colombian end users (young people, their supportive others, and health professionals), this study aimed to conduct co-design workshops to culturally adapt a Web-based Mental Health eClinic (MHeC) for young people, perform one-on-one user-testing sessions to evaluate an alpha prototype of a Spanish version of the MHeC and adapt it to the Colombian context, and inform the development of a skeletal framework and alpha prototype for a Colombian version of the MHeC (MHeC-C). Methods: This study involved the utilization of a research and development (R&D) cycle including 4 iterative phases: co-design workshops; knowledge translation; tailoring to language, culture, and place (or context); and one-on-one user-testing sessions. Results: A total of 2 co-design workshops were held with 18 users-young people (n=7) and health professionals (n=11). Moreover, 10 users participated in one-on-one user-testing sessions-young people (n=5), supportive others (n=2), and health professionals (n=3). A total of 204 source documents were collected and 605 annotations were coded. A thematic analysis resulted in 6 themes (ie, opinions about the MHeC-C, Colombian context, functionality, content, user interface, and technology platforms). Participants liked the idea of having an MHeC designed and adapted for Colombian young people, and its 5 key elements were acceptable in this context (home page and triage system, self-report assessment, dashboard of results, booking and video-visit system, and personalized well-being plan). However, to be relevant in Colombia, participants stressed the need to develop additional functionality (eg, phone network backup; chat; geolocation; and integration with electronic medical records, apps, or electronic tools) as well as an adaptation of the self-report assessment. Importantly, the latter not only included language but also culture and context. Conclusions: The application of an R&D cycle that also included processes for adaptation to Colombia (language, culture, and context) resulted in the development of an evidence-based, language-appropriate, culturally sensitive, and context-adapted HIT that is relevant, applicable, engaging, and usable in both the short and long term. The resultant R&D cycle allowed for the adaptation of an already available HIT (ie, MHeC) to the MHeC-C-a low-cost and scalable technology solution for low- and middle-income countries like Colombia, which has the potential to provide young people with accessible, available, affordable, and integrated mental health care at the right time.",Article,"Ospina-Pinillos, L.; Davenport, T.A.; Navarro-Mancilla, A.A.; Cheng, V.W.S.; Alarcon, A.C.C.; Rangel, A.M.; Rueda-Jaimes, G.E.; Gomez-Restrepo, C.; Hickie, I.B.",Colombia; telemedicine; medical informatics; eHealth; mental health; cultural characteristics; cultural competency; ethnic groups; quality of health care; community-based participatory research; primary health care; patient participation; patient preference; patient satisfaction; consumer health information; methods; research design,Colombia;telemedicine;medical informatics;eHealth;mental health;cultural characteristics;cultural competency;ethnic groups;quality of health care;community-based participatory research;primary health care;patient participation;patient preference;patient satisfaction;consumer health information;methods;research design;DSM-IV;DISORDERS;CARE;ADAPTATION;BEHAVIORS;VALIDITY,Australia;Colombia,2-s2.0-85097854469

Ancient bone remains constitute an important source of biological information, and their genetic characterization allows the confirmation or rebuttal of human affiliations proposed on the basis of non-molecular approaches. Pre-Columbian history of the Eastern Andes in Colombia has been divided into three main periods: (i) an early colonization by groups of hunter-gatherers, (ii) an intermediate period ""Herrera"" characterized by primitive agriculture and (iii) a late stage of Chibcha-speaking groups, with agriculture and ceramics (""agroalfarero""). Objective. The mitochondrial DNA on ancient bone remains of the Herrera period were analyzed for comparison with modern and other ancient DNAs. Materials and methods. Mitochondrial DNA was extracted from 11 Herrera individuals [similar to 2,000 years before present (YBP)] found in the Madrid 2-41 archaeological site near Bogota, Colombia. A 192 bp segment of the hypervariable segment I was amplified and sequenced, following stringent archaic DNA authenticity criteria. The sequences were compared with those in American and European databases using bioinformatics tools. Results. All individuals had identical sequences and were classified as haplogroup B. This identity may be related to the type of ritual burial performed in the site, probably exclusively for members of a hierarchically important family of the ancient Herrera society. The search for homologous sequences in the American and European mtDNA data bases produced no identical coincidences, although a Brazilian Amazonic individual (similar to 4,000 YBP) was recorded with a matching sequence. Conclusion. Individuals buried in the Madrid 2-41 site were maternally closely related and showed a mtDNA sequence that is apparently absent in contemporary populations.",Article,"Silva, A.; Briceno, I.; Burgos, J.; Torres, D.; Villegas, V.; Gomez, A.; Bernal, J.E.; Rodriguez, J.V.",DNA; mitochondrial/analysis; polymorphism; single nucleotide; haplotypes; archaeology; indigenous population; Colombia,DNA;mitochondrial/analysis;polymorphism;single nucleotide;haplotypes;archaeology;indigenous population;Colombia;DEL-FUEGO-PATAGONIA;EXTINCT ABORIGINES;ANCIENT DNA;NEW-WORLD;MTDNA;POPULATIONS;LINEAGES;SEQUENCES;REGION,Colombia,2-s2.0-66549125939

Trust has long been highlighted as a key factor that can positively affect sustainable peace efforts by reducing intergroup hostility. Surprisingly, most post-conflict studies deal with trust as a dependent variable. Using a cross-sectional multi-method field study in Colombia, we assess the impact of trust on prospective reconciliation in the midst of an ongoing peace process. We find that trust in ex-combatants and in government increases the likelihood of having positive attitudes towards future reconciliation and willingness to support not only the peace process but reconciliation activities after war. We offer evidence supporting the idea that rather than drawing exclusively on economic and military capabilities, investing in local governance infrastructures that promote prosocial behaviour and positive belief management in the pre-reconciliation face offers a complementary alternative to help societies exit civil wars while tackling barriers to peacebuilding efforts in the initial stages of a post-conflict.",Article,"Casas-Casas, Andres.; Unknown.; Pino, Juan Federico",Colombia;peacebuilding;post-conflict risk management;prosocial behaviour;prospective reconciliation;trust,Colombia;peacebuilding;post-conflict risk management;prosocial behaviour;prospective reconciliation;trust,Colombia;United States;United States,

Methods: Data of people admitted into three major health institutions from an intermediate city in Colombia was collected. Socio-demographic characteristics, health care costs and alcohol consumption levels by breath alcohol concentration (BrAC) methodology were identified. Generalized linear models were applied to investigate whether alcohol consumption acts as an incremental factor for healthcare costs. Results: The average cost of healthcare was 878 USD. In general, there are differences between health care costs for patients with positive blood alcohol level compared with those who had negative levels. Univariate analysis shows that the average cost of care can be 2.26 times higher (95% Cl: 1.20-4.23), and after controlling for patient characteristics, alcohol consumption represents an incremental factor of almost 1.66 times (95% Cl: 1.05-2.62). Conclusions: Alcohol is identified as a possible factor associated with the increased use of direct health care resources. The estimates show the need to implement and enhance prevention programs against alcohol consumption among citizens, in order to mitigate the impact that traffic accidents have on their health status. The law enforcement to help reduce driving under the influence of alcoholic beverages could help to diminish the economic and social impacts of this problem. (C) 2014 Elsevier Ltd.

Methods: All patients first treated at the Institute Nacional de Cancerologia for breast or cervical cancer in the years 2007, 2010, 2012, without a prior cancer diagnosis, were included for the study. The hospital-based cancer registry was crosslinked with governmental databases to obtain follow-up information on all patients. Probability of surviving 24 months since the date of entry at the hospital was estimated using Kaplan-Meier methods, using the log-rank test to evaluate differences between groups. Results: We analyzed 1,928 breast cancer cases and 1,189 cervical cancer cases, resulting in an overall survival probability at 24 months of 79.6% (95% CI: 77.8-81.4) for BC and of 63.3% (95% CI: 60.6- 66.0) for cervical cancer, there were no differences in survival for year of entry. Advanced clinical stage substantial affected overall survival, being 32.2% (95% CI: 28.4-44.0) for stage IV breast cancer and 22.6% (95% CI: 11.4-33.8) for stage IV cervical cancer.

Many studies have been conducted with the aim to find natural compounds to fight cancer; however, chemotherapy is still the most widely used treatment despite side effects as harmful to patients. In this paper the antioxidant and cytotoxic capacity of Agraz extracts (Vaccinium meridionale) in OCI AML3 and MOLT4 cells using parallel Doxorubicin was evaluated. Extractions were made using 95% methanol, methanol-distilled water (1:1), distilled water and juice. Antioxidant capacity was performed by radical cation 2,2'-azinobis-3-ethylbenzothiazoline-6-sulfonic acid and 2,2-diphenyl-1-picryl-hydrazyl-hydrate methods, and phenols content was determined by Folin-Ciocalteu. The cytotoxic effect was evaluated on the viability of OCI AML3 and MOLT4 cells using 96-well plates for cell seeding by hemocytometer to 96h. The antioxidant capacity expressed as 50% inhibitory concentration was 1.7 ± 0.1 and 4.5 ± 0.4 mg/L for methanol extracts by radical 2,2-diphenyl-1-picryl-hydrazyl-hydrate and radical cation 2,2'-azinobis-3-ethylbenzothiazoline-6-sulfonic acid, respectively. The phenol content was found on 104.7 ± 4.0 and 1669.7 ± 82.6 mg AG/100g for the methanol extract and lyophilized juice, respectively.

Investigations of their spatial characteristics, systems of construction, and structural behavior, therefore, are also scarce. This lack of research has led to poor results in restoration attempts for these kinds of churches, which has caused the loss of important Colombian architectural and historical heritage. Additionally, Colombia is at a high seismic risk, and adobe and rammed-earth buildings are particularly vulnerable during earthquakes. This paper presents the results of an investigation of these kinds of structures, developed by the investigative groups investigation group on materials and structures (GRIME) and Estructuras & Construccion (at Pontificia Universidad Javeriana) during the period 2002-2013. The investigation focuses on churches in the geographical area within the central Colombian highlands built during the 16th and 17th centuries. The study takes an architectural and historical approach coupled with structural laboratory work (involving shake table tests on 1:50 models), where the authors applied a reinforcement alternative with confinement wood elements to improve the seismic performance of the structural system of rammed-earth churches. According to these results, the use of confining wood elements as reinforcements reduces the relative displacement induced by earthquakes to doctrinal earth-built churches and diminishes the propagation of cracks.

We analyzed the diversity and composition of the flora of 70 domestic gardens in seven localities in Bogota, Colombia, which represent different periods of expansion of the city. Floristic composition and diversity were related to the origin and use of plants, the urbanization history, and the income of owners. We recorded 4110 individuals belonging to 238 species. The mean species richness per garden was 15.4, with older localities having significantly higher species richness. The similarity among the localities, which evaluated the distinctness of assemblages, ranged from 0.42 to 0.50. Plants from the Neotropical region and exotic plants were the most abundant in all gardens. The most common use was ornamental, and use depended on the socioeconomic status of the owner. The lower-income homes cultivated larger proportions of edible and medicinal plants. Gardens at the oldest localities, with the largest number of native species, contribute to the conservation of flora because they contain the largest number of native species. Furthermore, domestic gardens are good sources of employment for gardeners and are useful places to keep senior citizens active, helping these citizens relieve stress, maintain good health and teach young people the cultural uses of plants.

We exploit regional variations in gross domestic product per capita (GDPpc) over the period 1980-2010 in Colombia to examine how changes in economic output relate to adult mortality. Methods: Data on the number of annual deaths at ages 20 years and older (n = 3,506,600) from mortality registries, disaggregated by age groups, sex and region, were linked to population counts for the period 1980-2010. We used region fixed effect models to examine whether changes in regional GDPpc were associated with changes in mortality. We carried out separate analyses for the periods 1980-1995 and 2000-2010 as well as by sex, distinguishing three age groups: 20-44 (predominantly young working adults), 45-64 (middle aged working adults), and 65+ (senior, predominantly retired individuals). Results: The association between regional economic conditions and mortality varied by period and age groups. From 1980 to 1995, increases in GDPpc were unrelated to mortality at ages 20 to 64, but they were associated with reductions in mortality for senior men. In contrast, from 2000 to 2010, changes in GDPpc were not associated with old age mortality, while an increase in GDPpc was associated with a decline in mortality at ages 20-44 years. Analyses restricted to regions with high registration coverage yielded similar albeit less precise estimates for most sub-groups. Conclusions: The relationship between business cycles and mortality varied by period and age in Colombia. Most notably, mortality shifted from being acyclical to being countercyclical for males aged 20-44, while it shifted from being countercyclical to being acyclical for males aged 65+.",Article,"Arroyave, I.; Hessel, P.; Burdorf, A.; Rodriguez-Garcia, J.; Cardona, D.; Avendano, M.",Mortality; Economic recession; Colombia; Developing countries; Health insurance,Mortality;Economic recession;Colombia;Developing countries;Health insurance;RECESSIONS GOOD;CYCLICALITY;INSURANCE;TIMES,Netherlands;Colombia;United Kingdom;United States,2-s2.0-84935037376

The purpose of this study was to analyse the variation in the vertical and spatial distribution of epiphytic bryophytes across four forests in the north-western Amazon. We sampled along the entire vertical gradient from tree base to upper canopy in order to answer these questions: Is there vertical zonation? Is there a relationship between composition species and geographical distance? Methods. The vertical gradient was studied in 64 phorophytes, and each phorophyte was divided into six height zones. We used Detrended Corresponded Analysis for plot ordination and Permutation Multivariate Analysis of Variance to analyse variation in species composition. The relationship between species composition and geographic distance was evaluated using a Mantel Test. We used Indicator species analysis to determine the preference of the species for each of the six height zones, and an ANOVA analysis to evaluate the significance of species richness per zone. Key results. There was a gradual differentiation of the bryophyte communities across the tree height zones. We identified 63 indicator species; the tree base had the highest number of indicator species, followed by the outer canopy. Conclusions. The strong influence of height zones on species assemblages revealed the importance of the environmental differences across the vertical gradient within a single tree. Epiphytic bryophyte communities are mainly structured according to the height zone of trees. The presence of a high percentage of indicator species across the Colombian Amazon is evidence to further support a high specificity of species for a particular microhabitat within the forest.",Article,"Campos, L.V.; de Oliveira, S.M.; Benavides, J.C.; Uribe-M.; J.; ter Steege, H.",Amazon; bryophytes; canopy; Colombia; epiphytes; indicator species; niche assembly; understory; vertical gradient,Amazon;bryophytes;canopy;Colombia;epiphytes;indicator species;niche assembly;understory;vertical gradient;TROPICAL RAIN-FOREST;ALTITUDINAL ZONATION;DISPERSAL;COMMUNITIES;AREA;METACOMMUNITIES;COLONIZATION;LICHENS;GUIANAS;BIOMASS,Colombia;Netherlands,2-s2.0-85071966182

We incorporated the variation associated with the ranking of institutions simulating its random effects under a binomial distribution. Methods: A nationwide survey on structure, technology, and staffing resources available in Colombian intensive care units during 1997-1998 was conducted. We collected data on admissions from 20 randomly selected adult medical and surgical intensive care units. Results: The mortality ratio from the 20 intensive care units ranged from 0.59 to 2.36; 80% of the intensive care units had a mortality ratio greater than 1. All four intensive care units with the lowest mortality ratio belonged to private institutions, while four of five institutions with the highest mortality belonged to the public sector. Intensive care units in private institutions also had fewer number of beds, lower median length of stay, lower occupancy rates, higher education training for specialists and nurses and fewer emergency nonelective surgical procedures. Conclusion: We successfully accounted for intensive care mortality baseline differences and random effects variations. There were substantial differences between intensive care units in institution type, bed availability, technology, staffing resources, and degree of training, which may have been associated with patient outcome. These results are of crucial importance to track, detect and assess future changes. (c) 2006 Elsevier Inc.

Nevertheless, an epiphyte's access to light may be limited by phorophyte shading and the spatio-temporal environmental patchiness characteristic of epiphytic habitats. We assessed the extent to which potential light interception in Rodriguezia granadensis, an epiphytic orchid, is determined by individual factors (plant size traits and leaf traits), or environmental heterogeneity (light patchiness) within the crown of the phorophyte, or both. We studied 104 adult plants growing on Psidium guajava trees in two habitats with contrasting canopy cover: a dry tropical forest edge, and isolated trees in a pasture. We recorded the number of leaves and the leaf area, the leaf position angles, and the potential exposure of the leaf surface to direct irradiance (silhouette area of the leaf blade), and the potential irradiance incident on each plant. We found the epiphytes experience a highly heterogeneous light environment in the crowns of P.guajava. Nonetheless, R.granadensis plants displayed a common light interception strategy typical of low-light environments, resembling terrestrial, forest understory plants. Potential exposure of the total leaf surface to direct irradiance correlated positively with plant size and within-plant variation in leaf orientation. In many-leaved individuals, within-plant variation in leaf angles produced complementary leaf positions that enhanced potential light interception. This light interception strategy suggests that, in contrast to current wisdom, enhancing light capture is important for vascular epiphytes in canopies with high spatio-temporal heterogeneity in light environments.",Article,"Ventre-Lespiaucq, A.B.; Delgado, J.A.; Ospina-Calderon, N.H.; Otero, J.T.; Escudero, A.; Sanchez, M.A.; Balaguer, L.; Flanagan, N.S.",Cauca Valley; Colombia; intra-individual trait variation; intra-specific trait variation; leaf angles; light interception strategy; Orchidaceae; plant size; Rodriguezia granadensis; vascular epiphytes,Cauca Valley;Colombia;intra-individual trait variation;intra-specific trait variation;leaf angles;light interception strategy;Orchidaceae;plant size;Rodriguezia granadensis;vascular epiphytes;FOREST UNDERSTORY PLANTS;PHYSIOLOGICAL ECOLOGY;CROWN ARCHITECTURE;VEGETATIVE GROWTH;CARBON GAIN;SIZE;CAPTURE;PHOTOSYNTHESIS;SIMULATION,Spain;Colombia,2-s2.0-85016419779

It is essential to identify which drugs offer the best value for their costs. Objectives To estimate comparative cost-effectiveness for treating diabetes mellitus with dulaglutide, liraglutide, or glargine in Colombia. Methods A Markov model including diabetic microvascular and macrovascular complications was used to estimate cost-effectiveness. We used annual cycles, a 5-year time horizon, 5% discount rate, and third-party payer's perspective. Main outcomes were quality-adjusted life-years (QALYs) and incremental cost-effectiveness ratios (ICERs). Transition probabilities were obtained from primary studies and costs from local databases and studies. We used a threshold of 3 times the Colombian per capita gross domestic product (US $17,270 for 2015; US $1 = 2,743 Columbian pesos) to assess cost-effectiveness. Results Total costs related to dulaglutide, liraglutide, and glargine were US $8,633, US $10,756, and US $5,783, yielding 3.311 QALYs, 3.229 QALYs, and 3.156 QALYs, respectively. Dulaglutide dominated liraglutide given lower total costs and higher QALYs. The estimated ICER for dulaglutide compared with glargine was US $18,385, greater than the accepted threshold. Sensibility analysis shows that decreased dulaglutide cost, increased consumption of glargine, nondaily injection, and number and cost of glucometry could result in ICERs lower than the threshold. Probabilistic sensitivity analysis showed consistent results. Conclusions This estimation indicates that dulaglutide dominates liraglutide. Its ICER is, however, greater than the accepted threshold for Colombia in base case compared with glargine. By increasing population weight or glargine consumption, dulaglutide becomes cost-effective compared with glargine, which could identify a niche where dulaglutide is the best option.",Article,"Lasalvia, Pieralessandro.; Unknown.; Unknown.; Castaneda-Cardona, Camilo.; Rosselli, Diego",Colombia;cost-effectiveness analysis;diabetes;dulaglutide;insulin glargine;liraglutide;quality-adjusted life-years,Colombia;cost-effectiveness analysis;diabetes;dulaglutide;insulin glargine;liraglutide;quality-adjusted life-years,Colombia;Colombia,

In high incidence countries, a historic cohort of the South Thames cancer registry was used as a minimally exposed population using the formula PAF = (observed incidence-incidence in minimally exposure)/observed incidence. In this study, we apply this method, constructing a minimally exposed cohort for Colombia and also using the historical South Thames data, using melanoma incidence data from the population-based cancer registry of Cali, Colombia for the period 1967-2012. The historic cohort incidence rates were very similar to those of Thames, but cohort effects were smaller for women and nonexistent for men. Age-specific incidence rates of these minimally exposed cohorts were applied to recent population numbers. For females, PAFs were 19% using the historic Thames cohort and 25% using the historic Cali cohort, corresponding numbers for males were 62% (vs. Thames) and 0% (vs. Cali). Taking into account the incidence rates of acral melanomas, which are not sun related, the PAF increased in women to 26% (vs. Thames) and 34% (vs. Cali) and for men 77% (vs. Thames).

We analyzed changes through time in red lists and red data books in Colombia in terms of evaluation systems, methods, and species composition. All five assessments used the International Union for Conservation of Nature (IUCN) system. Methods have progressed notably, from assessments 100% based on expert knowledge to assessments that use sophisticated analytical tools together with expert knowledge. A total of 62, 81, 89, 112 and 140 species were threatened in the years 1986, 1998, 2001, 2002 and 2016, respectively. Comparing assessments conducted in 2002 and 2016, the proportion of species in a category of threat under criterion A (rapid population decline) has declined, it is stable under criterion B (small, fragmented, and declining distribution), and has increased under criterion C (small and declining population). Agriculture, livestock farming, hunting and illegal trade, as well as illicit crops, are the most significant direct threats currently affecting 55%, 44%, 32%, and 31% of the species, respectively. This set of threats taken together suggests that the main direct threat for birds is the weakness of State control inin the country’s territories. The families Psittacidae, Grallariidae, and Cracidae are particularly sensitive.

The aim of this work was to analyze genetically the Checua group according to mitochondrial DNA HVR-I sequence data. Following strict criteria of authenticity for studies of ancient DNA, extracted DNA was amplified and sequenced for each of the human remains. Twelve of the 22 human remains from Checua were successfully assessed (54.54%) in this study. Paleo-Colombian Checua revealed the Native American haplogroups A2, B2 and C1, plus the rare haplogroup D4h3a, reported for the first time in ancient Colombia. Comparison between Paleo-American and modern Colombian genetic data demonstrates the continuity of A2, B2, and C1, and a probable discontinuity of D4h3a since prehistoric times in Colombia, if not a shortage of D4h3a records in the literature and/or databases, while D1 is present in modern Colombia.

Although Colombia is a country displaying enormous biological diversity, few studies have been conducted from the perspective of the population genetics of Trypanosoma cruzi. This study was carried out using 23 Colombian stocks of this protozoan, analysed for 13 isoenzyme loci. The main population genetic results were: (1) Colombia is one of the distribution areas where T. cruzi appears to have the highest genetic variability and heterogeneity in Latin America; (2) the Pgm locus was found in fixed heterozygosis, supporting the presence of diploidy in this organism; (3) the absence of segregating genotypes and the absence of Hardy - Weinberg equilibrium support the view of the existence of a clonal structure as claimed by Tibayrenc and Ayala. Nevertheless, one characteristic of clonal structure, that of over-representation of some identical zymodemes in vast areas of varying environmental conditions, was not found in Colombia. In this country, a strong spatial autocorrelation, with a classic structure of regional patches, was observed.",Article,"Ruiz-Garcia, Manuel.; Montilla, Marleny.; Unknown.; Unknown.; Alvarez, Diana",Clonal structure;Colombia;Population genetics;Trypanosoma cruzi,Clonal structure;Colombia;Population genetics;Trypanosoma cruzi,Colombia;Colombia,

These studies have shown a great diversity of positions among participants, ranging from ""zero tolerability"" to ""non-zero tolerability"", to high tolerance to favoritism, and to complete tolerability. The present study analyzed Colombian lay persons' views as a function of three separate factors characterizing acts of corruption: (a) the current status or position in society of the person who behaved in a corrupt way (politician, judge, entrepreneur or ordinary citizen), (b) the motive behind the act of corruption (nepotism or monetary gain), and (c) the means used for obtaining the underserved benefit (threatening the person, bribery or illicitly sharing of confidential information). As expected, four qualitatively different perspectives were identified. The first one (60 % of the participants) was the expected Zero Tolerance view because all acceptability ratings were extremely low. The second one (32 %) was called Never Very Tolerable because ratings, although always low, varied as a function of the means used: Threat and bribery were considered as more intolerable than use of information. The third one (7 %) was called Depends on Means because the ratings were affected by the means used to a larger extent than in the preceding case. The fourth one (1 %) was called Always Tolerable because in all cases, the ratings were high. In no cases did acceptability depend much on the status of the person performing the corrupt act or of the motives behind the act.

Introductions of megafaunal species are rare and may contribute to rewilding efforts, but they may also have pronounced socio-ecological effects because of their scale of influence. A recent introduction of the hippopotamus Hippopotamus amphibius into Colombia is a novel introduction of a megaherbivore onto a new continent, and raises questions about the future dynamics of the socio-ecological system into which it has been introduced. Here we synthesize current knowledge about the Colombian hippopotamus population, review the literature on the species to predict potential ecological and socio-economic effects of this introduction, and make recommendations for future study. Hippopotamuses can have high population growth rates (7-11%) and, on the current trajectory, we predict there could be 400-800 individuals in Colombia by 2050. The hippopotamus is an ecosystem engineer that can have profound effects on terrestrial and aquatic environments and could therefore affect the native biodiversity of the Magdalena River basin. Hippopotamuses are also aggressive and may pose a threat to the many inhabitants of the region who rely upon the Magdalena River for their livelihoods, although the species could provide economic benefits through tourism.

We illustrate with Colombia in the Pacific Alliance. In that case, the CTB index should be preferred to eight other representative RCA indexes. Therefore, the CTB index might be useful for empirical analysis, besides its theoretical relevance.

This 'located' approach shows that generalizations about gender implications of conditional cash transfer programmes in Latin America do not always fit neatly with realities. The article shows how the implementation of these programmes in a specific rural context, the municipality of Paipa, reflects a reinforcement of traditional gender allocations and responsibilities. At the same time, the local authorities, official workers and the mothers adapt the social programmes to recent gender trends. For example, men may carry out some domestic activities single-handedly, take care of children without their wives, women may leave men, and women and men may work together in off-farm activities, with husbands and wives taking joint decisions about domestic issues. In other words, the gender effects of the Familias en Accion programme in rural settings currently move between old gender customs and practices and changeable gender conditions. In Latin-American terms, it is possible to say that these conditions range between 'machismo' and 'feminist liberalization'.",Article,"Quijano, M.A.F.",Social policy; Familias en Accion; Gender; Poverty; Paipa; Colombia,Social policy;Familias en Accion;Gender;Poverty;Paipa;Colombia,Colombia,2-s2.0-67650630238

The hearing lossin the island was characterized as non-syndromic autosomal recessive deafness accounting for 47% (8/17) of the deaf population, Waardenburg Syndrome (deafness associated with pigmentary anomalies) for 29% (5/17), and the remaining 24% (4/17) are cases of sporadic non-syndromic deafness. For appropriate genetic counseling a complete pedigree of families with deaf individuals was constructed. The 35delG mutation in GJB2 gene, which encodes connexin 26 (Cx26), is responsible for the deafness observed in the 8 individuals with autosomal recessive non-syndromic hearing loss. The deaf individuals with Waardenburg Syndrome and the sporadic cases did not have this mutation. Therefore, we present here an atypical case of an isolated community with at least two different genetic etiologies for deafness: non-syndromic genetic deafness caused by the 35delG mutation in the GJB2 gene and deafness associated with Waardenburg Syndrome not related to GJB2. In a small and isolated population, it is feasible to assume that the deafness is caused by the same factor, however, Providencia is an atypical case.

Methodology: A cross-sectional study and a nested case-control study were carried out between 2009 and 2010 involving two Colombian subpopulations: children/adolescents and adults. Cases were affirmative respondents to “In the past 12 months, have you (or your child) had a problem with sneezing or a running or blocked nose, when you (or your child) did not have a cold or the flu?” “Controls” were subjects who never had been diagnosed with asthma, AR or atopic eczema by a physician, and whom did not report any symptoms in the past twelve months. Weighted logistic regression was used to assess the association of different factors with case/control status. Results: Factors associated with AR in children/adolescents were family history of AR, acetaminophen consumption and high socioeconomic status. Among adults, family history of asthma, AR and atopic eczema, and cetaminophen consumption were associated with AR. Consumption of cereals among children/adolescents and eating eggs among adults showed protective associations.

In Colombia, montane regions are dominated by varying intensities of agriculture and high levels of biodiversity and endemism. Globally, Colombia has the second largest number of amphibian species and is also the third largest coffee producer. Our study region, the Sierra Nevada de Santa Marta (SNSM), has high levels of amphibian endemism (38% and 10 threatened endemics) and is the fourth largest coffee growing region in Colombia. The SNSM rises from the sea to 5,775 m in just 42 km, with a direct overlap between coffee and amphibian habitat occurring across 600-1,800 m. We examined how land cover and elevation (from 800 to 3,700 m asl) influenced amphibian community structure, species richness, and abundance. We conducted surveys from September 2017 to July 2018 at 35 transects across five major land cover types: forest, ecotone, paramo, pasture, and shade coffee. In total, we recorded 19 species (366 individuals; 16 endemic species). Land cover was the main determinant of amphibian community structure, while the interaction between elevation and land cover was the main determinant of species richness and abundance. Forest and ecotone contained 73% of overall richness (14 species) with one species found exclusively in ecotone and three exclusively in forest. Pasture and coffee supported 42% (8 species) of species with only two species found exclusively at these land cover types. Shade coffee had low species richness and abundance and we detected just one endemic species in this land cover. The preservation of ecotone, transitional degraded habitat that occurs between two or more types of contiguous land cover types, represents an opportunity to safeguard microhabitats and microclimates. Conservation in the region should be collaborative and include private landowners, NGO's, government agencies, and academics. Conservation actions should prioritize protecting extant natural habitat, restoring degraded habitats, increasing the heterogeneity of production systems, and improving landscape connectivity and watershed health. To achieve those actions, local communities will require economic incentives to maintain forest cover and reduce the contamination of streams through agricultural runoff. (C) 2020 The Authors.

Design: We classified children <5 years old according to height-for-age Z-score (<-2) and BMI-for-age Z-score (>2) to assess stunting and overweight/obesity, respectively; mothers were categorized according to BMI to assess underweight (<18.5 kg/m(2)) and overweight/obesity (>= 25-0 kg/m(2)). At the household level, we established four final anthropometric typologies: normal, underweight, overweight and dual-burden households. Separate polytomous logistic regression models for each of the surveyed years were developed to examine several maternal and familial determinants of the different anthropometric typologies. Setting: National and sub-regional (urban and rural) representative samples from Colombia, South America. Subjects: Drawing on data from three waves of Colombia's Demographic and Health Survey/Encuesta Nacional de Salud (DHS/ENDS), we examined individual and household information from mothers (18-49 years) and their children (birth-5 years). Results: Higher parity was associated with an increased likelihood of overweight and dual burden. Higher levels of maternal education were correlated with lower prevalence of overweight, underweight and dual burden of malnutrition in all data collection waves. In 2010, participation in nutrition programmes for children <5 years, being an indigenous household, food purchase decisions by the mother and food security classification were also associated with the four anthropometric typologies.

This paper presents a composite index of intermediary determinants of child health using a multivariate statistical approach. The index shows how specific determinants of child health vary across Colombian departments (administrative subdivisions). We used data collected from the 2010 Colombian Demographic and Health Survey (DHS) for 32 departments and the capital city, Bogota. Adapting the conceptual framework of Commission on Social Determinants of Health (CSDH), five dimensions related to child health are represented in the index: material circumstances, behavioural factors, psychosocial factors, biological factors and the health system. In order to generate the weight of the variables, and taking into account the discrete nature of the data, principal component analysis (PCA) using polychoric correlations was employed in constructing the index. From this method five principal components were selected. The index was estimated using a weighted average of the retained components. A hierarchical cluster analysis was also carried out. The results show that the biggest differences in intermediary determinants of child health are associated with health care before and during delivery.

Recently, bat-associated spirochaetes have been reported as human pathogens. In 1968, a spirochaete was detected in blood of the bat Natalus tumidirostris captured inside the Macaregua cave, Colombia. Data on this microorganism were never published again. The aim of this study was to evaluate the presence of Borrelia DNA in blood from bats of Macaregua cave. We performed molecular analyses using a genus-specific real-time PCR targeting the 16S rRNA to detect DNA of Borrelia in blood samples from 46 bats captured in the Macaregua cave. Positive samples were submitted to a battery of PCRs aiming to amply Borrelia 16S rRNA, flaB, glpQ, p66, ospC, clpA, clpX, nifS, pepX, pyrG, recG, rplB and uvrA genes. Seventeen samples were positive for Borrelia after real-time PCR. With the exception of flaB gene, attempts to amplify further loci were unsuccessful. Nucleotide and amino acid divergences of four flaB haplotypes characterized from blood of Carollia perspicillata showed Borrelia burgdorferi sensu lato (Bbsl) as the most closely related group. A phylogenetic tree including 74 sequences of the genus confirmed this trend, since Borrelia genotypes detected in bats from Macaregua formed a monophyletic group basally positioned to Bbsl. Our results suggest that Borrelia genotypes characterized from bats roosting in the Macaregua cave might constitute a new taxon within the genus. This is the first molecular characterization of a Borrelia sp. in Colombia.",Article,"Munoz-Leal, S.; Faccini-Martinez, A.A.; Perez-Torres, J.; Chala-Quintero, S.M.; Herrera-Sepulveda, M.T.; Cuervo, C.; Labruna, M.B.",Borrelia; Borrelia burgdorferi; chiroptera; Colombia; Ornithodoros; Spirochaetales,Borrelia;Borrelia burgdorferi;chiroptera;Colombia;Ornithodoros;Spirochaetales;BORNE RELAPSING FEVER;PHYLOGENETIC ANALYSIS,Chile;Brazil;Colombia,2-s2.0-85096675133

Methods: to model the expected incidence of colorectal cancer in the hypothetical situation of no red and processed meat consumption in Colombia, for the year 2010. A dynamic macrosimulation model, PREVENT 3.01, was used to integrate available cancer incidence, meat consumption prevalence and associated risk data and to evaluate the impact of eliminating red and processed meat from the Colombian diet on national colorectal cancer incidence. Results: Eliminating consumption of red meat altogether from the Colombian diet resulted in reductions in age-standardized colorectal cancer incidence, translating in reductions of 331 males (PAF 13%) and 297 female cases (PAF 10%). Eliminating processed meats had slightly stronger effects, with decreases of 362 males (PAF 14%) and 388 female cases (PAF 13%).

In this article, the implementation of the REDD Early Movers- REM/Visión Amazonia program in Guaviare, Colombia, is analyzed, focusing on the implementation challenges and scope of the program when addressing deforestation drivers in a post-conflict context. By taking a historical perspective on regional deforestation challenges in Guaviare, we link these challenges to the recent deforestation trends in the region. This article demonstrates the particular challenges to implementing REDD+ in the Colombian post-conflict context related to the power vacuum left by the FARC retreat, land grabbing for speculation and cattle ranching, power asymmetries and corrupted regional elites. The article concludes that the current scope of REM does not sufficiently address the main drivers of deforestation, and that REM's focus on campesinos and indigenous communities will not significantly reduce the substantial deforestation rates in the present post-conflict context.",Article,"Rodriguez-de-Francisco, Jean Carlo.; Del Cairo, Carlos.; Unknown.; Unknown.; Unknown.; Hein, Jonas",Amazon;Colombia;Deforestation;Post-conflict;Power;REDD+,Amazon;Colombia;Deforestation;Post-conflict;Power;REDD+,Colombia;Germany;Belgium;Germany;Colombia,WOS:000637216300010

In addition, species may exhibit plasticity in habitat use, with the result that densities vary in different habitats. The Cauca Guan (Penelope perspicax) is an endangered species endemic to the mid-Cauca Valley in Colombia. To assess spatial variation in population densities, we surveyed different habitat types (mature and secondary forest, early regeneration, and vegetation strips along streams) in three sites and compared them to densities reported in previous studies to explore possible changes over a period of several years. At the three sites, densities varied between 10 and 40 birds/km(2) in different habitats. Variation in population density may be related to forest area and habitat productivity, but guans are known to move among locales and regions in response to temporal fluctuations in resource availability. Cauca Guan densities are comparable to those of other montane Penelopine guans with broader geographic distributions. Although the Cauca Guan is not a habitat specialist and may reach high densities under some conditions, globally this guan remains rare and efforts for its conservation should be sustained.",Article,"Kattan, G.H.; Roncancio, N.; Banguera, Y.; Kessler-Rios, M.; Londono, G.A.; Marin, O.H.; Munoz, M.C.",Cracidae; Colombia; endangered species; endemicity; population density,Cracidae;Colombia;endangered species;endemicity;population density;CENTRAL ANDES;CLOUD-FOREST;NATURAL-HISTORY;HABITAT USE;ABUNDANCE;RARITY,Colombia;United States;Germany,2-s2.0-84897876090

S. alvarezlopezi is easily diagnosable from its near relatives by its song and mitochondrial DNA; differences in plumage exist but are more subtle. The species inhabits dense understory vegetation on the floors and lower slopes of ravines in cloud forest at elevations of 1,300 to 2,100 m. On the Pacific slope, its altitudinal distribution is sandwiched between those of S. chocoensis (below) and S. vicinior (above); the latter in turn is replaced higher up by S. spillmanni and S. latrans, but S. alvarezlopezi also occurs at similar to 2,000-2,100 m on eastern slopes just below the low ridgeline. All of the latter species are distinguished by vocal and plumage characters. Marked sexual differences in plumage exist in stilesi, but females have yet to be collected for alvarezlopezi and rodriguezi.

Here, we argue for refocusing attention on territorialization processes as a means of understanding the dynamics and consequences of contestation between vulnerable minority communities and powerful groups. Focusing on the majority Afro-Colombian city of Buenaventura in the Pacific coastal region, which is simultaneously Colombia’s most significant port and one of its most neglected cities, we explore processes of de- and re-territorialization. Beyond tropes of displacement and resistance, territorialization offers a conceptual lens for understanding territorial struggles as complex events, in terms of the physical and symbolic effects of de-territorialization on communities and individuals, and re-territorialization as plural, disruptive practices of re-existence. This suggests the need to focus on everyday experiences as well as specific time- and space-bound moments of struggle.

Incentives for individual producers are the classic policy response for a socially efficient balance between livelihoods and the environment. Yet monitoring individual miners is ineffective, or it is very costly, especially on frontiers with scattered small-scale miners. We ask whether monitoring at a group level effectively incentivizes cleaner artisanal mining by combining lower-cost external monitoring with local collective action. We employ a mining-framed, threshold-public-goods experiment in Colombia's Pacific region, with 640 participants from frontier mining communities. To study compliance with collective environmental targets, we vary the target stringency, including to compare increases over time in the stringency versus decreases. We find that collective incentives can induce efficient equilibria, with group compliance - and even inefficient overcompliance - despite the existence of equilibria with zero contributions. Yet, for demanding targets in which the reward for compliance barely outweighs the cost, compliance can collapse. Those outcomes improve with past successes for easier targets, however, so our results suggest gain from building coordination via graduated stringency. (C) 2019 Elsevier Inc.

We investigated the prevalence of probable sarcopenia, defined as weak grip strength, in community dwelling older Colombian adults, and examined the long-term associated conditions. Design: Cross-sectional study. Setting: Urban and rural Colombian older adults from the ""Estudio Nacional de Salud, Bienestar y Envejecimiento (SABE) study"". Participants: 5237 Colombian older adults aged >60 years. Measurements: Probable sarcopenia was assessed following the cut-off points for weak grip strength recommended by EWGSOP2 guidelines. Odds ratios (ORs) of the relationship between long-term conditions and probable sarcopenia were determined using logistic regression. Results: The prevalence of probable sarcopenia defined as weak grip strength was 46.5% [95% confidence interval (CI), 45.1-47.8]. Physical inactivity ""proxy"" (OR 1.35, 95% CI 1.14-1.59); diabetes (OR 1.32, 95% CI 1.11-1.56); and arthritis, osteoarthritis, and rheumatism (OR 1.44, 95% CI 1.25-1.67) were independently associated with probable sarcopenia. Conclusions and Implications: We found that almost half of all the Colombian older adults in our sample had probable sarcopenia. Individuals with physical inactivity, diabetes, arthritis, or osteoarthritis and rheumatism had a higher prevalence of probable sarcopenia. Probable sarcopenia is clinically highly relevant, and several of the factors associated with this condition are potentially preventable, treatable, and reversible.

Large-scale genetic association studies have identified variants robustly associated with BC risk in European women. We examine here the relevance of these variants to Colombian BC and possible interactions with genetic ancestry. Native American, European and African proportions were estimated for 1022 Colombian BC cases and 1023 controls. Logistic regression was applied to assess the association between 78 variants and BC risk and interactions between the variants and ancestry proportions. We constructed a multifactorial risk score combining established BC risk factors, associated risk variants and individual ancestry proportions. Each 1% increase in the Native American proportion translated into a 2.2% lower BC risk (95% CI: 1.4-2.9). Thirteen variants were associated with BC in Colombian women, with allele frequencies and risk effects partially different from European women. Ancestry proportions moderated the risk effects of two variants. The ability of Native American proportions to separate Colombian cases and controls (area-under-the-curve (AUC) = 0.61) was similar to the discriminative ability of family history of BC in first-degree female relatives (AUC = 0.58) or the combined effect of all 13 associated risk variants (AUC = 0.57).

Methods: A cost utility analysis performed on the results of an RCT conducted in Bogota, Colombia between 1993 and 1996. Hospital and ambulatory costs were estimated by microcosting in a sample of preterm infants from a University Hospital in Bogota in 2011 and at a KMC clinic in the same period. Utility scores were assigned by experts by means of (1) direct ordering and scoring discrete health states and (2) constructing a multi-attribute utility function. Ninety-five percent confidence intervals (CIs) for the incremental cost utility ratios (ICURs) were computed by the Fiellers theorem method. One-way sensitivity analysis on price estimates for valuing costs was performed. Results: ICUR at 1 year of corrected age was $ -1,546 per extra quality-adjusted life year gained using the KMC method (95% CI $ -7,963 to $ 4,910). Conclusion: In Bogota, the use of KMC is dominant: more effective and cost-saving.

Chapman,"The processes of bird diversification in South America have long been a focus of evolutionary biologists and this paper partly acts as an introduction to a selection of such work published in the Biological Journal of the Linnean Society and collated into a Virtual Issue (). At the beginning of the 20(th) century, Frank M. Chapman, curator of birds at the American Museum of Natural History, conducted a series of expeditions in Colombia and Ecuador to discover the geographic origins of South American bird-life'. The expeditions produced almost 30 000 specimens, obtained in a sampling scheme aimed at revealing the geographical and elevational distributions of birds. Chapman proposed a series of ideas about the evolutionary origins of the tropical Andean avifauna. Despite being nearly 100years old, Chapman's evolutionary hypotheses on the role of the appearance of new environments and geographical barriers on speciation, have an enduring influence. With the development of molecular methods and tools for the study of the mechanisms and timing of speciation events, Chapman's hypotheses have seen a revival in the recent scientific literature. Recent work has provided support for some of Chapman's hypotheses, but has also revealed greatly complex processes of biotic differentiation in the Neotropics. What is remarkable is that with means that today seem precarious, Chapman envisioned evolutionary processes at a continental scale that remain valid, in fields that currently advance at an accelerated rhythm and soon render older ideas obsolete.",Review,"Kattan, G.H.; Tello, S.A.; Giraldo, M.; Cadena, C.D.",American Museum; biological history; Colombia; Ecuador; evolutionary barriers,American Museum;biological history;Colombia;Ecuador;evolutionary barriers;SOUTH-AMERICA;ANDEAN UPLIFT;DIVERSIFICATION;SPECIATION;AVES;BIOGEOGRAPHY;PHYLOGENY;FOREST;VICARIANCE;AMAZONIA,Colombia,2-s2.0-84958778597

Recently, serologic studies in human and animals conducted in Colombian Orinoquia, showed a high seroprevalence against SFGR. In June 2015, a 50-year-old male was admitted to a hospital in Bogota, Colombia, with two days of malaise and temperature of 39 degrees C, associated to generalized rash 24 h after the onset of fever. He referred a work visit and outdoor activities in rural area of the Department of Meta 15 days prior the onset of symptoms. The patient was transferred to the intensive care unit with supplementary oxygen, inotropic support and was assessed by the infectious diseases department, indicating the addition of Doxycycline. After seven days of antibiotic treatment the patient was discharged with no evidence of new symptoms or sequels. Retrospectively, two serum samples collected during the acute and convalescent phase were evaluated; there was four fold rise in titer against SFGR. With the foregoing, associated with the recent serological evidence that suggests the circulation of SFGR species in the Colombian Orinoquia, we consider to recognize this region as a new endemic area for SFG Rickettsioses.

The objective of this study was to document the magnitude, principal characteristics, and impact of this phenomenon in the selected population. A semi-structured survey was employed to collect information from 66 individuals linked to the universities. A total of 45 cases of suicide were documented in the study period (2004-2014). Of these, 69% occurred in males and 31% in females. The age range was 17-27 years, with 62% of the cases in the 19-22 year-old group. The most common mechanisms employed were suffocation and poisoning, followed by intentional falls, use of a firearm, and drug overdose. The selected location was the place of residence in 52% of cases and the university campus in 16% of cases. The distribution of students by area of knowledge showed a predominance of social and human science (44%) followed by engineering (22%). A history of difficulties in family and affective relationships was common among victims, as was a history of exposure to intolerance of differences in sexual orientation.

Objective: To quantify total and average years of life lost due to cancer in Colombia, and to investigate changes in this burden between 1997 and 2012. Materials and methods: We obtained sex-specific data on age distribution, remaining life expectancy, deaths due to specific cancers and total number of deaths from the Colombian Departamento Administrativo Nacional de Estadisticas. We calculated years of life lost based on each individual's age at death and the remaining life expectancy at that age; as for average years of life, we divided these by the number of deaths due to specific cancers. Results: The total number of cancer deaths increased by 33% between 1997 and 2012, comprising 15% of male and 20% of female deaths in the period 2010-2012. Total years of life lost due to cancer increased by 25.1% for males and 31.1% for females over the study period. The highest increases (>40%) were observed for colorectal, pancreas and kidney cancers in both sexes, for melanomas and bladder cancer in men, and for breast and ovarian cancer in women. Trends in average years of life lost were stable. Almost half (48-50%) of the years of life lost due to childhood cancers were due to leukemia.

We evaluated screening accuracy and factors related to program implementation in Bogota, Colombia. Between 2008 and 2012 participants underwent clinical breast examination (CBE) and mammography. Positive results underwent histological verification. Adherence to screening protocols was analyzed. Sensitivity, specificity, and predictive values were estimated and adjusted by overdiagnosis. Impact of alternative screening algorithms on follow-up was explored, including combined screening tests and modified coding systems for mammography. In total, 7436 women aged 50-69 were enrolled; 400 discontinued and 1003 non-compliant with screening protocols. 23 cancer cases were diagnosed. Mammography sensitivity and specificity were 78.3% (95% CI 77.3-99.3) and 99.4% (95% CI 99.2-99.6). CBE sensitivity was 39.1% (95% CI 37.9-40.3) and specificity 83.4% (95% CI 82.6-84.3). Parallel mammography and CBE showed the highest sensitivity (95.6%) and combined as serial tests the lowest (positive CBE followed by mammography 13.0%). A simplified coding system for mammography (recall/ no-recall) had 6.3% of positive results and a minor reduction in specificity compared with standard mammography, but reported the best balance between recall rates and screening protocol compliance.

The objective of the present study was to evaluate the impact of the HACCP system in slaughterhouses in Colombia on reducing Salmonella spp. exposure due to the consumption of fresh pork meat. Two slaughtering plants with a different degree of HACCP implementation were selected and a quantitative microbiological mapping was built by collecting 820 samples of Salmonella spp. enumeration at different processing stages. The overall Salmonella spp. mean concentration was 1.15 +/- 0.55 log MPN/g, with no significant differences among plants (P > 0.05). Deficiencies during carcass disinfection and temperature during distribution of meat cuts from the slaughterhouse lacking of HACCP resulted in a significant increase of Salmonella spp. prevalence (20-40%) (P < 0.05). Processing stages with the highest pathogen prevalence were transport (28-32%) and hanging (16-36%). The exposure assessment model estimated a higher degree of pathogen contamination at the time of consumption in meat cuts from the slaughterhouse without HACCP (3.36 versus 3.68 log MPN/g) and 10-fold increase in the probability a consumer would acquire a contaminated portion (0.011 versus 0.105).

Objective: Determine the genetic diversity of skeletal remains associated with the Sun Temple and their relationship with other contemporary and ancient communities of America. Materials and methods: 13 Pre-Columbian Individuals belonging to precolombian Muisca Period (IX-XVI centuries b. C.) from the vicinities of the Sun Temple (Sogamoso -Boyaca) in the eastern Colombian Andes were analyzed. mtDNA was amplified and RFLPs were performed in order to type the 4 Amerindian haplogroups (A, B, C and D). In addition, autosomal markers including amelogenin and Y-Chromosome STRs were amplified. Results: Among the observed mitochondrial lineages, haplogroup A was the most frequent, followed by haplogroups B and C; no evidence of haplogroup D was found.

Objective: Determine the genetic diversity of skeletal remains associated with the Sun Temple and their relationship with other contemporary and ancient communities of America. Materials and methods: 13 Pre-Columbian Individuals belonging to precolombian Muisca Period (IX-XVI centuries b. C.) from the vicinities of the Sun Temple (Sogamoso -Boyacá) in the eastern Colombian Andes were analyzed. mtDNA was amplified and RFLPs were performed in order to type the 4 Amerindian haplogroups (A, B, C and D). In addition, autosomal markers including amelogenin and Y-Chromosome STRs were amplified.

Methods: A survival analysis was performed on data from patients with invasive stomach cancer (SC), breast cancer (BC), cervical cancer (CC), and colorectal cancer (CRC) treated in the INC in the year 2012. Data were taken from the hospital cancer register and the deaths register from the INC and government sources. Frequencies and measures of central tendency and dispersion were calculated. The overall survival at two years from the date of admission was estimated using Kaplan-Meier methods and was compared using the Log-rank Test. Results: A total of 1,793 cancer cases were analysed. The estimated survival at two years for the 2012 cohort was 29.4% (95% CI 24.9 -33.9) for SC; 80.8% (95% CI: 77.9 -83.7) for BC; 62.3% (95% CI: 57.0 -67.6) for CC, and 54.1% (95% CI 49.0 -59.2) for CRC. The median survival time could only be determined for SC, and was 9.6 months. Conclusions: Two year survival at INC was highest for BC, and very low for SC, and were within expectations compared to the literature. These data provide a reference on the prognosis for these cancers in Colombia, and as a baseline for monitoring overall cancer survival. The trends in survival over time may indicate advances in care. (C) 2017 Institut Nacional de Cancerologia. Published by Elsevier Espana, S.L.U.

In this report, the Y-chromosome haplotype is determined and statistical analyses are performed to improve databases of Colombian Y-chromosome for comparison with relatives of the male line. Objective: Characterization of haplotypes through analysis of Y-chromosome STR molecular markers in a sample of Colombian Cundiboyacense highland population. Methods: From the ""Program of blood Bank from officials at the Attorney General's Office (FGN)"", 74 samples were randomly selected from individuals who reported no paternal relationship with each other and whose paternal geographic origin belonged at least for two generations to the departments of Cundinamarca and Boyaca. Seventeen (17) tandem repeat polymorphisms in the Y chromosome were amplified and typed (DYS456, DYS389I, DYS390, DYS389II, DYS458, DYS19, DYS385a/b, DYS393, DYS391, DYS439, DYS635, DYS392, Y-GATA-H4, DYS437, DYS438, and DYS448). Results: Distribution of allele and haplotype frequencies for the 17 markers were analyzed: 71 haplotypes were determined with 17 Y-STR markers of which 68 were unique and 3 were observed in two individuals, with a single shared haplotype for the two departments of the Cundiboyacense Plateau. The haplotype diversity for the sample population was 99.9% with a discrimination power of 95.9% and random match probability of 1.5%. The comparison of the two populations together had no significant differences, and therefore no regional specificity was found in allele frequencies between Cundinamarca and Boyaca. Discussion: The values of haplotype diversity, discrimination power, and probability of random coincidence showed the usefulness of Y-STR analysis in cases of patrilineal descent and are consistent with values observed in the early development of haplotype databases.

Objective: To estimate the prevalence of HBP, knowledge, treatment and control in population aged >= 60 years, resident in Colombia, according to their ethnic condition. Methods: Population sample selected by multistage sampling. Ethnicity was defined based on skin color. HBP was defined as systolic blood pressure >= 140, and/or diastolic blood pressure >= 90 mm Hg, and/or the participants' self-report. Controlled HBP at a blood pressure value < 140/90, knowledge and treatment were identified by self-report. Results: 23,694 adults aged >= 60 years were included, of which 54.5%, 34.5% and 10.9% were respectively identified as having light, medium or dark skin color; 54.5% were women, and 78.1% resided in urban areas. The standardized prevalence of HBP, by age, was 57.7% (95% CI: 55.2 -60.2); 51.4% (95% CI: 47.3-55. 5), in men; and 62.9% (60.964.9), in women.

Psorophora columbiae and Ps. toltecum are two of the main vectors of Venezuelan equine encephalitis. We found no conspicuous genetic differences between the two species. The relatively high gene flow levels among these populations indicate that these are not two different species or that there has been recent divergence between these taxa. In addition, no global differential selection among the loci was detected, although the α-GDH locus showed significantly less genefic heterogeneity than the remaining loci, which could mean that homogenizing natural selection acts at this locus. No isolation by distance was detected among the populations, and a spatial population analysis showed opposite spatial trends among the 31 alleles analyzed. Multiregression analyses showed that both expected heterozygosity and the average number of alleles per locus were totally determined by three variables: altitude, temperature and size of the human population at the locality.

Because most coral populations are self-feeding, a breakdown in recruitment would lead to local extinction. Recruitment indirectly affects both renewal and maintenance of existing and future coral communities, coral reef biodiversity (bottom-up effect) and therefore coral reef resilience. This process has been used as an indirect measure of individual reproductive success (fitness) and is the final stage of larval dispersal leading to population connectivity. As a result, recruitment has been proposed as an indicator of coral-reef health in marine protected areas, as well as a central aspect of the decision-making process concerning management and conservation. The creation of management plans to promote impact mitigation, rehabilitation and conservation of the Colombian coral reefs is a necessity that requires firstly, a review and integration of existing literature on scleractinian coral recruitment in Colombia and secondly, larger scale field studies. This motivated us to summarize and analyze all existing information on coral recruitment to determine the state of knowledge, isolate patterns, identify gaps, and suggest future lines of research.",Review,"Acosta, Alberto.; Unknown.; Pizarro, Valeria",Colombia;Coral;Density;Juvenile;Monitoring;Recruitment;Reef;Richness;Scleractinia;Structure,Colombia;Coral;Density;Juvenile;Monitoring;Recruitment;Reef;Richness;Scleractinia;Structure,Colombia;Colombia;Colombia,

Factors responsible for forest change included human activities and river dynamics. Although most of the deforestation was related to human disturbance, almost 27 per cent of forest losses were due to channel migration of the Meta River. HCM forests were the most affected land cover since they are easily accessed, viable for logging and occurred on fertile soils, which are valuable for agriculture. LCM forests were less affected since their soil fertilities and inundation regimes were unfavourable to human uses, and thus, less prone to anthropogenic disturbances.

,,,6,2-s2.0-85066859779,2019,'We just been forced to do it': Exploring victimization and agency among internally displaced young mothers in Bogotá,"Background: Armed conflict in Colombia has a history of 50 years that continues to this day. According to the Victims Record of Colombia, from 1985 to 2013 2.683.335 women have been victims of the armed conflict. Women have been described as the main victims of the armed conflict, especially in the Colombian cultural context that in some regions is still considered to be a 'machista' and patriarchal one. In contrast, some authors have explicitly stressed Colombian women's agency instead of positioning them only as victims. Some of them are described as 'survivors' of the war, emphasizing their impressive resistance to the outcomes of war and forced displacement. In contrast to the background of these scholarly discussions, our study focused on how displaced women living in Bogotá themselves articulate their experiences of agency and victimization. This paper will therefore explore how women, in reconstructing their life stories, expressed the tussles between victimization and agency. Methods: We used qualitative methods conducted within an ethnographic approach. Based on ten years of experience in the neighborhood and one year of fieldwork, we collected the life stories of twenty internally displaced mothers, and ran eight workshops with them. We analyzed the narratives with a specific focus on how women expressed victimization and agency in four important periods in their life that related to the process of displacement: when they left home, when they became pregnant, when they were forced to leave their towns, and when they arrived in Bogotá. Results: Participants' life stories showed how they struggled with agency during their lives. They were victims of abuse and violence during childhood and finally decided to leave their homes. They decided to have their babies despite the fact that they were abandoned by their partners and families, and after doubts about and attempts to have an abortion. Throughout the process of displacement the participants had been engaged in ambiguous relationships with armed groups. Finally they arrived in Bogotá and faced adverse circumstances but were looking for better opportunities for them and their children. Conclusion: The analysis of how internally displaced women narrated their life stories showed us that the concepts that dominate scholarly debates about agency, victimization and survivorship do not do justice to the life stories of the participants in our study. These stories show that changes with a major impact were loaded with ambiguity and were characterized by helplessness, lack of control and agency simultaneously. The reconstruction of these life stories goes beyond the stereotype of displaced women as only 'victims', but points also to their agency and courageous decisions they made in contexts that were not controlled by them and where support was often lacking. Instead of label them, it is important to understand the complexity of the life experiences of IDW, in order to build policies that offer them aids as victims, but also build policies and intervention programs that empower them as agents in order to support them during resettlement.",Article,"Cadena-Camargo, Yazmin.; Krumeich, Anja.; Duque-Paramo, Maria Claudia.; Unknown",Agency;Colombia;Internally displaced women;Survivors;Victims,Agency;Colombia;Internally displaced women;Survivors;Victims,Netherlands;Colombia;Colombia,

How such reforms transformed employment-related insurance and entitlements, however, has received significantly less attention. This study aims to understand how the employment insurance system operates in Colombia and to assess how the experience of workers seeking social security entitlements relates to the system's structure. We conducted an ethnographic study of the Colombian Occupational Risk System between May 2014 and March 2016, with two main components: 1) analysis of the system itself through in-depth interviews with 32 people working in leadership positions and a systematic review of the system's most important legislation, and 2) a study of people who experienced problems receiving entitlements and were challenging the assessment of their work-related illness or accident. We conducted in-depth interviews with 22 people, followed up with half of them, and reviewed their case files. We found that difficulties accessing health care services, payments for medical leave, job reassignments, severance packages, and filing for pension benefits were common to all cases and resulted from overwhelming bureaucratic and administrative demands. Regional and national evaluation bodies dictate whether a given illness or accident is work-related, and establish a percentage of Loss of Wage Earning Capacity (LWEC). People's disabled bodies rarely reached the threshold of 50% LWEC to qualify for disability pensions. The lengthy process that workers were forced to endure to obtain work-related entitlements always involved the judiciary. The three competing for-profit financial sectors (health insurance, pension funds, and Occupational Risk Administrators) actively challenged workers' demands in order to increase their profits. We conclude that these for-profit sectors work contrary to the principles that sustain social security, Indeed, they push sick and disabled workers to unemployment, informality, economic dependence, and ultimately dire poverty.

Design/methodology/approach - For the empirical application, the authors use a unique primary data set drawn from the Global Competitiveness Project (GCP:) that includes information for 57 Colombian KIBS for 2019. The authors use a binary choice model to test the proposed hypotheses on the relevance of KIBS and process innovation in explaining export propensity. Findings - The results showed a positive relationship between KIBS and business size with an export propensity, but this relationship is non-meaningful. Also, the findings showed a negative and non-significant relationship between a process innovation and business age with the probability to export. On the other hand, the evidence state that KIBS firms encourage the relationship between propensity to export and process innovation, which is to say that they are highly effective to increase the propensity to export. Finally, the industry increases the probability of export propensity.

In Colombia, surnames are characters usually passed to the children by the father, and they have been compared to neutral alleles associated with the Y-chromosome. Objective. Population frequencies were determined for 17 short tandem repeats (STR) DNA markers on the Y-chromosome to compare the two identity codes and define the correlation between haplotypes and surnames in each individual. Materials and methods. DNA was extracted from blood samples from 308 male individuals in provinces of Valle del Cauca, Cauca and Narino, all in southwestern Colombia. Sample DNA was analyzed with the commercial kit AmpFLSTR (R) Yfiler (TM) (Applied Biosystems) and examined for the following 17 Y-chromosome STR markers: DYS19, DYS389I, DYS389II, DYS390, DYS391, DYS392, DYS393, DYS385a/b, DYS437, DYS438, DYS439, DYS448, DYS456, DYS458, DYS635 and Y-GATA-H4. The frequencies of molecular haplotypes were associated with the surname reported by each individual, and a correlation table was constructed. Amerindian and European surnames were associated with the presence of allele DYS19/13, a characteristic of Amerindian populations. Results. Allele frequencies were reported for each of the 17 STR markers in the southwestern region of Colombia-high genetic and haplotypic diversities were obtained. Approximately 40% of lineage inconsistencies were found when the molecular genotype was compared with the European or Amerindian surnames. Conclusions. Surnames must be used as population markers with reservation. The genetic evidence indicates that traditional genealogies based on surnames with or without documental support, may be inconsistant with their biological provenance.",Article,"Gomez, A.; Avila, S.J.; Briceno, I.","Genotype, names, Y chromosome; Indians, South American; Colombia","Genotype, names, Y chromosome;Indians, South American;Colombia;NORTHWESTERN ARGENTINA;ANTIOQUIA COLOMBIA;HUMAN-POPULATIONS;STR HAPLOTYPES;MICROSATELLITES;DISCRIMINATION;ANCESTRY;SAMPLES;CHOCO;LOCI",Colombia,2-s2.0-58149374100

We analysed which aspects influence health professionals ' decisions regarding end-of-life medical decisions and care for cancer patients. Methods Qualitative descriptive-exploratory study based on phenomenology using semi-structured interviews. We interviewed 28 oncologists, palliative care specialists, general practitioners and nurses from three major Colombian institutions, all involved in end-of-life care of cancer patients: Hospital Universitario San Ignacio and Instituto Nacional de Cancerologia in Bogota and Hospital Universitario San Jose in Popayan. Results When making decisions regarding end-of-life care, professionals consider: 1. Patient's clinical condition, cultural and social context, in particular treating indigenous patients requires special skills. 2. Professional skills and expertise: training in palliative care and experience in discussing end-of-life options and fear of legal consequences. Physicians indicate that many patients deny their imminent death which hampers shared decision-making and conversations. They mention frequent ambiguity regarding who initiates conversations regarding end-of-life decisions with patients and who finally takes decisions. Patients rarely initiate such conversations and the professionals normally do not ask patients directly for their preferences. Fear of confrontation with family members and lawsuits leads healthcare workers to carry out interventions such as initiating artificial feeding techniques and cardiopulmonary resuscitation, even in the absence of expected benefits. The opinions regarding the acceptability of palliative sedation, euthanasia and use of medications to accelerate death without the patients ' explicit request vary greatly. 3. Conditions of the insurance system: limitations exist in the offer of oncology and palliative care services for important proportions of the Colombian population. Colombians have access to opioid medications, barriers to their application are largely in delivery by the health system, the requirement of trained personnel for intravenous administration and ambulatory and home care plans which in Colombia are rare. Conclusions To improve end-of-life decision making, Colombian healthcare workers and patients need to openly discuss wishes, needs and care options and prepare caregivers. Promotion of palliative care education and development of palliative care centres and home care plans is necessary to facilitate access to end-of-life care. Patients and caregivers' perspectives are needed to complement physicians' perceptions and practices.",Article,"Luna-Meza, A.; Godoy-Casasbuenas, N.; Calvache, J.A.; Diaz-Amado, E.; Rueda, F.E.G.; Morales, O.; Leal, F.; Gomez-Restrepo, C.; de Vries, E.",Neoplasms; Terminal care; Palliative care; Death; Colombia,Neoplasms;Terminal care;Palliative care;Death;Colombia;SEDATION;AFRICA,Colombia;Netherlands,2-s2.0-85107048984

The Orinoco, or Llanos, region of eastern Colombia is predicted to increase expansion for palm oil acreage over the coming decades, with implications for biodiversity loss. Describing dietary diversity of frugivorous bats is a functional approach to understanding the effect of oil palm dominated landscapes on bat-fruit interactions. Our objective was to characterize the diet of the dominant (most abundant) bat species present in an oil palm landscape from the Colombian Llanos. We compared diet breadth of bat species on the basis of Levin’s index and we assessed differences in the frequency of seed consumption through Chi-square tests (χ2). We calculated diet overlap with a Morisita-Horn index. We characterized diet breadth and overlap for four taxa (three species and one species complex) of bats from 149 fecal samples and 344 individual bats, from which we identified 13 seed species. Dietary composition differed significantly among bat species, as did diet breadth. Diet breadth was highest in Carollia spp. and lowest in Sturnira lilium. The greatest degree of diet overlap ocurred between Artibeus lituratus and A. planirostris and the lowest overlap between S. lilium and all the other species. Considering the functional identity of the plants dispersed by bats in our sample, where most of them are pioneer species that colonize disturbed areas, it is fundamental to preserve habitats such as forest fragments that maintain bat assemblages with diverse diets in agriculturally disturbed landscapes. This may have important implications in future restoration process at these sites.",Article,"Cely-Gomez, Maria Alejandra.; Castillo-Figueroa, Dennis",Agricultural landscape;Chiroptera;Colombia;Ecosystem services;Oil palm;Orinoquia,Agricultural landscape;Chiroptera;Colombia;Ecosystem services;Oil palm;Orinoquia,Colombia,

Six hundred eighty seven insect species have been reported as bat ectoparasites, belonging to orders Dermaptera, Lepidoptera, Diptera and Siphonaptera (Marshall 1982). This study lists an inventory of bat ectoparasites found in fragments of Tropical Dry Forest on the Caribbean coast of Colombia. The study was conducted in the Department of Cordoba in four farms with fragments of Tropical Dry Forest. Bats were captured using mist nets and were collected and stored in plastic bags for subsequent examination in the laboratory. Ectoparasites were stored in alcohol and identified using a stereomicroscope and taxonomic keys. Two hundred fifty one bats belonging to 21 species were captured. The most abundant family was Phyllostomidae, followed by Emballonuridae, Noctilionidae, Vespertilionidae and Molossidae. Twelve genera of ectoparasites were found, belonging to families Streblidae, Nycteribiidae and Polyctenidae. Streblidae was the most abundant family and included the largest number of species. Thirty five percent of bats examined were hosts to at least one ectoparasite species. In this study, carried out in fragments of tropical dry forest in Cordoba, Colombia, we recorded dipterans in 17 out of 21 bat species. Hemypteran ectoparasites of the family Polyctenidae were found in Molossus molossus only. Eighty seven individual dipterans were found among 51 Carollia perspicillata specimens, which is consistent with the high parasitism levels previously reported.

Sixteen isoenzyme patterns were analyzed for five Colombian Lutzomyia species. The average unbiased expected heterozygosity levels ranged from 0.098 (Lu. youngi) to 0.215 (Lu. torvida). The five species samples, taken all the isoenzymes employed, were significantly deviated from the Hardy-Weinberg equilibrium by homozygous excess with classical as well as Markov chain exact tests. Possible causes: (1) Wahlund effect within populations due to subdivision and/or sampling. Endogamy could be discarded because these loci were affected by highly different levels of homozygous excess. (2) Null alleles could be not discarded, at least for some isoenzymes. The hierarchical Wright's F analysis showed high and significant values for each parameter. The average F-IT value was 0.655 with a conspicous homozygous excess at a global level (all species taken together); the average F-IS value was significantly positive (0.515) as well, with homozygous excess within each species. The genetic heterogeneity between the fives species was noteworthy (F-ST = 0.288), indicating clear genetic differentiation. The more related species pairs were Lu. longiflocosa-Lu. torvida (0.959) and Lu torvida-Lu. spinicrassa (0.960); while Lu. torvida-Lu. youngi (0.805) and Lu. quasitownsendi-Lu. youngi (0.796) were the most divergent (Nei's genetic identity matrix). UPGMA and Wagner algorithms showed that the most divergent species was Lit. youngi, whereas the most related were Lu. longiflocosa-Lu. torvida and Lu torvida-Lu. spinicrassa.

Informal irrigation in Colombia has not been investigated, its national presence has not been identified, and its characteristics are still unknown. The present article aims to help fill this gap. Because of topographical and agricultural patterns, Andean informal irrigation is impossible to identify or characterize using standard methods. To provide information on the scale of informal irrigation systems in Colombia, their type, the users they serve, and the type of water sources they use, a large-scale partial inventory was made combining statistical analysis, questionnaires, interviews, and field trips. The findings indicate that informal irrigation is widespread in the country's mountainous zones, in a great diversity of environments, characterized by an equally great diversity of local uses and water-use strategies. This diversity has resulted from the coexistence of very different community and state institutions, posing challenges for planning and organizing water-resource management more efficiently and sustainably for producers, the government, and other stakeholders.",Article,"Gutierrez-Malaxechebarria, A.M.",Informal irrigation; Colombia; household farming; production strategies; Andes,Informal irrigation;Colombia;household farming;production strategies;Andes;INDIGENOUS IRRIGATION;WATER;MANAGEMENT;SYSTEMS;AGRICULTURE;FARMERS;SECTOR,Colombia,2-s2.0-84883706364

Methods. Household-level information from mothers 18-49 years old and their children <5 years old was included. Stunting and overweight were assessed for each child. Mothers were classified according to their body mass index. Four anthropometric typologies at the household level were constructed: normal, underweight, overweight, and dual burden. Four three-level [households (n = 8598) nested within municipalities (n = 226), nested within states (n = 32)] hierarchical polytomous logistic models were developed. Household log-odds of belonging to one of the four anthropometric categories, holding 'normal' as the reference group, were obtained. Results. This study found that anthropometric typologies were associated with maternal and family characteristics of maternal age, parity, maternal education, and wealth index. Higher municipal living conditions index was associated with a lower likelihood of underweight typology and a higher likelihood of overweight typology. Higher population density was associated with a lower likelihood of overweight typology. Conclusion.

In this report, the Y-chromosome haplotype is determined and statistical analyses are performed to improve databases of Colombian Y-chromosome for comparison with relatives of the male line. Objective: Characterization of haplotypes through analysis of Y-chromosome STR molecular markers in a sample of Colombian Cundiboyacense highland population. Methods: From the «Program of blood Bank from officials at the Attorney General's Office (FGN)», 74 samples were randomly selected from individuals who reported no paternal relationship with each other and whose paternal geographic origin belonged at least for two generations to the departments of Cundinamarca and Boyacá. Seventeen (17) tandem repeat polymorphisms in the Y chromosome were amplified and typed (DYS456, DYS389I, DYS390, DYS389II, DYS458, DYS19, DYS385a/b, DYS393, DYS391, DYS439, DYS635, DYS392, Y-GATA-H4, DYS437, DYS438, and DYS448). Results: Distribution of allele and haplotype frequencies for the 17 markers were analyzed: 71 haplotypes were determined with 17 Y-STR markers of which 68 were unique and 3 were observed in two individuals, with a single shared haplotype for the two departments of the Cundiboyacense Plateau. The haplotype diversity for the sample population was 99.9% with a discrimination power of 95.9% and random match probability of 1.5%. The comparison of the two populations together had no significant differences, and therefore no regional specificity was found in allele frequencies between Cundinamarca and Boyacá. Discussion: The values of haplotype diversity, discrimination power, and probability of random coincidence showed the usefulness of Y-STR analysis in cases of patrilineal descent and are consistent with values observed in the early development of haplotype databases. Conclusion: The data analysis of the 17-Y STR markers obtained in this study provide haplotypes for the Cundiboyacense highlands, one of the most significant concentrations of population in Colombia, and serves as an informative database for forensic practice and genetic studies for human populations. © 2011 Universidad del Valle, Facultad de Salud.",Article,"Unknown.; Roa, Martha.; Balcazar, Ignacio Briceno.; Unknown.; Gomez, Alberto",Colombia;Haplotype;Haplotype diversity;STR-Y;Y-chromosome,Colombia;Haplotype;Haplotype diversity;STR-Y;Y-chromosome,Colombia;Colombia;Colombia,

Methods: Using Colombian national mortality statistics, we calculated age-standardized mortality rates (ASMR) as well as age-specific rates per 100,000 person-years, applying redistribution factors according to international recommendations. We imputed missing data for educational level. Multivariate Poisson regression models were constructed to incorporate age and educational level as independent variables. To assess changes in educational inequalities, we estimated the Relative Index of Inequality (RII). All estimates were also evaluated over time, resulting in estimated annual percent changes (EAPC). Results: Over time, cervical cancer mortality declined rapidly up to 2013 (EAPC = - 5.4%, ASMR 27.2 in 1998, 12.5 in 2013), after which ASMR stabilized. This pattern was present in all but the youngest age group and in all educational levels, but much stronger initial declines were observed among women with tertiary education (EAPC = - 8.3%) compared with those with primary (EAPC = - 4.0%) and secondary (EAPC = - 3.4%) educational levels. The overall RII was 6.77 (95%CI: 6.15, 7.47), varying from 3.5 for women aged 65 and over, to 8.5 in women aged 25-44.

This is particularly true in Colombia. There, the number of individuals with dementia may increase five-fold by 2050. Yet research is lacking on dementia in such settings. This work estimates the prevalence of dementia in a community-dwelling population in Colombia. It also assesses how gender-based differences in cardiovascular conditions and socioeconomic disparities affect dementia. This work analyzes data on 2000 respondents at least 60 years of age in the Health, Well-Being, And Aging (SABE) study in Bogota. Respondents with dementia are those who have cognitive impairment and at least two limitations in instrumental activities of daily living. The SABE study finds 8.4% of respondents have dementia. Age, cardiovascular risks, and socioeconomic disparities contributed to higher odds of dementia. The contributors to dementia can differ for men and women. For example, socioeconomic disparities were a larger contributor to dementia for women than men. The findings support the cognitive reserve hypothesis on dementia. This holds that pre-existing cognitive processes and compensatory mechanisms influence dementia. Women in Latin America are more likely to suffer from socioeconomic disparities that limit their cognitive reserve. This research points to several policy implications that can help offset these disparities and reduce the prevalence of dementia.",Article,"Mejia-Arango, S.; Garcia-Cifuentes, E.; Samper-Ternent, R.; Borda, M.G.; Cano-Gutierrez, C.A.",Colombia; Dementia; Gender-based; Gender disparity; Latin America; Socioeconomic disparity,Colombia;Dementia;Gender-based;Gender disparity;Latin America;Socioeconomic disparity;MONTREAL COGNITIVE ASSESSMENT;ALZHEIMERS-DISEASE;INSTRUMENTAL ACTIVITIES;CARDIOVASCULAR HEALTH;SEX-DIFFERENCES;SCREENING TOOL;LATIN-AMERICA;AIR-POLLUTION;PREVALENCE;ASSOCIATION,Mexico;Colombia;United States;Norway,2-s2.0-85096864139

Upon arrival at a psychiatric clinic in Bogota, 76 patients were evaluated by a group of mental health professionals with experience in this diagnosis. Contrary to clinicians' expectations, there was a conspicuous lack of PTSD among this population. Subsequently, the clinical team administered the Clinician Administered PTSD Scale with 21 of these patients; PTSD was found in 57% of the men. The authors consider various arguments that might explain this discrepancy. Differences between the clinical presentation of PTSD among the ex-combatants and the classic descriptions contained in the DSM-IV-TR may be explained by organisational characteristics of the irregular armed groups.

To assess this, the abundance of nine species of juvenile corals was correlated with eight macro-habitat (location of the reef on shelf, depth) and micro-habitat (type and inclination of the substrate, exposure to light, texture and amount of sediment accumulated on bottom, potential growth area for juveniles) conditions. Sampling was conducted in four insular coral reefs in the Colombian Caribbean: two oceanic and two continental reefs (influenced by large rivers), covering a total of 600m(2) and the distribution of corals on a vertical gradient. Contingency tables and coefficients (magnitude) and multiple correspondence analyses were used to evaluate the dependency ratios for each species. The results showed that Agaricia tenuifolia displayed the most robust pattern of dependence (two high and two moderate), significant for juveniles present at a high frequency in continental reefs, devoid of potential area for juvenile growth (surrounded by macroalgae), and covering horizontal substrates exposed to light. The juveniles were associated with a habitat of moderate to high bottom accumulation of extremely fine sediment. Ponies astreoides presented four moderate dependencies; ocean reefs between 2-16m depths, a high frequency of juveniles on horizontal substrates, exposed to light, non-sedimented and occupied by competitors. Siderastrea siderea displayed three moderate dependences for juveniles in cryptic zones, inclined substrate and devoid of competitors. A. lamarcki, Leptoseris cucullata and A. agaricites presented two moderate dependences; these species share high abundance of juveniles in habitats with no sediment, exposed to light and occupied by competitors (except A. agaricites). The P ponies, Favia fragum and Montastraea cavernosa species had a moderate dependence with high incidence of juveniles in ocean reefs and microhabitats exposed to light. For the nine species, results indicate that the presence (colonization), abundance and survival of juveniles, depend on certain species-specific particularities of the habitat. However, the juveniles show high tolerance and plasticity to a range of habitat variables, given their independence and low dependence observed in over 50% of the variables assessed. Rev. Biol.

Both methods rapidly produce a vegetation cover that helps to stabilize soils, but the value of resulting ecosystems for wildlife needs to be evaluated. We assessed the effects of these two restoration methods on the diversity and abundance of bess beetles (Passalidae), which are important deadwood recyclers. We quantified coarse woody debris (logs and branches >10 cm diameter) and associated passalid beetle fauna in 40-year-old Andean alder (Alnus acuminata) plantations, adjacent natural regeneration and old-forest remnants, at 2430 m of elevation in the Central Andes. The three forest types contained the same number of logs per unit area, but wood volume was lower in alder stands than in natural forest types. Old-forest remnants contained a higher number of occupied logs and individual beetles per transect and per unit wood volume than the two other habitats. We found six species of beetle, three of which were found in the three habitats and the other three in one habitat each. Forest remnants and natural regeneration had four species each, whereas alder plantations had three species.

The Amazon Vision programme, launched by the Colombian government in 2016, seeks to contribute to forest conservation, climate mitigation, poverty reduction and peace building. The Amazon Vision fundamentally reframes the Colombian Amazon from a 'narco frontier' that needs to be liberated from guerrilla influence, organized crime and peasants destroying forests for coca cultivation, to a net CO2 sink with enormous potential for green growth and poverty reduction. Drawing on historical and empirical qualitative research in Guaviare and complemented by a quantitative land cover classification, this article builds on the concept of green territoriality' to investigate the extent to which the shift towards conservation affects property rights and the ability of indigenous groups and peasants to access land and natural resources. We illustrate how the reframing of peasants from protagonists of development and frontier expansion to villains, and of indigenous communities from 'underdeveloped' forest dwellers to environmental guardians, has created land conflicts and affected the legitimacy of their respective property rights.

This industrial activity, however, generates several by-products that can threaten environmental sustainability. Seawage, for example, can contain organic pollutants and heavy metals; therefore, its deposition must be preceded by adequate water treatment. In this study, we isolated, characterized, and molecularly identified eight bacteria on the basis of their capability to degrade phenol. First, we determined the rates of bacterial growth and phenol degradation using different concentrations of the aromatic hydrocarbon (500, 800 and 1200 mg / L), and then used sequential statistical designs to select optimal conditions for its degradation. Results showed that all isolated strains were capable of degrading phenol as the sole carbon source; the degradation kinetics and phenol tolerance, however, widely varied among strains. We chose the strain Pseudomonas sp. Sps1 for further studies due to its remarkable tolerance and capability to degrade phenol. By using a Plackett Burman design, followed by a fractionated factorial design in which several carbon, nitrogen, and phosphorus sources were evaluated, and phenol degradation was used as the response variable, we found optimal conditions for phenol degradation by Sps1. Finally, we compared phenol degradation in seawage by the use or not of the optimal conditions established by the statistical methods. Results showed that biostimulation dramatically increased phenol degradation compared with the control. In conclusion, we found that bioaugmentation with the native bacteria Sps1 and a statistically-based biostimulation approach provided an economically and environmentally friendly alternative for the removal of pollutants from oil industry sewage.",Article,"Pardo-Diaz, S.; Rojas-Tapias, D.; Roldan, F.; Brandao, P.; Almansa-Manrique, E.",oil extraction; hydrocarbon; native bacteria; nutrients; Colombia,oil extraction;hydrocarbon;native bacteria;nutrients;Colombia;RESPONSE-SURFACE METHODOLOGY;STATISTICAL OPTIMIZATION;PSEUDOMONAS-PUTIDA;ACTIVATED-SLUDGE;DEGRADATION;HYDROCARBONS;STRAIN;BACTERIUM;SELECTION;TOXICITY,Colombia,

However, Patino-Camargo performed other investigations from 1917-1943, which represent the first descriptions and scientific evidence of the presence of R. prowazekii and R. typhi in Colombia. Almost 60 years after the latest research conducted by Dr. Patino-Camargo, rickettsioses were again a matter of interest and research.

More studies are needed on risk factors, specifically in developing countries. This study explored the association of several factors and AR among urban residents in six cities of Colombia. Methodology:A cross-sectional study and a nested case-control study were carried out between 2009 and 2010 involving two Colombian subpopulations: children/adolescents and adults. Cases were affirmative respondents to ""In the past 12 months, have you (or your child) had a problem with sneezing or a running or blocked nose, when you (or your child) did not have a cold or the flur""""Controls""were subjects who never had been diagnosed with asthma, AR or atopic eczema by a physician, and whom did not report any symptoms in the past twelve months. Weighted logistic regression was used to assess the association of different factors with case/control status. Results:Factors associated with AR in children/adolescents were family history of AR, acetaminophen consumption and high socioeconomic status. Among adults, family history of asthma, AR and atopic eczema, and cetaminophen consumption were associated with AR. Consumption of cereals among children/adolescents and eating eggs among adults showed protective associations.

Breast reconstruction, either immediate or delayed, is part of the treatment of breast cancer. Each country and health system pays for and evaluates these procedures in different ways. Thus, it is important to determine which strategy is most cost-effective in Colombia. Objective: To evaluate the cost-utility of breast cancer treatment with immediate reconstruction compared with delayed reconstruction. Materials and methods: We used a decision tree model and a one-year time horizon from the perspective of the third-party payer; the cost data were taken from the Colombian Instituto de Seguros Sociales 2001 rate manual plus a 30% adjustment according to the methodology of the Instituto de Evaluacion Tecnologica en Salud, IETS, and the billing model of the Centro Javeriano de Oncologia at the Hospital Universitario San Ignacio. The transition probabilities and profits were obtained from medical specialists, patients, and the medical literature. We also conducted univariate and probabilistic sensitivity analyses. Results: The expected costs per capita were COP$ 26,710,605 (USD$ 11,165) for the immediate reconstruction and COP$ 26,459,557 (USD$ 11,060) for the deferred reconstruction. Immediate reconstruction generated an incremental cost of COP$ 251,049 (USD$ 105) and 0.75 quality-adjusted life years (QALY), while deferred reconstruction generated 0.63 QALYs, with an incremental cost-utility ratio of COP$ 2,154,675 per QALY (USD$ 901). Conclusions: The cost per QALY did not exceed the acceptability threshold of the Gross Domestic Product (GDP) per capita. The costs for the first year were similar. Both techniques are favorable for the Colombian health system, but the utility reported by patients and the literature is greater with the immediate reconstruction.",Article,"Perea, A.H.; Rosselli, D.",Breast neoplasms; mastectomy; modified radical; mammoplasty; cost-benefit analysis; quality of life; Colombia,Breast neoplasms;mastectomy;modified radical;mammoplasty;cost-benefit analysis;quality of life;Colombia;QUALITY-OF-LIFE;COST-EFFECTIVENESS ANALYSIS;EPIGASTRIC PERFORATOR FLAP;PEDICLED TRAM FLAP;HEALTH-CARE COSTS;FEBRILE NEUTROPENIA;SPARING MASTECTOMY;POSTMASTECTOMY RECONSTRUCTION;PSYCHOSOCIAL OUTCOMES;CONSERVING SURGERY,Colombia,2-s2.0-85054698805

Methodology Analytical cohort study of patients with cancer and COVID-19 infection in Colombia. From April 1 to October 31, 2020. Demographic and clinical variables related to cancer and COVID-19 infection were collected. The primary outcome was 30-day mortality from all causes. The association between the outcome and the prognostic variables was analyzed using logistic regression models and survival analysis with Cox regression. Results The study included 742 patients; 72% were >51 years. The most prevalent neoplasms were breast (132, 17.77%), colorectal (92, 12.34%), and prostate (81, 10.9%). Two hundred twenty (29.6%) patients were asymptomatic and 96 (26.3%) died. In the bivariate descriptive analysis, higher mortality occurred in patients who were >70 years, patients with lung cancer, >= 2 comorbidities, former smokers, receiving antibiotics, corticosteroids, and anticoagulants, residents of rural areas, low socioeconomic status, and increased acute-phase reactants. In the logistic regression analysis, higher mortality was associated with Eastern Cooperative Oncology Group performance status (ECOG PS) 3 (odds ratio [OR] 28.67; 95% confidence interval [CI], 8.2-99.6); ECOG PS 4 (OR 20.89; 95% CI, 3.36-129.7); two complications from COVID-19 (OR 5.3; 95% CI, 1.50-18.1); and cancer in progression (OR 2.08; 95% CI, 1.01-4.27). In the Cox regression analysis, the statistically significant hazard ratios (HR) were metastatic disease (HR 1.58; 95% CI, 1.16-2.16), cancer in progression (HR 1.08; 95% CI, 1.24-2.61) cancer in partial response (HR 0.31; 95% CI, 0.11-0.88), use of steroids (HR 1.44; 95% CI, 1.01-2.06), and use of antibiotics (HR 2.11; 95% CI, 1.47-2.95). Conclusion In our study, patients with cancer have higher mortality due to COVID-19 infection if they have active cancer, metastatic or progressive cancer, ECOG PS >2, and low socioeconomic status. Implications for Practice This study's findings raise the need to carefully evaluate patients with metastatic cancer, in progression, and with impaired Eastern Cooperative Oncology Group status to define the relevance of cancer treatment during the pandemic, consider the risk/benefit of the interventions, and establish clear and complete communication with the patients and their families about the risk of complications.

A sociocultural approach to the practices of risky riding among male motorcyclists in Valledupar, Colombia","Background: More than 1.25 million people die worldwide every year because of Road Traffic Injuries (RTIs), a fact that has turned RTIs into a priority on the international public health agenda. In Colombia, road traffic fatal injuries are the second cause of violent deaths, with motorcycle riders being the most vulnerable actors on the roads. In Valledupar, Colombia, the city where this study was conducted, the number of fatal and non-fatal RTIs is higher than the national average. The study used social representations theory to explore the connections amongst the construction of masculine subjectivities, the experiences of RTIs by male motorcyclists in Valledupar as well as the role of gender relations and the life cycle in this problem. This study was conducted with the goal of informing public policy on traffic safety and contributing to the design of prevention programs. Methods: This study used qualitative methods and biographical-narrative techniques. Semi-structured and in-depth interviews were conducted with 11 male motorcyclists in Valledupar. The results of the identification of social representations were validated with two focus groups. Results: Findings suggest that the risky riding practices of motorcyclists who have suffered RTIs, such as violation of transit regulations, frequent drinking, speeding, and an attitude that legitimizes the lack of care for themselves and for others are associated with culturally legitimized socialization patterns in the configuration of masculine subjectivities in the territory. Conclusions: These findings help explain the high number of men with RTIs and guide decision making regarding road safety public policies, with particular emphasis on suburban cities in countries with medium-level incomes. We suggest the adoption of diverse and complementary strategies that add a cultural perspective in the long term, in combination with the gender-based and differential approaches in the transformation of dangerous riding.",Article,"Torres-Quintero, A.; Palacios-Doncel, D.L.; Dominguez-Torres, M.T.; Gafaro-Barrera, M.E.; Burbano-Valente, J.",Masculinity; Motorcycles; Road traffic injuries; Qualitative research; Colombia,Masculinity;Motorcycles;Road traffic injuries;Qualitative research;Colombia;HEGEMONIC MASCULINITY;ROAD SAFETY;INJURIES;INTERVENTIONS;RETHINKING;GENDER,Colombia,2-s2.0-85069720746

Usher syndrome is a disorder characterized by progressive retinitis pigmentosa, prelingual sensory hearing loss and vestibular dysfunction. It is the most frequent cause of deaf-blindness in humans. Three clinical types and twelve genetic subtypes have been characterized. Type II is the most common, and among these cases, nearly 80% have mutations in the USH2A gene. Objective. The aim of the study was to establish the mutational frequencies for the short isoform of USH2A gene in Usher syndrome type II. Materials and methods. Twenty-six Colombian individuals with Usher syndrome type II were included. SSCP analysis for 20 exons of the short isoform was performed and abnormal patterns were sequenced. Sequencing of exon 13 of the USH2A gene was performed for all the individuals because the most frequent mutation is located in this exon. Results. The most frequent mutation was c.2299delG, identified in the 27% (n=8) of the sample. The second mutation, p.R334W, showed a frequency of 15%. A new variant identified in the 5'UTR region, g.129G>T, was present in 1 individual (4%). Four polymorphisms were identified; one of them is a new deletion in exon 20, first reported in this study.

We fill this gap by analysing newspaper reading in Colombia, where this form of cultural participation is particularly important and potentially enables significant crossovers at societal level. We apply an economic model with rational addiction to national micro data from the “Survey on Cultural Consumption 2012”. In a country where the habit of reading on paper still resists a relative diffusion of the Internet, we show the persistence of a certain participation gap even if with some distinctive features with respect to general cultural participation. The average profile of a Colombian newspaper reader corresponds to a middle-high educated white/mixed male in his working age, married/cohabiting and living in metropolitan areas. Regressions results show that both the likelihood and the intensity of reading newspapers are positively influenced by higher levels of education and having a habit of reading in general, a higher age, being a male and resident in major cities. From a policy perspective, our findings point to possible socio-economic leverages in order to lower such a participation gap, and hence contribute to foster more egalitarian conditions among the population.",Article,"Aguado, Luis F.; Lazzaro, Elisabetta.; Unknown.; Unknown",Colombia;Cultural participation;Newspaper readings;Participation gap,Colombia;Cultural participation;Newspaper readings;Participation gap,Netherlands;Colombia;Spain,

Secondary sources were consulted, taken from the Consolidated Registry of Displaced Population and from the National Administrative Department of Statistics, to calculate expulsion and reception rates for population displaced by violence from 2002 to 2010. Based on these rates, four groups were created of municipalities in the extreme quartile for each rate during the entire period, which were classified as high expulsion, low expulsion, high reception, and low reception. Subsequently, population pyramids and structure indicators were constructed for each group of municipalities for two comparative reference years (1985 and 2010). Results. Municipalities with high expulsion or reception rates experienced a slower epidemiological transition, with lower mean ages and aging indices. The high expulsion group had the least regression, based on the Sundbarg index. In the high reception group, the masculinity ratio decreased the most, especially among the economically active population, and it had the highest population growth. Conclusions.

Recent studies on antiviral immunity have created an atmosphere of optismism about the possibility of achieving a safe and effective antiviral vaccine in the near future. In this context, during the course of the Seminar/Workshop: “Intersectoral integration in health research” organized by CIDEIM, one of the objectives was to identify research needs to facilitate the introduction of respiratory syncytial virus vaccines in Colombia and particularly to estimate the disease burden by this agent in the country. In this context, the present work revised the information reported by epidemiologial and clinical studies on respiratory syncytial virus conducted in the country within the past 40 years to describe the disease prevalence and the temporal distribution of this respiratory pathogen in different cities of Colombia. Although in several cities there is a peak in the presentation of the virus between March and April, especially in Bogotá, the city with the greatest number of studies, this does not seem to be the case in other cities, for example, Cali. Despite the fact that there is heterogeneity in the prevalence of infection by respiratory sincitial virus (range: 7% - 41%) depending on the type of study, for the last 40 years the virus has been the main agent responsible for lower respiratory tract infections in children under 5 years in Colombia.",Article,"Unknown.; Parra, Beatriz.; Unknown.; Unknown.; Unknown.; Unknown",Children;Colombia;Periodicity;Prevalence;Respiratory infections;Respiratory Syncytial Virus,Children;Colombia;Periodicity;Prevalence;Respiratory infections;Respiratory Syncytial Virus,Colombia;Colombia;Colombia;Colombia;Colombia;Colombia,

Data on the epidemiology of this disease in Latin America are scarce. In Colombia, the Ministry of Health introduced SISPRO, a tool to collect nation-wide information from the health system. The information collected from SISPRO is available for scientific analysis. Using SISPRO data for the years 2012-2016, an analysis was made on the prevalence and characteristics of patients diagnosed with PMR. This is a descriptive epidemiological study using the International Statistical Classification of Diseases and Related Health Problems as search terms related to PMR, based on SISPRO data. Criteria for diagnosis are not explicitly addressed in each individual case. National records report 19,901 individuals diagnosed with PMR and estimated prevalence of 2 cases per 1000 inhabitants over 50 years old (based on a total population of 47,663,162), being more frequent in women (86% of cases), with a female/male ratio of 6.2:1.

Adults (N = 395) aged 18-68 and living in Bogota were presented with 24 vignettes that were composed according to two within-subject orthogonal factor designs: (a) Demand for drugs in the country x Current government policy regarding soft and hard drugs (from ""laissez faire"" policy for all drugs to complete prohibition of all drugs) and (b) Information campaigns regarding the dangerousness of drugs x Current policy. Participants rated the level of acceptability of each policy. Seven different perspectives were identified that can be grouped into five broad views. The first one (50 % of participants) was called ""radical constructionists"" because participants considered that all policies were unacceptable. The second one (19 %) was called ""cultural conservatives"" because only one drug policy was considered fully acceptable: complete prohibition (although half of the members of this group were willing to allow soft drugs to be sold freely). The third one (14 %) was called ""progressive prohibitionists"" because the preferred policies in this group were either complete prohibition or complete regulation by the government. The fourth one (8 %) was called ""free trade libertarians"" because the dominant opinion was that the drug market should be free.

In Colombia during 2014.2018, an analytical study was conducted in 13 243 Colombian children between the ages of 5 and 17 years, based on cross-sectional data compiled by ENSIN-2015 (Encuesta Nacional de la Situacion Nutricional en Colombia-2015) on serum ferritin levels and dietary consumption based on a questionnaire of the frequency of consumption. Using simple and multiple linear regression, with the serum ferritin level as the dependent variable and the frequency of consumption as the main explanatory variable, the crude and adjusted partial regression coefficients (β) between serum ferritin levels and consumption were calculated. The frequency of habitual consumption of red meat was 0.49 (95 % CI 0.47, 0.51) times/d. The frequency of habitual egg consumption was 0.76 (95 % CI 0.74, 0.78) times per d.

I will argue that this shift to multiculturalism has not meant the disappearance of the talks and disputes of racism and the beginning of a kind of post-racial' social formation.

Group transfers usually occur when individuals disperse to obtain re-productive positions. Between 1995 and 2000 we studied the social system of Sharpe's Wren (Cinnycerthia olivascens) in an Andean forest. Wrens lived all the time in groups of up to seven individuals that maintained year-round, all-purpose territo-ries (mean = 7.6 ha) and raised offspring cooperatively. Each group had only one breeding pair, and produced 1-3 fledglings. Group composition was highly variable. Birds of all age classes frequently joined and abandoned groups. Birds became helpers when joining new groups. In one case a female breeding vacancy was filled by a bird that had joined the group two and a half years earlier. Four focal groups each had up to 20 different, temporary members in three years of ob-servation, and only the breeding pair was permanent. Seven of eight breeding females and one male (of 35 banded adults) had frontal patches and periocular rings of white feathers, suggesting that this characteristic is related to breeding status (but not necessarily age). Groups maintained three or more roosting nests simultaneously and built new nests continuously. Flea infestations may have been a cause of nest abandonment. Fluidity in group membership suggests that benefits of sociality in this species are not related to indirect fitness, nor to direct benefits that hinge on life-long associations between individuals. Instead, group-living may be related to the need to constantly build new, massive nest structures.",Article,"Kattan, Gustavo H.; Unknown.; Unknown",Andes;Colombia;Cooperative breeding;Helping behavior;Social behavior;Troglodytidae,Andes;Colombia;Cooperative breeding;Helping behavior;Social behavior;Troglodytidae,Colombia;Puerto Rico;Colombia,

To describe the current state of the population aged 60 years and older in Colombia and to determine the Active Aging Index (AAI) and assess its domains. Methods. Based on data collected during the national survey of health, well-being, and aging conducted in Colombia in 2015 (known as SABE Colombia 2015), the AAI for Colombia was calculated using the methodology applied in the countries of the European Union, with the same four domains. The methodology was adapted to the data provided by the survey and to the Colombian context. Results. The AAI for Colombia was 37.4. Older adults in Colombia had a high level of employability, but the largest percentage of jobs was in the informal sector. A small percentage of older adults were active in political groups, associations, or organizations advocating for decisions that will benefit society and the country. The fact that a large majority of older adults in Colombia are able to function adequately presents opportunities to improve their performance in line with the determinants of active aging. Conclusions. This study is the first real attempt to characterize the state of older adults in Colombia and their possibilities to achieve active aging. Public policies should be adjusted to close the identified gaps and improve the quality of life for older adults by offering opportunities for them to earn adequate pay for a better quality of life.

This industrial activity, however, generates several by-products that can threaten environmental sustainability. Seawage, for example, can contain organic pollutants and heavy metals; therefore, its deposition must be preceded by adequate water treatment. In this study, we isolated, characterized, and molecularly identified eight bacteria on the basis of their capability to degrade phenol. First, we determined the rates of bacterial growth and phenol degradation using different concentrations of the aromatic hydrocarbon (500, 800 and 1200 mg / L), and then used sequential statistical designs to select optimal conditions for its degradation. Results showed that all isolated strains were capable of degrading phenol as the sole carbon source; the degradation kinetics and phenol tolerance, however, widely varied among strains. We chose the strain Pseudomonas sp. Sps1 for further studies due to its remarkable tolerance and capability to degrade phenol. By using a Plackett Burman design, followed by a fractionated factorial design in which several carbon, nitrogen, and phosphorus sources were evaluated, and phenol degradation was used as the response variable, we found optimal conditions for phenol degradation by Sps1. Finally, we compared phenol degradation in seawage by the use or not of the optimal conditions established by the statistical methods. Results showed that biostimulation dramatically increased phenol degradation compared with the control. In conclusion, we found that bioaugmentation with the native bacteria Sps1 and a statistically-based biostimulation approach provided an economically and environmentally friendly alternative for the removal of pollutants from oil industry sewage.",Article,"Unknown.; Rojas-Tapias, Daniel.; Roldan, Fabio.; Unknown.; Unknown",Colombia;Hydrocarbon;Native bacteria;Nutrients;Oil extraction,Colombia;Hydrocarbon;Native bacteria;Nutrients;Oil extraction,Colombia;Colombia;Colombia,

A decline in resource availability and new proposals was observed at the national level with a shift to COVID-19 related research. However, at institutional level there was no decline in the number of cancer research proposals. The predominance of observational studies as opposed to the preponderance of clinical trials and basic science in high-income countries may be related to the lower impact at institutional level. Nevertheless, we found difficulties similar to previous reports for conducting research during the pandemic. PIs reported long recovery times and a great impact on research other than clinical trials, such as observational and qualitative studies. No significant impact on research output was observed.

Within the genus Cliona, some species share the common traits of being brown to olive-green in color, and harboring photosynthetic, unicellular dinoflagellates (zooxanthellae). These Cliona spp. have been grouped as the Cliona viridis species complex. Several species of this complex completely encrust the excavated substratum with a thin veneer of tissue and, when colonizing dead exposed parts of live coral colonies, they are able to undermine or overgrow and thus kill live coral tissue as they advance predominantly laterally. In the course of our taxonomic and ecological studies of Caribbean brown to brown-black encrusting Cliona, we found an as yet undescribed species that stands out by having tylostyle megasclere spicules with narrow heads and lacking the usual microsclere spicule complement of spirasters.

Colonization by this fungus in patients with chronic obstructive pulmonary disease (COPD) could be associated with higher rates of exacerbations and impaired lung function in these patients. Our objective was to determine whether colonization by P. jirouecii in patients with COPD is associated with increased exacerbations and deterioration of lung function. This was a prospective cohort study on patients with COPD. All participants meeting selection criteria underwent clinical and microbiological assessments and were then classified as colonized vs. non-colonized patients. Chi-squared tests were performed and multivariate logistic models were fitted in order to obtain risk ratios (RR) with 95% confidence intervals (CI). We documented a frequency of colonization by P. jirouecii of 32.3%. Most patients were categorized as having GOLD B and D COPD.

One hundred and six patients with anti-neutrophil cytoplasmic antibody-associated vasculitis were included in the study. The average age was 55 years, and 57.5% were women. In 68.8% of the cases, the diagnosis was made during hospitalization, with an average hospital stay of 16.6 days (+/- 12.22). The distribution by type of vasculitis was: granulomatosis with polyangiitis 52%, microscopic polyangiitis 45.2% and eosinophilic granulomatosis with polyangiitis 1.8%. Alveolar hemorrhage occurred in 35% of patients; 20.7% had variable renal involvement, of which 53.8% progressed to advanced kidney disease. Treatment included glucocorticoids 91.5%, cyclophosphamide 62.2%, plasmapheresis 14.1%, and 41.5% required renal replacement therapy. In-hospital mortality was 16.5%, Sepsis was the most common cause of death. We present clinical information on a group of patients with anti-neutrophil cytoplasmic antibody-associated vasculitis; renal involvement was the the most common type of affectation. Both the clinical and serological characteristics of our registry were similar to those described in other Latin American and European cohorts, and a lower in-hospital mortality rate was evidenced.",Article,"Fernandez-Avila, D.G.; Rondon-Carvajal, J.; Villota-Eraso, C.; Gutierrez-Davila, J.M.; Contreras-Villamizar, K.M.",Anti-neutrophil cytoplasmic antibody-associated vasculitis; Glomerulonephritis; Alveolar hemorrhage; Epidemiology; Colombia,Anti-neutrophil cytoplasmic antibody-associated vasculitis;Glomerulonephritis;Alveolar hemorrhage;Epidemiology;Colombia;SCORE,Colombia,2-s2.0-85086775168

In this paper, we study how the demography and epidemic profile of a community are altered when they transition from living in nomadic conditions in a forested environment to a peri-urban settlement in a city of the Amazon basin. We analyse demographic and epidemic data with a multilevel model to understand individual and community-level effects in terms of the risk of malarial infection. We show that malaria becomes endemic when the population settles in the peri-urban area of the city. We also show that the reproductive rate of women in the group increases as they become sedentary, and that while individual fertility rates have no effect on risk of contracting malaria, population-level fertility rates are associated with malaria endemicity.",Article,"Feged-Rivadeneira, A.; Del Cairo, C.; Vargas, W.",Amazon; Colombia; demography; malaria; migration; peri-urban; public health,Amazon;Colombia;demography;malaria;migration;peri-urban;public health;CENTRAL-AFRICA;POPULATION BIOLOGY;OUT-MIGRATION;URBAN MALARIA;LAND-USE;URBANIZATION;DEFORESTATION;TRANSMISSION;BRAZZAVILLE;FERTILITY,Colombia,

The benign chorea hereditary (BCH, OMIM 118700) represents a childhood movement disorder characterized by its early onset, a slow progressive course (mostly stable) and the absence of mental compromise, which contrast with the clinical features exhibited by the Huntington Disease. Case reports. Here we describe a multigenerational, extended and inbreed family belonging to a genetic isolate, the Paisa community from Antioquia Colombia, with seven children exhibiting clinical features of BCH. Even though some patients with BCH are heterozygous for a dominant mutation in the thyroid transcription factor-1 gene (TITFl), the pattern in this family resembles a recessive mode of inheritance, which suggests that genetic heterogeneity may be playing a role.

Many natural ecosystems, especially wetlands, have been modified or destroyed due to conversion to rice fields. However, rice crops require flooding, and the wetlands thus created can provide food for several organisms including shorebirds. In the organic rice fields of Valle del Cauca, in Colombia, twelve species of Nearctic migrant shorebirds have been recorded, including the highest numbers of Least Sandpipers (Calidris minutilla) in Colombia. On their breeding grounds in North America, Least Sandpipers feed on benthic and terrestrial invertebrates, while on the wintering grounds they ingest a wider range of prey. To determine the diet of Least Sandpipers in this type of cultivation in Valle del Cauca, from October 2012 to December 2012 we caught 50 individuals using mist netting and obtained regurgitates induced with saline solution. The identification of prey found in regurgitates indicates that Least Sandpipers feed on insects, spiders, and vegetable material in the study site. In addition, they use small stones to crush prey with hard exoskeleton, such as Coleoptera and Hemiptera. Given the relatively high levels of consumption of beetle larvae and adults, which are considered pests for rice crops, Least Sandpipers could be one of the main bio-control agents of these insects. This information contributes to understand why Least Sandpipers use organic rice fields and highlights the importance of this agroecosystem for the migration of this shorebird.",Article,"Cifuentes-Sarmiento, Y.; Renjifo, L.M.",Agroecosystem; Colombia; Diet; Regurgitation; Ricefield; Shorebirds,Agroecosystem;Colombia;Diet;Regurgitation;Ricefield;Shorebirds;MIGRANT SHOREBIRDS;SPRING MIGRATION;FORAGING ECOLOGY;FEEDING ECOLOGY;FOOD-HABITS;WATERBIRDS;DYNAMICS;PATTERNS;CAMARGUE;WETLANDS,Colombia,2-s2.0-84992220816

This habitat specialization makes it vulnerable, reason why it is important to document population densities and their spatial and temporal variations, to understand responses to habitat alterations. The distribution and abundance of the torrent duck in the Quindío River and several small tributaries in the Department of Quindío, Colombia was evaluated in this work. Monthly counts of ducks during eight months (June 2011 to January 2012) were made along 8.5 km of the river. The species is distributed all along the Quindio river bed between 1,415 masl. as far as the junction of the Cárdenas and San José streams at 2,264 masl. and seven of its tributaries. The highest elevation record was at 3,325 masl. Monthly ducks density was negatively correlated with precipitation and varied between 4.1 and 6.8 individuals per km during months of low precipitation, versus less than one bird per km in the rainy months. This drop in density occurs because, when the river is fast-flowing, ducks probably move to other areas, among them to the smaller tributaries in the highest parts of the river. Densities in the Quindío River are high compared to those reported in studies for other places in Colombia, Peru and Argentina. It is necessary to carry out more studies which allow establishing duck movements in relation to the river's flow rate as well as the impact of the flow on the abundance of resources (aquatic insects) and breeding seasons.",Article,"Ramirez-U.; Laura M.; Unknown.; Kattan, Gustavo H.",Altitudinal distribution;Colombia;Habitat specialization;Population density;Torrent duck,Altitudinal distribution;Colombia;Habitat specialization;Population density;Torrent duck,Colombia;Colombia,

This fungus is the main pathogen detected around the world. However, research has shown the presence of another fungus, Saprolegnia ferax, as a cause of mortality in amphibians in North America. Our study suggests a possible interspecific transmission caused by the presence of rainbow trout; thus, amphibian declines may not be attributable only to the presence of a single pathogen, but to other organisms and factors. Materials and methods: Our study revealed the presence of Saprolegnia sp. in the Andean frog Atelopus mittermeieri using the imprinting technique with lactophenol blue staining, which allowed the typical structures of this fungus to be observed. Results: The importance of this discovery is the presence of two pathogenic fungi, B. dendrobatidis and Saprolegnia, which affecting simultaneously a population of amphibians. This finding brings attention to the eventual presence of other microorganisms that might be involved individually or collectively in the decline of amphibian species.

In Colombia, congenital malformations are the second leading cause of infant mortality. Objective: To determine the geographical distribution of extended perinatal mortality due to congenital malformations in Colombia between 1999 and 2008. Materials and methods: We conducted a cross-sectional study. We revised all death certificates issued between 1999 and 2008. We defined perinatal mortality as fetal or non-fetal deaths within the first 28 days after delivery in children with body weight >= 500 grams, and congenital malformations according to ICD-10 diagnostic codes Q000 - Q999. The annual birth projection was used as the denominator. We defined high mortality areas due to congenital malformations as those in the 90th percentile. Results: We recorded 22,361 perinatal deaths due to congenital malformations.

The theory had, on the one hand, an institutional component with an emphasis on power-sharing institutions and, on the other, a cultural component stressing the importance of a spirit of accommodation. Initially, the theory was based on case studies of countries like Austria, Belgium, the Netherlands and Switzerland, which allowed dealing with both institutional and cultural aspects. Later on, when the theory was tested with a large sample of countries, the cultural aspect was increasingly neglected, because it was difficult to empirically operationalize.

It also shows there is a low knowledge about osteoporosis and its relation to fractures, in addition to the very poor adherence to medical advice and treatment. Introduction Osteoporosis is a systemic skeletal disease associated with an increased risk of fragility fractures and is a public health problem worldwide due to population aging. Early osteoporosis diagnosis and treatment is very important for reducing the incidence of fragility fractures and the resulting complications. Our study describes the clinical characteristics of patients with fragility fractures and their risk factors, evaluates the level of knowledge that patients have about osteoporosis, and follows-up on each case to establish if, after the fracture, a densitometric diagnosis was made and the patient received specific treatment in his outpatient follow-up through his health insurance plan. Methods A descriptive cross-sectional study was carried out in a university hospital in Bogota, Colombia. The data was collected by means of a questionnaire, administered to all patients admitted by the orthopedic emergency department with a diagnosis of fragility fracture. After discharge, a telephone follow-up was done every 3 months for 1 year, and patients were asked if they had already had the dual X-ray absorptiometry (DXA) scan and if they had begun osteoporosis treatment. Results A total of 111 patients with an average age of 74.4 years (+/- 11.3 years), of which 84 (75.6%) were women, all consulted for osteoporotic fracture at the orthopedic emergency department of the hospital. Hip fracture was the most frequent (51.4%), followed by vertebral (23.4%), wrist (22.5%), and humerus (4.5%) fracture. A total of 49.5% (n = 55) of the patients did not know what osteoporosis is; 58.6% (n = 65) did not know that fracture is the main complication of this disease, and 62.2% (n = 69) did not associate fractures with osteoporosis. All patients were educated about osteoporosis and the importance of diagnosing and treating it. Patients were given a medical order to have a DXA scan upon discharge; however, only 24.3% (n = 27) had the DXA scan in the first year of the fracture. A total of 33.3% (n = 37) received calcium plus vitamin D, and only 9.9% (n = 11) received osteoporosis treatment (7 bisphosphonate patients and 4 denosumab).

Despite the magnitude of the Colombian health system reform, introduced in 1993, changes in specialized medical practice have not been evaluated. This paper is the follow-up of a similar study on the practice of neurology done by the authors before the reform. Material and methods. Of the 62 members of the Colombian Association of Neurology living in Bogota 47 (76%) of them responded an anonymous survey inquiring on the characteristics of their medical practice and registering all the medical encounters during one week in October 1998. Results. Two thirds of the total working time is devoted by neurologists to clinical work. Half of the neurologists in the sample have invested in diagnostic equipment. There was no significant change in the total number of patients attended during the week, as compared with the 1993 study, and the diagnostic profile was similar. The proportion of private patients was significantly lower, while patients from prepaid medical schemes increased. Patients belonging to the Obligatory Health Plan, designed to cover lowest income population, and to prepaid medicine are not distributed homogeneously throughout all ages. The first year of life is particularly uncovered by the Obligatory Health Plan, while prepaid schemes do not address the problems of individuals age 60 or more. Conclusions. There has been a significant reduction in private practice compensated by an increase in prepaid medicine.

Methods: a cross-sectional study using data from the National Health Survey of 2007 was conducted. The sample was made up of 29 760 records of people aged 18 to 69 years from the main regions of Colombia. Results: in spite of the fact that 75 to 94 % of the surveyed people had heard about the condom, less than 22.2 % of them used it and the females showed the lowest indexes. Those persons with low schooling, no education at all, included in the subsidy system for the poor, and the displaced people were the ones who used the condom less in their first and their most recent sexual intercourses. Additionally, it was found that 13 (6.5 %) out of 209 people in a subsample used condom as a preventive action when they suffered some sexually transmitted infection. Conclusions: the use of condom by the Colombian population is low; there are structural-type social determinants related to this event like access to education and health services as well as gender-dependent cultural patterns of vulnerability.

Sampling was done in two different climatic seasons in 2006. Vegetation found (54 species belonging to 25 families) was dominated by species with high capability of adaptation to changing and disturbed environments. Richness and abundance of macrophytes were lower than those reported in other tropical aquatic systems. Variables associated with land use, such as temperature, conductivity and type of substrate of the streams mainly explained the structure of the macrophyte communities: streams running on meat-cattle areas-with higher temperatures, conductivity and dominance of sandy-slimy substrates-had higher macrophyte species richness and abundance than streams of protected-forest areas, with higher coverage of riparian vegetation, lower temperatures and conductivity and rocky substrates.",Article,"Unknown.; Valderrama Valderrama, Luz Teresa.; Rivera-Rondon, Carlos A.",Aquatic plants;Colombia;Habitats;Land uses;Mountain rivers;Tropical rivers,Aquatic plants;Colombia;Habitats;Land uses;Mountain rivers;Tropical rivers,Colombia;Colombia,

This survey aimed to evaluate the existence of financial burden caused by cancer on the caregiving families of terminally ill patients. Methods: We used the Covinsky Family Impact Scale in a telephone survey with families of patients who died from cancer between May 2019 and June 2020 in three Colombian hospitals. Results: We obtained answers of 176 caregivers, of whom 74.4 % indicated to have experienced at least one hardship of the Covinsky items. The most commonly reported financial hardship involved the use of all or most of the family savings for the care provided to the patient (45.6 %); 27.6 % indicated that a major source of family income was lost. A quarter (25 %) postponed educational or other important plans of family members and 10-11 % indicated to have moved to another home or postponed medical treatments. Conclusion: In Colombia, a country with universal health coverage, substantial financial impacts of terminal cancer care exist not only for patients, but also for family members and other caregivers. The system is failing to avoid financial toxicity of cancer among this group.

The Gulf of Tribuga is part of the breeding ground for humpback whale Stock G. Currently, no large-scale infrastructure exists on the Gulf's coastline, making it an area with high biodiversity and little anthropogenic noise. Whale-watching is one of the few human activities that contributes to the soundscape. By Morro Mico, on the southern limit of the Utria Natural National Park, an Ecological Acoustic Recorder (EAR, Oceanwide Science Institute) was deployed in the Gulf to record samples of acoustic activity from October to November 2018. It recorded for 10-min intervals with 20-min lapses for a duty cycle of 33.3%. One of the common peak frequencies of humpback whale song units from these recordings was used as input to an acoustic propagation model using the parabolic equation to simulate the communication space of a humpback whale when zero, one, and two boats are present. GPS positions of theodolite data from various whale watching scenarios in the Gulf were used to inform the models. Model results indicate that humpback whale song communication space could be reduced by as much as 63% in the presence of even one whale-watching boat. The boats traveling through the Gulf are the same as those used in whale-watching, and their engine noise while passing Morro Mico coincided with song structural and temporal changes observed in the acoustic data. Combining in situ data with acoustic models can advance the understanding of the spatio-temporal acoustic reactions of whales when their vocalizations are masked by boat noise.

Triage for HPV-positive women may challenge sensitivity of screening algorithms and women's follow-up, particularly in low- and middle-income countries (LMIC) where screening quality and protocol adherence are frequently deficient. We aimed to determine the accuracy of triage for HPV positive women in routine screening services from Colombia by a prospective cross-sectional study. Consecutively, HPV DNA-positive women underwent six triage strategies (conventional cytology, two methods of visual inspection, HPV16/18/45-genotyping, telomerase, and HPV mRNA). Positive triage results underwent regular colposcopy/ biopsy in public hospitals. Adjusted sensitivity, specificity, and predictive values for CIN2+/CIN3+ were estimated for stand-alone and combined tests. We explored the impact of triage strategies on referral rates and the complete screening algorithm (screening plus triage). Overall 16,242 women underwent HPV screening and 1789 (11.0%) were HPV-positive. In total, 20.1% of women were lost to follow-up. mRNA showed the highest positivity rate (0.64 among HPV-positive and 0.05 among the total screened cohort), the highest sensitivity (0.94 95%CI 0.75-0.96), and the lowest specificity (0.36 95%CI 0.29-0.43). Parallel testing with HPV-mRNA revealed the highest increase in sensitivity for all triage strategies. Accuracy of cytology and visual inspection differ between screening units but parallel testing with HPV16/18/45 genotyping significantly increased their sensitivity (over 0.80). Morphology-based triage for HPV-positive women remains a suitable alternative for routine practice in LMIC if combined with HPV16/18/45-genotyping; however, point-of-care triage would be preferable to reduce losses to follow-up.

Predation was not consistently different between nests placed in fragments and controls. However, we found that nests on the ground had a higher daily probability of being predated than nests in the understory. Also, daily nest mortality rate (DNM) was higher in the wet season than in the dry season. Most of the predated nests were attributed to mammals (56%), and predation occurred mostly on the ground (78%). Our estimates of DNM are quite low congruent to 0.023) and similar to another Neotropical montane forest and other Neotropical sites. Comparisons of DNM between Neotropical and temperate sites suggests that predation rates are similar.

To estimate the burden of disease of COVID-19 in the department of Nariño, Colombia, based on the disability-adjusted life years (DALYs) between March 2020 and August 2021. Materials and methods. The description and characterization of COVID-19 cases reported between March 2020 and August 2021 was made according to age groups, sex, ethnicity, municipalities of residence and subregions of Nariño by using information from the national surveillance system SIVIGILA. Crude and cumulative mortality rates for COVID-19 were estimated for the previously described variables. Years lost due to premature death (YLL) and years lived with disability (YLD) were calculated. Total DALYs were estimated by adding YLL + YLD. These were calculated by sex, ethnicity, age group and subregions of Nariño. Relative risks were estimated from rate ratios (RR) and 95% confidence intervals for the study variables. Results. The highest morbidity, mortality and DALY rates occurred between February and September 2021, in men, in those older than 70 years, in the Afro-des-cendant ethnic minority group and in the Central, Obando and Juanambú subregions. The burden of disease of COVID-19 in Nariño during the study period is attributed to the YLL, which explain more than 97% of it. Conclusions. This is one of the first studies on burden of disease at the regional level, carried out in Colombia, that employs a standardized methodology for COVID-19.

In Colombia, its prevalence is 25% with a high mortality rate. The psychosocial factors affecting pharmacological adherence among patients have not been sufficiently studied and despite international evidence on their impact, in Colombia, there is a paucity of research on the role of chronic stress in the relationship between socioeconomic status and pharmacological adherence. Objective: To examine the role of chronic stress in the relationship between socioeconomic status and pharmacological adherence in hypertensive patients aged 45 to 70 years old in three Colombian cities between 2015 and 2016. Materials and methods: We conducted a cross-sectional study in a population of hypertensive patients. Data for this study came from the first wave of longitudinal study aimed at examining social factors associated with the control of hypertension in Bogota, Medellin, and Quibdo. Patients with hypertension were selected randomly from a sample of those participating in the hypertension control program De todo corazon. For the statistical analysis of the data, we used factorial analysis and multivariate regressions. Results: We found a positive association between socioeconomic status and the degree of pharmacological adherence and a negative one with chronic stress. Besides, evidence was found that stress has a negative association with the degree of adherence. Conclusions: The results suggest that stress is not a likely mediator between socioeconomic status and the pharmacological adherence of hypertensive patients in Colombia.

We performed a concordance study of five methodologies for the species identification of oral isolates of Candida in Colombia. Methods: Sixty-seven Candida isolates were tested by; API (R) 20C-AUX, Vitek (R) 2 Compact, Vitek (R) MS, Microflex (R) and a molecular test (panfungal PCR and sequencing). The commercial cost and processing time of the samples was done by graphical analysis. Results: Panfungal PCR differentiated 12 species of Candida, Vitek (R) MS and Microflex (R) methods identified 9 species, and API (R) 20C-AUX and Vitek (R) 2 Compact methods identified 8 species each.

Due to the lack of anti-COVID-19 therapies, decision-makers require timely and accurate data to estimate the incidence of disease and the availability of hospital resources to contain the pandemic. Methods: We adapted an existing model to the local context to forecast COVID-19 incidence and hospital resource use assuming different scenarios: (1) the implementation of quarantine from September 1st to October 15th (average daily growth rate of 2%); (2-3) partial restrictions (at 4% and 8% growth rates); and (4) no restrictions, assuming a 10% growth rate. Previous scenarios with predictions from June to August were also presented. We estimated the number of new cases, diagnostic tests required, and the number of available hospital and intensive care unit (ICU) beds (with and without ventilators) for each scenario. Results: We estimated 67,700 cases by October 15th when assuming the implementation of a quarantine, 80,400 and 101,500 cases when assuming partial restrictions at 4% and 8% infection rates, respectively, and 208,500 with no restrictions. According to different scenarios, the estimated demand for reverse transcription-polymerase chain reaction tests ranged from 202,000 to 1,610,600 between September 1st and October 15th. The model predicted depletion of hospital and ICU beds by September 20th if all restrictions were to be lifted and the infection growth rate increased to 10%. Conclusion: Slowly lifting social distancing restrictions and reopening the economy is not expected to result in full resource depletion by October if the daily growth rate is maintained below 8%. Increasing the number of available beds provides a safeguard against slightly higher infection rates.

In our country there are no Fellowships in this area. Bogota seems to have the majority of attending PU specialist, with the rest of the country being cared for by general urologists or pediatric surgeons. They have dedicated a lot of years in this practice, achieving a place for this specialty between colleges and our health care system. With the present study we want to establish a diagnosis of PU status to identify the needs that exist in the different regions of the country and make institutional recommendations on the education and distribution of sub-specialists in Colombia. Materials and Methods: An e-mail was sent with 21 questions to the specialists registered in the Colombian Urology Society and Colombian Pediatric Society. Results: Approximately 550 questionnaires were sent, and 127 were answered by 111 urologists and 16 pediatric surgeons. Half (50%) of them had their clinical practice in Bogotá, 30% in smaller cities such as Cali, Barranquilla and Medellin, and the remaining 20% in the rest of the country. The results were divided in two groups; those who dedicate less than 10% of their clinical practice to PU, 55% of the specialists. Of the 45% of respondents who dedicated more time, one quarter of them dedicated more than 60% of their time to this practice. Also, around a half of them work in Bogotá, and 32% reports to have formal education in pediatric urology. Even though, 60% see less than 50 outpatients a week, and half of them perform less than 10 surgeries a month. Conclusions: In Colombia, PU is practiced in larger cities, mainly in Bogotá. There are a lot of areas in the country with lack of care. Specialists that report to have a significant practice in pediatric patients do not see enough outpatients, and do not perform enough surgeries.

Methods The authors in Bogota describe three recent studies. The first one collected data from clinical records to evaluate the prescriptions patterns in recently graduated physicians. The second used an interrupted time series design, with a set of observations prior and after a combined intervention, to assess whether it improved the quality of intravenous antibiotic prescribing practices in a university-based hospital. The third evaluated pharmacists' advice in childhood acute respiratory infection and acute diarrhea through a community survey, followed by focus groups and in-depth interviews of key informers. Results The ethical issues raised by these studies include the need for obtaining informed consent from participants (physicians in Study I and drug sellers in Study 3), deciding when to intervene in case of gross prescription mistakes detected during the collection of data as part of the time series assessment (Study 2), the use of simulated clients to collect data in the community survey, and the use of study resources to buy, in some cases, useless medications (Study 3). Conclusion Although ethical challenges in pharmacoepidemiology in non-industrialized countries like Colombia may be different from those in developed nations, ethical principles that guide research remain the same. The processes to safeguard these principles in Colombia for virtually all research are also universal in nature, and include the ethical review committee, subject privacy, informed consent, and disclosure of funding sources.

Taking the standardised Colombian high-school leaving test (Saber 11) is obligatory for students to graduate from high school and is also used for rating students applying to Colombian universities; it has been adapted for evaluating young people having hearing physical, visual and auditory disabilities. Objectives Describing and characterising the profile of students suffering from disability (SWD) who presented the standardized Colombian high-school leaving test in 2009. Materials and methods. A descriptive secondary analysis was made of the standardised Colombian high-school leaving test database concerning SWD who took the test in 2009. A disability certificate must have been obtained beforehand and presented during registration for the test. The prevalence of SWD taking the test was calculated, their scores were recorded and univariate statistics were used for the social, demographic and economic characterisation of their profile. Results. 529,651 students took the test for the first time in 2009; 0.2% (842) of these students claimed to have some type of disability during registration. 35.0% (295) of these had a motor disability, 34.9% (294) had a hearing disability and were assisted by a sign language interpreter, 19.1% (161) were visually impaired and 11.5% (97) had a hearing disability but did not receive assistance from a sign language interpreter.

The average unbiased expected heterozygosity levels ranged from 0.098 (Lu. youngi) to 0.215 (Lu. torvida). The five species samples, taken all the isoenzymes employed, were significantly deviated from the Hardy-Weinberg equilibrium by homozygous excess with classical as well as Markov chain exact tests. Possible causes: (1) Wahlund effect within populations due to subdivision and/or sampling. Endogamy could be discarded because these loci were affected by highly different levels of homozygous excess. (2) Null alleles could be not discarded, at least for some isoenzymes. The hierarchical Wright's F analysis showed high and significant values for each parameter. The average FIT value was 0.655 with a conspicous homozygous excess at a global level (all species taken together); the average FIS value was significantly positive (0.515) as well, with homozygous excess within each species. The genetic heterogeneity between the fives species was noteworthy (FST = 0.288), indicating clear genetic differentiation. The more related species pairs were Lu. longiflocosa-Lu. torvida (0.959) and Lu torvida-Lu. spinicrassa (0.960); while Lu. torvida-Lu. youngi (0.805) and Lu. quasitownsendi-Lu. youngi (0.796) were the most divergent (Nei's genetic identity matrix). UPGMA and Wagner algorithms showed that the most divergent species was Lu. youngi, whereas the most related were Lu. longiflocosa-Lu. torvida and Lu torvida-Lu. spinicrassa.

,,,2,WOS:000608208400001,2021,Healthcare access barriers for FARC ex-combatants in Colombia: qualitative perspectives from healthcare providers and FARC health promoters,"Background Following the 2016 Peace Agreement with the Fuerzas Armadas Revolucionarias de Colombia (FARC), Colombia promised to reincorporate more than 13,000 guerrilla fighters into its healthcare system. Despite a subsidized healthcare insurance program and the establishment of 24 Espacios Territoriales de Capacitacion y Reincorporacion (ETCRs-Territorial Spaces for Training and Reintegration) to facilitate this transition, data has shown that FARC ex-combatants access care at disproportionately lower rates, and face barriers to healthcare services. Methods Semi-structured interviews were conducted with FARC health promoters and healthcare providers working in ETCRs to determine healthcare access barriers for FARC ex-combatants. Analysis was completed with a qualitative team-based coding method and barriers were categorized according to Julio Frenk's Domains of Healthcare Access framework. Results Among 32 participants, 25 were healthcare providers and 7 self-identified as FARC health promoters. The sample was majority female (71.9%) and worked with the FARC for an average of 12 months in hospital, health center, medical brigade, and ETCR settings. Our sample had experiences with FARC across 16 ETCRs in 13 Departments of Colombia. Participants identified a total of 141 healthcare access barriers affecting FARC ex-combatants, which affected healthcare needs, desires, seeking, initiation and continuation. Significant barriers were related to a lack of resources in rural areas, limited knowledge of the Colombian health system, the health insurance program, perceived stigma, and transition process from the FARC health system. Conclusions FARC ex-combatants face significant healthcare access barriers, some of which are unique from other low-resource populations in Colombia. Potential solutions to these barriers included health insurance provider partnerships with health centers close to ETCRs, and training and contracting FARC health promoters to be primary healthcare providers in ETCRs. Future studies are needed to quantify the healthcare barriers affecting FARC ex-combatants, in order to implement targeted interventions to improve healthcare access.",Article,"Reynolds, C.W.; Aguiar, L.G.; Arbelaez, C.; Restrepo, C.G.; Patino, A.; Carranza, H.; Pileika, L.; Duarte, A.",Healthcare access barriers; FARC ex-combatant; Colombia; Global health; Armed conflict; Reintegration,Healthcare access barriers;FARC ex-combatant;Colombia;Global health;Armed conflict;Reintegration,United States;Colombia,2-s2.0-85098966493

This study aimed to capture the perspectives of key stakeholders, both experts and community members, on consent processes and preferences for participation in automated mobile phone surveys (MPS) of non-communicable disease risk factors in Colombia. We conducted semi-structured interviews with ethics and digital health experts and focus group discussions with community representatives. There was meaningful disagreement within both groups regarding the necessity of consent, when the purpose of a survey is to contribute to the formulation of public policies. Respondents who favored consent emphasized that consent communications ought to promote understanding and voluntariness, and implicitly suggested that information disclosure conform to areasonable personstandard. Given the automated and unsolicited nature of the phone calls and concerns regarding fraud, trust building was emphasized as important, especially for national MPS deployment. Community sensitization campaigns that provide relevant contextual information (such as the name of the administering institution) were thought to support trust-building.

Its diagnosis is a highly complex task, for which modelling through automated methods has been attempted. A systematic review of the literature was performed on diagnostic tests that applied intelligent systems tools in the diagnosis of acute coronary syndromes. Methods: A systematic review of the literature is presented using Medline, Embase, Scopus, IEEE/IET Electronic Library, ISI Web of Science, Latindex and LILACS databases for articles that include the diagnostic evaluation of acute coronary syndromes using intelligent systems. The review process was conducted independently by 2 reviewers, and discrepancies were resolved through the participation of a third person. The operational characteristics of the studied tools were extracted. Results: A total of 35 references met the inclusion criteria. In 22 (62.8%) cases, neural networks were used. In five studies, the performances of several intelligent systems tools were compared. Thirteen studies sought to perform diagnoses of all acute coronary syndromes, and in 22, only infarctions were studied. In 21 cases, clinical and electrocardiographic aspects were used as input data, and in 10, only electrocardiographic data were used. Most intelligent systems use the clinical context as a reference standard. High rates of diagnostic accuracy were found with better performance using neural networks and support vector machines, compared with statistical tools of pattern recognition and decision trees. Conclusions: Extensive evidence was found that shows that using intelligent systems tools achieves a greater degree of accuracy than some clinical algorithms or scales and, thus, should be considered appropriate tools for supporting diagnostic decisions of acute coronary syndromes.

A comparative study between Chile and Colombia,"The objective of this research was to study the transformations in the way of working and in the journalistic routines in the main digital media in Chile and Colombia. It investigated how journalistic routines were forcibly modified due to the restrictions imposed by the Covid-19 pandemic and what job challenges inherent to the profession journalists from these media had to face. The six most read news portals in each country were chosen according to the Alexa.com ranking. Twelve semi-structured interviews were conducted with editors and directors of digital press media to make a comparative study. The main results show that journalistic routines were adapted to the contingency. Some changed notably, such as access to sources and the relationship with the interviewees, teleworking and the use of technologies to collect and produce news. Others were strengthened, such as the editorial meeting and the editor's relationship with his work team. It is concluded that the media played a fundamental role during the pandemic by informing citizens about health measures and counteracting the fake news disseminated by social networks.

It involves local uses of shared resources, like common-pool contexts for which self-governance has avoided ‘tragedies of the commons’. Yet even ideal local governance of SSGM is not societally efficient given non-local damages that suggest external interventions for desired shifts. Because transactions costs are high for rewarding reductions in damages on remote mining frontiers, states could gain if rewards based on low-cost, group compliance measures could successfully induce cooperation in response to policy. However, as group-level rewards invite free-riding, such success requires local collective action. Since that guarantees neither efficient coordination nor equitable distributions of net benefits from compliance, we consider the impacts of emergent leaders on local responses to external policy. We employ framed lab experiments with 200 small-scale gold miners in Colombia's Pacific to explore leaders’ impacts on equity and efficiency in collective responses to external incentives. Allowing communication before individual choice, which raises efficiency but not always equity, we can identify emergent leaders of groups’ communications. Leaders raise compliance and affect how its costs are distributed, suggesting access to leadership roles matters.",Article,"Rodriguez, Luz A.; Velez, Maria Alejandra.; Pfaff, Alexander",Collective action;Colombia;Environmental policy;Equity;Lab-in-field experiments;Leaders;Small-scale gold mining,Collective action;Colombia;Environmental policy;Equity;Lab-in-field experiments;Leaders;Small-scale gold mining,Colombia;Colombia;United States,WOS:000690872400013

Therefore, there is little information about the structure, dynamics and function of their macrophyte communities. In this research, aquatic plant communities of 18 Andean streams of La Vieja (Quindio) and Otun (Risaralda) river basins were studied; those are some of the basins most affected by anthropic activities in the country. Streams were selected according to their association with the main land's uses of the region in both basins. The aim of the study was to evaluate the effect of land use on the structure of macrophyte communities. Streams running exclusively through each land use were selected. Sampling was done in two different climatic seasons in 2006. Vegetation found (54 species belonging to 25 families) was dominated by species with high capability of adaptation to changing and disturbed environments. Richness and abundance of macrophytes were lower than those reported in other tropical aquatic systems. Variables associated with land use, such as temperature, conductivity and type of substrate of the streams mainly explained the structure of the macrophyte communities: streams running on meat-cattle areas -with higher temperatures, conductivity and dominance of sandy-slimy substrates- had higher macrophyte species richness and abundance than streams of protected-forest areas, with higher coverage of riparian vegetation, lower temperatures and conductivity and rocky substrates.",Article,"Gomez Rodriguez, A.M.; Valderrama Valderrama, L.T.; Rivera-Rondon, C.A.",aquatic plants; Colombia; habitats; land uses; mountain rivers; tropical rivers,aquatic plants;Colombia;habitats;land uses;mountain rivers;tropical rivers;AQUATIC MACROPHYTES;SPECIES RICHNESS;LOWLAND STREAMS;DIVERSITY;HABITAT;WATER;GRADIENT;DRIVERS;PLANTS,Colombia,

From the perspective of social mobility, we consider the dynamics of life opportunities in a class of origin and a class of destination as the product of intra- or inter-generational changes. Despite the diversity of methods and cut-off points to define and measure social classes, we highlight the growth of the middle class in Colombia and Latin America during the last decade. In Colombia, however, this growth is framed in the paradoxical situation of a persisting concentration of income. The changes within the class experiencing that social mobility help explain the paradox. Likewise, we identify the theories and approaches used to analyze social class and social mobility in sociology and economics, where interdisciplinary crossings are particularly favorable as they integrate the analysis of social stratification with the processes of production and distribution of wealth. We review the methods employed to carry out studies of social mobility and the sources for the data, and also show how social mobility has become part of the economic and social public policy agenda. Finally, we present those studies on the evaluation component of the analysis of the middle class, which state that it is not clear whether this class has a homogeneous set of values or a majority position in favor of democracy. As part of the conclusions, we affirm that although the analysis of social mobility on the basis of social classes is adequate at the conceptual level, in practice, the expansion of the middle class in Colombia has brought about more opportunities for this population group. However, that class is threatened due to its vulnerability and substantial improvements in policies are required in order to alleviate the concentration of income.",Article,"Mallarino, C.U.; Moreno, J.R.",Colombia; inequality; middle class; social class; social mobility,Colombia;inequality;middle class;social class;social mobility,Colombia,2-s2.0-85072753048

Nevertheless, data regarding the mutation spectrum for MPS IVA in this population have not been completely characterized. Forty-seven families and 53 patients from seven different Colombian regions were tested for MPS IVA mutations. We compared the sequences with the N-acetylgalactosamine-6-sulfatase (GALNS) reference sequence NM_000512.4, and gene variants were reported. Bioinformatics analysis was performed using SWISS-MODEL. The mutant proteins were generated by homology from the wild-type GALNS 4FDJ template obtained from the PDB database, and visualization was performed using Swiss-PDBViewer and UCSF Chimera. The predictive analysis was run using different bioinformatic tools, and the deleterious annotation of genetic variants was performed using a neural network. We found that 79% and 21% of the cohort was homozygous and compound heterozygous, respectively. The most frequent mutation observed was p.Gly301Cys (78.3% of alleles), followed by p.Arg386Cys (10.4% of alleles). A novel mutation (p.Phe72Ile) was described and classified in silico as a pathogenic variant. This study reveals the mutation spectrum of MPS IVA in Colombia. The high prevalence of the p.Gly301Cys mutation suggests a founder effect of this variant in the Colombian population that causes diseases in the Andean region (via migration).

Design - Cross-sectional survey. Setting - Primary Care Health Centers in the city of Bogota. Strategy - The Health District Department of Bogota (Secretaria Distrital de Salud) provided the sampling frame of SILOS (Local Health System) and UPAS (primary health service units) with a physician in the social work year. Samples of patient- physician encounters for the three tracer conditions within UPAS were examined, and detailed information collected on prescription indicators. Results - Information was collected on a total of 1099 patient-physician encounters. Results show that 61% (95% CI: 58.6-63.1) of prescriptions in these settings are non-generic, and only 62% (95% CI:59.5-64.0) are from the Colombian essential drug list. Number of medications prescribed per encounter were higher with ARI, as well as prescriptions for non-generic forms, antibiotics, and medications outside of the Colombian essential drug list. Inappropriate prescriptions were seen in 31% (95% CI:28.1-33.7) of all encounters.

Studies assessing the prevalence of systemic hypertension in Colombia have included main cities and small regions. However, there is no available data regarding the country as a whole. Objective: To describe the prevalence of systemic hypertension according to reports made to the official information systems in Colombia. Method: The prevalence of systemic hypertension was calculated through the extraction and analysis of data contained within the SISPRO tool, the official information system for the Colombian Ministry of Health and Social Protection. The prevalence was then standardized by age, and for the different geographical regions of the country in the period comprised between years 2013 and 2017. Results: During the five years of follow-up, we located 12,386,343 registries reporting systemic hypertension as a main diagnosis. The lowest prevalence (4.65%) was found in year 2013, and the highest prevalence (5.83%) was found in 2017.

Between 2008 and 2010, Colombia undertook a national baseline serosurvey of unprecedented scale, which led to an estimated seroprevalence of T. solium cysticercus antibodies among the general population of 8.6%. Here, we use contemporary geostatistical approaches to analyse this unique dataset with the aim of understanding the spatial distribution and risk factors associated with human cysticercosis in Colombia to inform how best to target intervention strategies. Methods: We used a geostatistical model to estimate individual and household risk factors associated with seropositivity to T. solium cysticercus antibodies from 29,253 people from 133 municipalities in Colombia. We used both independent and spatially structured random effects at neighbourhood/village and municipality levels to account for potential clustering of exposure to T. solium. We present estimates of the distribution and residual correlation of seropositivity at the municipality level. Results: High seroprevalence was identified in municipalities located in the north and south of Colombia, with spatial correlation in seropositivity estimated up to approximately 140 km. Statistically significant risk factors associated with seropositivity to T. solium cysticercus were related to age, sex, educational level, socioeconomic status, use of rainwater, consumption of partially cooked/raw pork meat and possession of dogs. Conclusions: In Colombia, the distribution of human cysticercosis is influenced by socioeconomic considerations, education and environmental factors related to the spread of T. solium eggs. This information can be used to tailor national intervention strategies, such as targeting spatial hotspots and more highly exposed groups, including displaced people and women. Large-scale seroprevalence surveys accompanied by geospatial mapping are an essential step towards reaching the WHO's 2021-2030 NTD roadmap targets.",Article,"Galipo, E.; Dixon, M.A.; Fronterre, C.; Cucunuba, Z.M.; Basanez, M.G.; Stevens, K.; Sanchez, A.C.F.; Walker, M.",Taenia solium; Cysticercosis; Risk factors; Spatial analysis; Geostatistics; Colombia,Taenia solium;Cysticercosis;Risk factors;Spatial analysis;Geostatistics;Colombia;TAENIA-SOLIUM TAENIASIS;PREVALENCE;INFECTION;COMMUNITY;EPIDEMIOLOGY;POPULATION;STRATEGIES;VILLAGE;EGGS,United Kingdom;Colombia,2-s2.0-85120076130

Several geological, ecological, and zoological studies, both marine and terrestrial, have been conducted in this island. Despite some marginal comments on some publications, no single specific survey has been devoted to botany so far. In order to make a floristic inventory of the terrestrial flora of this island, three field trips were made in 2010 to collect vascular plants, mosses, and lichens, as well as data on their distribution within the island. We collected and identified 25 species of lichens, two species of vascular plants and one moss. Lichens were the most diverse group found, including records of four new genera (Endocarpon, Fuscidea, Lecanographa and Verrucaria) and 13 new species for Colombia. The high lichen richness on Malpelo might be explained by their efficient form of asexual reproduction (soredia and isidia), that may have facilitated their transport to the island by migrating birds or wind. Once on the island, it is possible that lichens persist by being chemically protected against herbivores. The great number of new generic and species records for Colombia is explained by the low number of studies in saxicolous lichens conducted so far in the country, particularly on coastal areas and remote islands. Only two species of vascular plants were collected, a grass, Paspalum sp., and a fern, Pityrogramma calomelanos, and both of them correspond to new determinations for Malpelo. A moss species previously reported but with no positive identification was collected and identified as Octoblepharum albidum. Other species previously reported, for example, some species of shrubs, were not observed. The low number of vascular plants is probably due to a combination of soil conditions and herbivory by land crabs. This study is the first complete inventory of the flora of Malpelo and is a starting and reference point for future comparisons among islands in the Eastern Tropical Pacific.",Article,"Gonzalez-Roman, R.D.; Lopez-Victoria, M.; Silverstone-Sopkin, P.A.",Colombia; Malpelo Island; vascular plants; Bryophyte; saxicolous lichens,Colombia;Malpelo Island;vascular plants;Bryophyte;saxicolous lichens,Colombia,2-s2.0-84901068172

The index is analyzed from January, 1930 to December, 1998. The inflation rate covers the same period; the inflation rate as measured by the Consumer Price Index. The results of this analysis show that monthly and per annum return-nominal and real-are well below from the expected return of any financial investor. A first hypothesis to explain this is that the investor and entrepreneurs receive benefits that are non-measurable in terms of economic return. Also it can be said that inflation is negative to the return at the stock market, thus: the larger the inflation rate, the smaller the real return. It is shown that the market does not anticipate the future inflation, and of course it is not included in the actual price. Probabilities for selected real return values are presented. The probability to obtain a real return greater than 0% and other values (5%, 10%, 12% and 18%) as well, is much less than 50%.

Leaf modification involves energetic and defense costs that should be balanced by the benefits of tent-roosting. The alteration of the leaf's vascular system reduces the tent's life expectancy, so to obtain a benefit, bats are expected to use tents regularly as long as they remain functional and not modify more leaves than necessary. Over 2 yr, we documented the dynamics of tent construction and use by Uroderma convexum and other bat species in the palm Sabal mauritiiformis in a Colombian transitional dry forest. We also assessed tent condition and compared it to nonmodified leaves of approximately the same age in focal palms. Probability of tent use by U.convexum varied between 57 percent during a reproductive period and 4 percent outside of this period. Bats cut the main vein of folioles, partially affecting water transport in the leaf. However, there were no differences between tents and nonmodified leaves in deterioration scores or deterioration rates over 1 yr. During 2 yr, 48 tents were lost for different causes, but this loss was balanced by the construction of 51 new tents. Thus, bats maintained an excess of usable tents. Palm leaves are long-lived and seem preadapted to sustain damage and remain viable, particularly in species growing in dry environments.

,,,2,WOS:000436459500005,2018,The sectoral dimension of Colombian cooperativism through a Social Network Analysis,"Context. An unprecedented increase in the constitution and productive activity of cooperatives took place in Colombia in 2003-2010 period, reaching a very significant weight in the economy. Subsequently, the regulation of the Associated Work Cooperatives supposed the disappearance of a very important number of them, that it explains the temporary delimitation of this paper. This period was also limited by the availability of information, which was aggravated by the disappearance of the Center for Research on Cooperativism of Colombia and the consequent deceleration in the investigations on the issue because of it was the main user and possessor of disaggregated data of cooperativism. However, according to the comparative information that has been consulted for the Colombian economy and its cooperative segment, the cooperatives were more than 8,500, which paid compensations to 140,000 employees; they gave work to almost 540,000 people if the workers of Associated Work Cooperatives were included, and they were generating of just over Colombian Pesos 8.5 trillion GDP - 12 digits-. This assumed 0.4 percent of the active entities in Colombia, according to the data from CONFECOOP and the DANE's Annual Survey of Manufacturing, which represented almost 1.5 percent of employees in Colombia, proportion that rose up 3 percent if the employees in Associated Work Cooperatives were considered. At the same time, cooperativism GDP reached almost 1.7 percent of the national GDP, starting in 2003 with the half of that participation. Thus, it is showed the remarkable importance of the cooperative sector in the Colombian economy, which achieved very similar sectoral proportions of the national employment and entities as the case of Mining branches, that weighted half of the GVA generated by Energy or Financial Intermediation sectors in the Colombian economy -3.5 and 5.1 percent of the Colombian GVA, respectively- and they assumed 1.2 percent of total entities and 1.1 percent of total employment. In parallel, cooperativism employees of the Construction branches were 5 percent of the Colombian employees. These aspects were technical consequences of the productive specialization of the Colombian cooperativism services sectors in production, entities and employment, such as Financial Intermediation, Education, Health and Social Services, which also increased their specialization index. Methods. It is possible to study what extent it is possible to create an intersectoral relations network as a centralized structure through the Social Networks Analysis. On this issue, three indicators bring us the required knowledge: density, the percentage of the links over the possible -total- relationships; cohesion, defined in theory of networks as the effort to relate between nodes, what determines the number of relationships on the shortest path between two nodes; and the degree of centralization -Network Centralization Index, NCI- which is the variability in degrees as a percentage of the maximum centralization; that is to say, in relation to the star network structure, that shows the maximum power of a single productive sector. Graph Theory principles allow us to observe the differences between the national and cooperativism networks (inter-sectoral relations) in order to determine the power of certain productive sectors or the meaning of the centrality and centralization indicators in them. Always under a different approach, which could enrich the conventional interpretation with the (Social Networks) Graphs and their indicators. In addition, the intermediate position of a productive sector between other sectors means their power over the transactions between non-adjacent branches; that is to say, counting relations between two sectors not directly related. Thus, the indicator reflects the power of the mostly intermediary productive branch, either to spread their beneficial or damaging effects. The Financial Intermediation is a good example of a sector with intermediary power, which would reach alternative consequences according to growth or recessive dynamics. Results and future research. On a sector basis, the Colombian cooperativism was concentrated in Education, Health and Other Personal and Community Services, Financial Intermediation and Trade and Hospitality: they obtained almost 75 percent of GVA and employment, while the same national sectors contributed to those indicators between 40 and 50 percent. Moreover, the cooperative concentration grew in Manufacturing, Financial Intermediation and Education, Health and Other Personal and Community Services. Furthermore, if it is compared the structures of intersectoral relations between total economy and cooperativism in the period we find some differences although the motor branches are the same: Manufacturing, Construction, Trade and Hospitality and Transport and Communications. However, the cooperative sectors were adapted to business cycle and increased their participations, especially in Trade and Hospitality branches. In parallel, the cooperatives of the Financial Intermediation sector had -and they have- a considerable weight, both in the cooperativism and in the same national sector. Moreover, they increased their participations, both in the cooperativism and in the national sectors, and they maintained their backward and forward effects below the average of the Cooperative sector, as the case of the national Financial Intermediation sector. The effects of the cooperativism in that period, either on employment or on inter-sectoral terms, were lower than the same effects on the national economy, and they were generating more indirect employment than the same national sectors, in response to the increases in demand. That might imply that cooperativism it had a competitive disadvantage with respect to the national productive structure, which was more specialized in weak-medium demand sectors. In addition, under the Social Networks Analysis, cooperatives were adapted to the economic expansion by increasing the cohesion of their inter-sectoral graphs, so they will have opposite effects in recessive phases, with the exception of Electricity, Gas and Water Supplies, Construction, Trade and Hospitality and Financial Intermediation, the branches which cooperativism achieved the greater proportion of the direct employment. The graphs of the cooperativism -their inter-sectoral relations- were more centralized structures than the national economy ones because of Manufacturing, Financial Intermediation and the Agricultural sector. Whereas Manufacturing, Business Services, Agricultural sector and Transport and Communications -a key sector in the dynamics of globalization-centralized the network of the national economy, which did not and still does not have the same role in the cooperative graphs. Consequently, the graphs that represented the networks of the Colombian national economy were more dense and cohesive than cooperative ones, while they were evolving, which meant a certain convergence between them. In short, the adaptation of the Colombian cooperativism to the economic and social development stage, between 2003 and 2010, supposed cohesion of its networks, although some differences is maintained in the productive core of the national economy based on the quantity responses to the business cycle. All the foregoing figures redounds in a good help to support the initial studies of the impact of cooperativism on the national economy, particularly to promote the strengthening of peaceful coexistence in Colombia. Consequently, the Colombian cooperatives are seeking to optimize their possible functions as organizers of the territory and mediators of peaceful coexistence. Thus, the studies on sectoral impact and on the impact evaluation of public policies will need to know many more social and economic indicators as essential elements to ensure a construction of public policies bringing together Cooperatives, Solidarity Organizations, Academy and Government.",Article,"Conde, M.A.A.; Alvarez, J.F.",Social Networks Analysis; System National Accounts; Cooperativism; Impact Evaluation; Sectoral Analysis; Public Policies; Colombia,Social Networks Analysis;System National Accounts;Cooperativism;Impact Evaluation;Sectoral Analysis;Public Policies;Colombia,Spain;Colombia,2-s2.0-85070390287

We conducted logistic regression analyses using the 2007 Colombian National Health Survey. Taking into account undetected cases (individuals with fasting glucose tests ≥ 126 mg/dL reporting no previous diabetes diagnosis), we found a diabetes prevalence of 5% in Colombia, where 1/3 are undetected cases. Undetected individuals are as likely as detected diabetics to visit a physician during the last 12 months. Despite we found no differences in prevalence between urban and rural settings, diagnoses rates were lower in the later, challenging traditional conceptions on urban diabetes and supporting the hypothesis of a supply-side issue driving undetected diabetes in Colombia. We discuss UD in Colombia using a supply-demand framework. These lessons may be extrapolated to other Latin American countries where policymakers will find them useful to improve diabetes screening activities.

Up to 40% of FTD is familial and an estimated 15% to 40% is due to single-gene mutations. It has been estimated that the G4C2 hexanucleotide repeat expansions in the C9ORF72 gene can explain up to 37.5% of the familial cases of FTD, especially in populations of Caucasian origin. The purpose of this paper is to evaluate hereditary risk across the clinical phenotypes of FTD and the frequency of the G4C2 expansion in a Colombian cohort diagnosed with FTD.</p> Methods: A total of 132 FTD patients were diagnosed according to established criteria in the behavioral variant FTD, logopenic variant PPA, non-fluent agrammatic PPA, and semantic variant PPA. Hereditary risk across the clinical phenotypes was established in four categories that indicate the pathogenic relationship of the mutation: high, medium, low, and apparently sporadic, based on those proposed by Wood and collaborators. All subjects were also examined for C9ORF72 hexanucleotide expansion (defined as >30 repetitions).</p> Results: There were no significant differences in the demographic characteristics of the patients between the clinical phenotypes of FTD. The higher rate phenotype was bvFTD (62.12%). In accordance with the risk classification, we found that 72 (54.4%) complied with the criteria for the sporadic cases; for the familial cases, 23 (17.4%) fulfilled the high-risk criteria, 23 (17.4%) fulfilled the low risk criteria, and 14 (10.6%) fulfilled the criteria to be classified as subject to medium risk. C9ORF72 expansion frequency was 0.76% (1/132).</p> Conclusion: The FTD heritability presented in this research was very similar to the results reported in the literature. The C9ORF72 expansion frequency was low. Colombia is a triethnic country, with a high frequency of genetic Amerindian markers; this shows consistency with the present results of a low repetition frequency. This study provides an initial report of the frequency for the hexanucleotide repeat expansions in C9ORF72 in patients with FTD in a Colombian population and paves the way for further study of the possible genetic causes of FTD in Colombia.</p>",Article,"Lopez-Caceres, A.; Velasco-Rueda, M.; Garcia-Cifuentes, E.; Zarante, I.; Matallana, D.",C9ORF72; frontotemporal dementia; Colombia; family inheritance; heritability,C9ORF72;frontotemporal dementia;Colombia;family inheritance;heritability;HEXANUCLEOTIDE REPEAT EXPANSION;LOBAR DEGENERATION;PREVALENCE;GENETICS;CRITERIA;SUBTYPES;NUMBER;FTD;ALS,Colombia,2-s2.0-85114830437

Based on this, this study presents the general panorama of academic production across Colombian higher education institutions that offer doctoral training programs in psychology. The academic production was obtained from the Scopus database in a sample of 13 universities. After this search, 1345 documents were found with which an analysis was made regarding productivity indicators and the collaboration networks within the discipline in the country were identified. Subsequently, this information was contrasted with the national information registered in the Latin American and Caribbean Curriculum Vitae system (CvLAC) of 193 professors associated with the universities offering doctoral programs.

Other data originate from non-governmental institutions and healthcare providers within Colombia, official sources, expert opinion, Colombian legislation, and the Cancer Mortality Atlas publishes by Colombian National Cancer Institute. Results In Colombia, the age-standardized incidence rate remained relatively stable between 2012 and 2020 (43.1 to 47.8 cases per 100,000 women-years); Additionally, survival since 1995 has presented a substantial improvement from 65.7 to 72.1. In 33% of cases, the diagnosis of breast cancer was made in advanced stages, stage III or higher. The health demography survey conducted in 2015 showed that the participation in mammography screening in women aged 40 to 69 remains low 48.1%. Some limitations regarding access to early detection and diagnosis include economic strata, health insurance coverage, origin, and accessibility. On average, a 90-day period was reported from onset of symptoms to diagnosis of breast cancer.

Methods: We estimated disability adjusted life years (DALYs) attributable to chronic pain using Global Burden of Disease (GBD) method. We identified diagnostic codes related to chronic pain considering lumbar pain, osteoarthritis, post-herpetic neuralgia, diabetic neuropathy, cancer-related pain, and others. We estimated the prevalent cases by sex and age-group using local administrative databases and literature. We assumed that pain would not cause premature death, so we only estimated years lived with disability using disability weights obtained from the GBD. We used a prevalence-based approach, without discounting or age-group adjustment. We calculated total DALYs and DALYs/100,000 inhabitants. Results: We estimated a total of 5,545,019 patients with chronic pain. We calculated 491,626 DALYs or 976 DALYs/100,000 inhabitants attributable to chronic pain. Low back pain, osteoarthritis, and cancer-related pain were the most important groups. Conclusions: This study estimates that chronic pain contributes a significant quantity of DALYs, especially related to low back pain, osteoarthritis, and cancer-related pain.

In Colombia, HBP has a prevalence of 25% and a high mortality rate; however, the psychosocial factors that affect pharmacological adherence have not been sufficiently studied. Despite international evidence on psychosocial factors in adherence to adherence to hypertension, in Colombia there is a paucity of research on the role of chronic stress in the relationship between socioeconomic status (PSE) and pharmacological adherence. Objetive: To examine the role of chronic stress in the relationship between socioeconomic status and pharmacological adherence in hypertensive patients aged 45 to 70 years old in three Colombian cities. Materials and methods: A cross-sectional study was carried out in a population of hypertensive patients during 2015 to 2016. Data for this study came from the first wave of longitudinal study aims to examine social factors associated to the control of hypertension in Bogota, Medellin and Quibdo. Patients with hypertension were selected randomly from a sample of those that attended a hypertension control program. For the statistical analysis of the data we used factorial analysis and multivariate regressions. Results: We found a positive association of PSE with the measure of pharmacological adherence and negative with chronic stress. In addition, evidence was found that stress has a negative association with the measure of adherence. Conclusions: The results suggest that stress is not a likely mediator between PSE and the pharmacological adherence of hypertensive patients in Colombia.

Nevertheless, there is insufficient evidence to support the use of other strategies. Recent research has shown that the use of computerized decision support presents a promising approach to address some aspects of this problem. Objective: The aim of this study is to provide qualitative evidence on the potential effect of mobile decision support systems to facilitate the implementation of evidence-based recommendations included in clinical practice guidelines. Methods: We will conduct a qualitative study with two arms to compare the experience of primary care physicians while they try to implement an evidence-based recommendation in their clinical practice. In the first arm, we will provide participants with a printout of the guideline article containing the recommendation, while in the second arm, we will provide participants with a mobile app developed after formalizing the recommendation text into a clinical algorithm. Data will be collected using semistructured and open interviews to explore aspects of behavioral change and technology acceptance involved in the implementation process. The analysis will be comprised of two phases. During the first phase, we will conduct a template analysis to identify barriers and facilitators in each scenario. Then, during the second phase, we will contrast the findings from each arm to propose hypotheses about the potential impact of the system. Results: We have formalized the narrative in the recommendation into a clinical algorithm and have developed a mobile app. Data collection is expected to occur during 2018, with the first phase of analysis running in parallel. The second phase is scheduled to conclude in July 2019.

Methods: We developed a Markov discrete-time, compartmental, deterministic model stratified by Colombian departments, healthcare workers, comorbidities, and age groups and calibrated to seroprevalence, cases, and deaths. The model simulates three scenarios: no vaccination, no prioritization of vaccination, and prioritization of high-risk population. The study presents the perspective of the health system of Colombia, including the direct health costs financed by the government and the direct health outcomes related to the infection. We measured symptomatic cases, deaths, and costs for each of the three scenarios from the start of the vaccination rollout to February 20, 2023. Results: Both for the base-case and across multiple sensitivity analyses, the high-risk prioritization proves to be the most costeffective of the considered strategies. An increment of US$255 million results in an incremental cost-effectiveness ratio of US$3339 per disability-adjusted life-year avoided. The simulations show that prioritization of high-risk population reduces symptomatic cases by 3.4% and deaths by 20.1% compared with no vaccination. The no-prioritization strategy is still costeffective, with an incremental cost-effectiveness ratio of US$5223.66, but the sensitivity analysis the show potential risks of losing cost-effectiveness under the cost-effectiveness threshold (one gross domestic product per averted disability adjusted life-year).

Due to the lack of anti-COVID-19 therapies, decision-makers require timely and accurate data to estimate the incidence of disease and the availability of hospital resources to contain the pandemic. Methods: We adapted an existing model to the local context to forecast COVID-19 incidence and hospital resource use assuming different scenarios: (1) the implementation of quarantine from September 1st to October 15th (average daily growth rate of 2%); (2-3) partial restrictions (at 4% and 8% growth rates); and (4) no restrictions, assuming a 10% growth rate. Previous scenarios with predictions from June to August were also presented. We estimated the number of new cases, diagnostic tests required, and the number of available hospital and intensive care unit (ICU) beds (with and without ventilators) for each scenario. Results: We estimated 67,700 cases by October 15th when assuming the implementation of a quarantine, 80,400 and 101,500 cases when assuming partial restrictions at 4% and 8% infection rates, respectively, and 208,500 with no restrictions. According to different scenarios, the estimated demand for reverse transcription-polymerase chain reaction tests ranged from 202,000 to 1,610,600 between September 1st and October 15th. The model predicted depletion of hospital and ICU beds by September 20th if all restrictions were to be lifted and the infection growth rate increased to 10%. Conclusion: Slowly lifting social distancing restrictions and reopening the economy is not expected to result in full resource depletion by October if the daily growth rate is maintained below 8%.

Regarding these trajectories, it is observed that, although some municipalities have increased their level of competitiveness, in the vast majority of the country the level has remained stable and does not present much subnational variation, at the same time that it is identified that in a smaller number of municipalities it is decreasing. This result demonstrates that local competitiveness has had a heterogeneous development in relation to time and territory in Colombia. Based on this information, four case studies were carried out to identify in an exploratory way the causes that could explain the variation in competitiveness analyzed here.

This is a region rich in biodiversity and natural resources, which in the past was hit by violence and the actions of different armed groups. Benefit estimation takes into account diverse monetary valuation techniques, such as market prices for direct wetland uses and the transfer of benefits, for the assessment of indirect use and non-use values. The results reveal that the most important values relate to ecotourism (60.1%) as a possible future use of the CSW, the benefit of preventing flooding (28.4%), and the biodiversity that inhabits the area (6.7%). All three values represent the total economic value of the CSW. This research also finds that the benefits of the ecosystems currently provided by the CSW exceed the opportunity cost, represented by the total conversion of the area to livestock.

Colombia recognized orphan diseases as a problem of public health interest and ordered its mandatory notification. Objective: Describe the information on orphan-rare diseases obtained in Cali through SIVIGILA in the first 2 years of registration. Materials and methods: Analytical cross-sectional observational study. Absolute and relative frequendes were calculated. Normality analysis of Shapiro Wilk was performed. Prevalence was calculated. The relationship of different sociodemographic and clinical variables and mortality risk was evaluated, using Generalized Linear Models, the Poisson distribution family, Logarithmic link function and robust variance models. Results: 635 cases were notified. 78 in 2016 for a prevalence of 3,25 / 100.000 and 557 in 2017 for a prevalence of 23,01 / 100.000. Most cases belong to the tax system. The communes with the highest number of cases and the highest prevalence were 17 and 22. Among the first most common orphan-rare diseases, sickle cell disease was the most reported in Cali with 25 cases in 2016 (prevalence 1,04/100.000) and 77 cases in 2017 (prevalence 3,1/100.000). The estimated crude mortality rate for the study period was 0,83 / 100.000, and the diseases with the highest mortality were sickle cell disease in women (0,12 / 100.000) and polyneuropathy in men (0,13 / 100.000).

However, reservations arise about the consistency and coherence of this strategy. There exists a question about how the digitalization of the Colombian public sector affects and is affected by the State's need to strengthen its physical presence in the territory.

We chose an ethnographic approach both to collect the life stories of 20 displaced adolescent mothers who had resettled in Bogota and to conduct eight workshops. The analysis shows that the participants struggled with their identities as 'women' in the rural areas in the context of violence and armed conflict when they faced motherhood while still being adolescent and becoming displaced and when they embraced the formal 'displaced person' identity while enduring difficulties with the receptor communities during resettlement.

The envenomation by this snake is mainly characterized by neurotoxicity and the main toxin is crotoxin (similar to 64.7% of the total venom). The Instituto Nacional de Salud (INS) produces a polyvalent antivenom aimed at the treatment of bothropic, crotalid, and lachesic envenomations; nonetheless, its immune reactivity profile and neutralizing capacity over biological activities of the C. d. cumanensis venom has been poorly evaluated. In this sense, the study aims: (1) to describe an in-depth exploration of its immunoreactivity through second-generation antivenomics and HPLC fraction-specific ELISA immunoprofiles; and (2) to evaluate the neutralization pattern of the rattlesnake venom in vitro and in vivo biological activities. The results obtained showed a variable recognition of crotoxin subunits, in addition to a molecular mass-dependent immunoreactivity pattern in which the disintegrins were not recognized, and snake venom metalloproteinases and L-amino acid oxidases were the most recognized. Additionally, a high neutralization of proteolytic and coagulant activities was observed, but not over the PLA(2) activity. Further, the median effective dose against C. d. cumanensis venom lethality was 962 mu L of antivenom per mg of venom. In conclusion, (1) the antivenom recognition over the crotoxin and the disintegrins of the C. d. cumanensis should be improved, thus aiming upcoming efforts for the exploration of new techniques and approaches in antivenom production in Colombia, and (2) the neutralization activity of the antivenom seems to follow the molecular mass-dependent recognition pattern, although other explanations should be explored.",Article,"Acosta-Pena, A.; Nunez, V.; Pereanez, J.A.; Rey-Suarez, P.",antivenomics; immune reactivity; Colombia; snakebite; antivenom therapy; Crotalus durissus cumanensis,antivenomics;immune reactivity;Colombia;snakebite;antivenom therapy;Crotalus durissus cumanensis;SNAKE VENOMICS;BIOLOGICAL CHARACTERIZATION;ONTOGENIC VARIABILITY;AMERICAN ANTIVENOMS;CROSS-REACTIVITY;CROTOXIN COMPLEX;BOTHROPS-ATROX;LACHESIS-MUTA;ASSAY;POLYVALENT,Colombia;Chile,2-s2.0-85127962665

The impact of the indwelling urinary catheter on etiologic agents and clinical outcomes has been poorly studied in Latin America. Methods: Cross-sectional study including patients with cUTI, with positive urine culture, treated at Hospital Universitario San Ignacio, Bogotá (Colombia) between 2017 and 2020. Clinical and microbiologic characteristics, treatments and outcomes are explored, comparing those with and without indwelling urinary catheter. Results: Seven hundred thirty-five patients with non-catheter-associated cUTI (NC-cUTI) and 165 with catheter-associated cUTI (CAUTI) were included. CAUTI group had a higher proportion of recurrent UTI (18% vs 33.3%, p < 0.001), ICU requirement (2.7% vs 8.5%, p < 0.001), longer hospital stay (6 vs 10 days, p < 0.001) and > 30 days unplanned readmission rate (5.8% vs 10.3%, p < 0.001). In the same group, we found a higher frequency of Pseudomonas spp (2.6% vs 9.4%, p < 0.001), Enterococcus spp. (2.4% vs 3.3%, p = 0.016), Serratia marcescens (0.6% vs 3.3%, p < 0.001) and Citrobacter freundii (0.5% vs 5.7%, p < 0.001).

The aim was to establish the ways masculinities are expressed and recreated by motorcycle riders and the importance of motorcycles in these expressions. To do this, semistructured interviews were conducted to search for the evolution of their personal stories as men and on their relationship with motorcycles. We found that their masculinities are currently ""in transit"": they vary from hegemonic manifestations to peripheral masculine ways of expression. Evidence of these transits can be grouped around four emerging categories: risk behavior, amusement settings, sexual expression and roles in public and private settings. Results show that, in some of these categories, the hegemonic patriarchal masculine logic prevails, especially through risky behaviors and motorcycle riding. However, other disruptive ways of expressing masculinities were found, motivated by the social transformations in equality policies, changes in interpersonal relationships and the participants' own experiences.

Colombia has legislation regarding provision of and access to palliative care and is the only Latin American country with regulation regarding euthanasia. We describe medical end-of-life decision-making practices among cancer patients in three Colombian hospitals. Methods Cancer patients who were at the end-of-life and attended in participating hospitals were identified. When these patients deceased, their attending physician was invited to participate. Attending physicians of 261 cancer patients (out of 348 identified) accepted the invitation and answered a questionnaire regarding end-of-life decisions: a.) decisions regarding the withdrawal or withholding of potentially life-prolonging medical treatments, b.) intensifying measures to alleviate pain or other symptoms with hastening of death as a potential side effect, and c.) the administration, supply or prescription of drugs with an explicit intention to hasten death. For each question addressing the first two decision types, we asked if the decision was fully or partially made with the intention or consideration that it may hasten the patient's death. Results Decisions to withdraw potentially life-prolonging treatment were made for 112 (43%) patients, 16 of them (14%) with an intention to hasten death. For 198 patients (76%) there had been some decision to not initiate potentially life-prolonging treatment. Twenty-three percent of patients received palliative sedation, 97% of all patients received opioids. Six patients (2%) explicitly requested to actively hasten their death, for two of them their wish was fulfilled. In another six patients, medications were used with the explicit intention to hasten death without their explicit request. In 44% (n = 114) of all cases, physicians did not know if their patient had any advance care directives, 26% (n = 38) of physicians had spoken to the patient regarding the possibility of certain treatment decisions to hasten death where this applied. Conclusions Decisions concerning the end of life were common for patients with cancer in three Colombian hospitals, including euthanasia and palliative sedation.

This study describes the results of a survey of Colombian psychiatrists on some aspects of medicinal cannabis, such as attitudes towards its potential use, perceived knowledge, and beliefs surrounding its regulation and safety. Methods We conducted a cross-sectional survey of 145 psychiatrists in 14 territories of Colombia between November 2019 and July 2020. The survey consisted of 28 items on topics related to medicinal cannabis, including attitudes and clinical experience (4 items), perceived knowledge (4 items), indications for use in psychiatric pathologies (6 items), indications for use in nonpsychiatric pathologies (8 items), and concerns and awareness about safety and efficacy (6 items). The results were summarized using descriptive statistics. In addition, possible associations among variables were examined using Fisher's exact test. Results Eighty-two percent of the psychiatrists agreed that medical cannabis should be available for different medical conditions, and 73.1% stated that they wanted to be able to prescribe it. However, 66.2% said they did not know how to help their patients legally access it, and only 25% understood the legal status of medicinal cannabis in the country. The mental health indications that received the highest approval levels for cannabis use were insomnia (35.2%), anxiety disorders (29%), and agitation in dementia (18.6%). The greatest disapproval of cannabis use was indicated for schizophrenia, with 66.9%. The most approved nonpsychiatric medical conditions were cancer-related chronic pain (87.6%), chemotherapy-related nausea and vomiting (78.6%), and chronic pain not associated with cancer (72.4%). Multinomial stepwise logistic regression analysis showed that female psychiatrists who did not agree with MC to treat psychiatric symptoms were more likely to agree with non-psychiatric use. Conclusions Our results showed that this sample of Colombian psychiatrists have a favorable attitude towards the prescription of medicinal cannabis; however, there is a serious lack of knowledge of the legal status of medicinal cannabis in the country and the methods through which patients can gain access to government-regulated products.

Societies that make the transition from conflict to peace need to seek truth, justice, and reparation concerning massive and systematic violations. Thus truth, history, and historical memory (HM) are central to reconciliation and play a key role in fulfilling the national and international obligations of the state. HM in Colombia has emerged mainly from the voices of victims, generating a narrative of events in which the discourses of members of the Armed Forces has, by and large, tended either to be out of place, or is regarded as the perpetrators' account. Military personnel have usually been perceived to be offenders or perpetrators; finding the ""truth"" based on narratives of traumatic events is complex. This research contributes to the debate on HM in Colombia and the right to truth, exploring the narratives and emotions of traumatized soldiers who suffered permanent physical injuries, and presenting the results of an interdisciplinary project conducted via a series of in-depth interviews.

Despite a decrease in overall children's stunting in the last decades, there are still significant geographic disparities between urban and rural areas in Colombia. This paper aims to identify the role of the main determinants of children's stunting in explaining the urban-rural stunting gap. We use data from the 2015 National Nutritional Situation Survey (the most recent available dataset) and the Yun's statistical decomposition technique. We find that the urban-rural gap in child stunting is 7.2 percentage points. Three determinants: household wealth, maternal education, and health services utilization, explain most of the gap (92%). Each determinant explains 54%, 26%, and 12% of the characteristics effect, respectively.

These fisheries remain poorly characterized, making it difficult to estimate their potential impact, especially on non-targeted catch such as elasmobranchs. A rapid assessment framework was used to investigate the exploitation, use, and relative abundance of elasmobranchs and predatory teleosts in a region along the Caribbean coast of Colombia. In-person structured interview surveys (n = 188) were conducted during the autumn of 2016 at eight fishing towns around Cartagena and the islands of the Natural National Park (NNP) Corales del Rosario and San Bernardo. Baited remote underwater video systems (BRUVS) (n = 200) deployed at four reefs were used to assess the relative abundance of elasmobranchs and other predatory teleosts. Fishers reported capturing eight shark and five ray taxa. Although 99% of fishers indicated that they did not target sharks, 83% reported keeping the catches to sell, eat, or both. Similarly, 81% of fishers did not target rays, but 90% reported retaining catches. Most fishers (84%) perceived a decline of sharks in the coastal waters since they started fishing, compared with 41% reporting batoid declines. BRUVS data support the perceptions of elasmobranch declines. Elasmobranch abundances were very low and no difference was detected between protected and unprotected reefs. Results were similar for teleost taxa, but there were higher abundances inside one marine protected area (MPA) that had high enforcement. Taken together, the data suggest considerable degradation of not only elasmobranch populations but also predatory fish populations of coral reef habitats in a region of the Colombian Caribbean. Furthermore, artisanal fishers continue to exploit coral reef resources inside MPAs unless there is strong enforcement. Enforcement can be difficult with limited resources, and therefore community-based conservation methods may be more effective. Engagement with the local fishing community may help to reduce existing tensions and improve compliance.",Article,"Unknown.; Kiszka, Jeremy J.; Luna-Acosta, Andrea.; Unknown.; Unknown.; Unknown",artisanal fisheries;BRUVS;Caribbean;Colombia;elasmobranchs;interview surveys;reef fish,artisanal fisheries;BRUVS;Caribbean;Colombia;elasmobranchs;interview surveys;reef fish,Colombia;Colombia;United States;Colombia,

Psychosocial rehabilitation is a Victims Law's reparation measure whose objective is to re-establish the psychosocial, physical and mental health welfare in the individual, familiar and community levels. This study aims to understand the experiences of psychosocial rehabilitation of women victims of armed conflict in Montes de Maria and the underlying social intervention paradigms that guide the Law's implementation. Methods Based on a qualitative design with a phenomenological approach, narrative tools and thematic network analysis permitted to give voice to the women participants. Individual narrative interviews were conducted with 12 women victims and a focus group with eight of them was used as a triangulation strategy. Results Although the Victims Law is oriented by a sociopolitical intervention paradigm, the stories of the women's victims of Montes de Maria mainly evidenced non-sociopolitical interventions with humanitarian assistance towards revictimization and State abandonment. As a coping mechanism towards the State negligence encountered, women strive to overcome psychosocial trauma by developing agency and community resources for the resignification of the traumatic experiences and peacebuilding. Conclusions For the Victims Law to achieve its integrality aim, the psychosocial approach should be implemented through all its measures but remains absent in Montes de Maria. The diversity of victim's individual and collective initiatives that were found, can contribute towards transformative and participatory psychosocial intervention with community's resources. Women victims can perform as advisors and collaborators in the implementation of individual and collective reparation, which remains as an opportunity for psychosocial rehabilitation and peacebuilding. Further monitoring and evaluation of the law with a territorial and differential perspective is required to respond to the victim's needs.",Article,"Sarmiento-Marulanda, L.C.; Aguilera-Char, A.A.; Gonzalez-Gil, C.; Lopez-Lopez, W.",Psychosocial; armed conflict; Social intervention; Social policy; Victims; Integral reparation; Colombia,Psychosocial;armed conflict;Social intervention;Social policy;Victims;Integral reparation;Colombia,Colombia,2-s2.0-85102341181

Data were collected in a parallel manner between June and October 2011. We conducted 19 semi-structured interviews with researchers of Colombian universities that have been central actors in the QR nursing in Colombia and we reviewed 159 documents published by Colombian nursing researchers between 1990 and 2010 mainly in Colombian and Latin American journals. The interpretative analysis that we present include the following themes: the beginnings of QR in nursing in Colombia; the topics, approaches and populations; and finally, the contributions, limitations, and challenges for the future. Through their practice on QR Colombian nurses have raised criticisms of the hegemonic positivist and biologists models of health research studies; they have conducted research studies with various individuals and population groups; they have used different approaches and methods such as ethnography, phenomenology, grounded theory, among the ones with higher frequency; they have had limitations related to the quality and rigor, lack of recognition, lack of time, and difficulties in funding and publications.

This characterization allows prioritizing populations with specific risks, programming the use of health services, and planning the costs necessary to guarantee equitable care. Objective To assess the demographic and clinical characteristics of a cohort of patients with rheumatoid arthritis using national data collected by the High-Cost Disease Fund (CAC in Spanish). Methods A cross-sectional study from a secondary source. Data was gathered from a national administrative registry. A descriptive analysis was performed on sociodemographic and clinical characteristics. Age-standardized prevalence was estimated at national level and by geographical regions. Remission rates were also estimated for Colombian departments and regions. Results By 2019, 81,386 patients with rheumatoid arthritis were reported in Colombia. The relation female-male was 5.2:1. The median age was 59 years (IQR: 50-67). Prevalence was higher in people aged 50-69 years. The most frequent comorbidities were high blood pressure (31.15%) and osteoporosis (19.46%). Age-standardized prevalence of rheumatoid arthritis was 0.24 per 100 population (95% CI: 0.23-0.24). In cases with complete information, 57.57% of departments had remission rates up to 30%.

During 2007, the mortality due to road traffic accidents in children under the age of five was 11.7 per 100,000 in Colombia. Objective: To describe the trend of road traffic deaths in children under the age of five in Colombia from 2005 to 2009. Materials and methods: We conducted a cross-sectional study of death certificates in children under the age of five as registered in the official vital statistics records from 2005 to 2009 (ICD-10, codes V000-V999). We made a descriptive analysis, calculated mortality rates based on projections by the National Administrative Statistics Department and we established risk levels by provinces and municipalities (percentiles), as well as by conglomerates using Excel (R), PASW statistics18 (R) and Epilnfo (R) for the maps. Results: All in all, 713 road traffic deaths occurred from 2005 to 2009 in children under the age of five corresponding to 0.8% of total deaths in that age group. The total number of road traffic deaths decreased from 2005 (159 deaths) to 2009 (136 deaths). The mean national death rate due to road traffic accidents was 3.3 per 100,000 with a higher rate among one to four year-old children (3.5/100,000) compared to children under the age of one (2.6/100,000). The highest prevalence of road traffic deaths was observed in January (9.7%) and July (10.6%).

Based on these, an ostomy seems to compromise three individual aspects: physical, emotional and social. The physical aspect is associated with the mechanical difficulties caused by the ostomy, such as the act of coitus. The emotional aspect is related to self-esteem alterations due to changes in an individual's physical appearance. Lastly, the social aspect is related to the perception of their partner, their family and other peers. The sexuality of people with ostomies should be approached before and after the surgery.

After that, and under the Decree 281 of 18 March 2021 issued by the Ministry of Environment of Colombia, a new policy (called the Environmental Plan for the protection and conservation of sharks, marine rays, and chimaeras of Colombia)emerged, and the management duty of Chondrichthyans changed from a fishery resource to a hydrobiological resource, thereby prohibiting commercial use of those species and transferring its management to the government's environmental sector. This paper discusses the two policy instruments created for the same group of fishes, the consequences of changing the government management duty from one sector to another by the new policy created, and the implications for the environmental, fisheries, control, and surveillance sectors, civil organizations, and even for sharks. In addition, a logical framework analysis method was carried out to identify shark vulnerability and stakeholders, and to analyze both policy instruments and their positive and negative outputs. Part of the environmental sector celebrated the issued decree as an unprecedented achievement for Colombia. In contrast, other stakeholders, including the fisheries sector, declared that the ban on sharks/batoids for trade and fishing indirectly affects marine fisheries and fishers since these species are commonly bycatch in most of them. Consequently, shark/batoid bycatch management was raised as the central management issue since fishing activity is the main threat for elasmobranchs. Alternatives are proposed for conservation and fisheries to coexist, obtaining mutual benefits, avoiding confrontation, and heading towards sustainable development from different perspectives.",Article,"Unknown.; Unknown.; Unknown.; Manjarres-Martinez, Luis M.; Unknown.; Unknown.; Unknown.; Unknown.; Unknown.; Unknown.; Unknown.; Unknown",Batoids;Colombia;Environmental management;Fisheries management;Sharks,Batoids;Colombia;Environmental management;Fisheries management;Sharks,Ireland;Colombia;Colombia;Colombia;United States;Colombia;Colombia;Colombia;Colombia;Colombia;Colombia;Colombia;Colombia,

By the end of September of that year, the flu was present in Colombia, the first cases having emerged in the city of Bogota, from where it spread to the surrounding municipalities, and later to much of the national territory. As was the case elsewhere in the world, the epidemic presented a severe clinical picture and claimed many lives, especially in the higher altitude and colder areas. Hospitals, departmental governments, public charities and doctors faced the disease in the midst of a great deal of uneasiness that manifested itself in three major concerns: establishing the route followed by the epidemic to reach Bogota, establishing the flu's causal agents, and how to deal with the disconcerting mortality and social drama generated by the epidemic.

This study sought to characterise the profile of social media users, among primary care patients in Colombia, and to assess predictors of their use of social media to search for health and mental health information (searching behaviour). Methods: As part of a larger scale-up study, we surveyed 1,580 patients across six primary care sites in Colombia about their social media use. We used chi-square and Student's t-tests to assess associations between demographic variables, social media use and searching behaviour, and a Chi-square Automatic Interaction Detector (CHAID) analysis to determine predictors of searching behaviour. Results: In total, 44.4% of respondents reported that they were social media users. Of these, 35.7% used social media to search for health-related information and 6.6% used it to search for mental health-related information. While the profile of individuals who used social media to search for health-related information was similar to that of general social media users (the highest use was among women living in urban areas), the presence of mental health symptoms was a more important predictor of using social media to search for mental health-related information than demographic variables. Individuals with moderate-severe symptoms of anxiety reported a significantly higher percentage of searching than individuals without symptoms (12.5% vs. 5.2%). Conclusions: Given that some individuals with mental health disorders turn to social media to understand their illness, social media could be a successful medium for delivering mental health interventions in Colombia.",Article,"Bartels, S.

Method: Single-stage descriptive correlational cross-sectional design. An anonymous online questionnaire was administered to 100 Colombian trans women. The results were obtained using both frequentist and bayesian (a priori-a posteriori) statistical methods. Results: About three-quarters of the participating women reported a high level of adherence to preventive behaviors. Associated factors were feeling able to implement the preventive actions and believing in their effectiveness, to avoid infecting others, conflicts with others, and avoiding legal problems. Conclusions: Self-efficacy and rule-governed behaviors are related to adherence to prevention measures. Addressing adherence in times of COVID-19 implies comprehensively incorporating the magnitude of social inequities and injustices and the health responses to a situation that affects humanity in a diverse and differentiated manner.

Policy and development implications,"The Amazon basin is one of the most extensive, biodiverse, and dynamic tropical forest ecosystems on the earth. The Colombian Amazon basin occupies an area of approx. 34 million hectares, located in the country's southeast. The literature about the economic valuation of ecosystem services (ES) and the spatial information on remnant natural resources in the Colombian Amazon basin was revised through various information sources to document the earliest approximation to the state, spatial distribution, and economic value of the remnant natural capital at the scale of biomes, specific ecosystems, and political-administrative units. Our assessment estimated a natural capital loss of 18.1 billion $/year (equivalent to 6.7% of Colombian GDP in 2020) and a remnant natural capital worth 153.9 billion $/year (57% of Colombia's GDP in 2020) for eight ecosystem services. This research founds that a potential expansion in extensive and intensive livestock production systems (in a ten-year projection) will generate an additional loss of remnant natural capital of approximately 9.1 billion $/year. Finally, considering that 63% of the remnant natural capital is represented in indigenous reservations and 28% in protected areas, it is essential that the political management of the Amazon Basin concentrate on strengthening these land management figures. Improving the governability of indigenous lands and incentive sustainable agricultural and cattle ranching production, are the principal political challenges.",Article,"Unknown.; Gutierrez-Bonilla, Francisco de Paula.; Cortes-Gomez, Angela Maria.; Suarez, Andres",Amazon basin;Colombia;Economic values;Ecosystem services;Remnant natural capital;Spatial models,Amazon basin;Colombia;Economic values;Ecosystem services;Remnant natural capital;Spatial models,Colombia;Colombia;Colombia,

Therefore, the aim of this work is to describe, for the first time, the population structure regarding dwarf lanternshark in the Colombian Caribbean Sea. During deep-water research surveys conducted along the Colombian Caribbean coast, 87 stations were sampled using the swept area method. A total of 153 dwarf lanternshark individuals were caught in depths ranging from 230 to 530 m. This information was used to describe the size structures, morphological measurements including length-at-weight relationship, length at maturity in females and the spatial distribution of mean length and biomass of the species. The lengths of individuals ranged from 78.02 to 289.00 mm total length (TL), which is a new record of maximum length for this species. The spatial distribution of mean lengths and biomass distributions show high abundances and high relative mean lengths in the northeast area off Santa Marta and the area northwest of Riohacha. The mean biomass density in the whole prospected area was 5.52 kg km(-2). Length at 50% maturity in females was estimated in 203 mm TL (95% C.I.: 190-214 mm). Deep-water elasmobranch species, such as the dwarf lantern shark, are expected to show extremely low resilience to fishing exploitation, even when they are not targeted by commercial fishing. Therefore, the information reported in this study can serve as a baseline upon which management measurements can be proposed for the conservation of this shark species.",Article,"Paramo, J.; Wiff, R.; Gonzlez, R.",Caribbean; Colombia; dwarf lanternshark; elasmobranch; endemism; Etmopterus perryi; spatial distribution,Caribbean;Colombia;dwarf lanternshark;elasmobranch;endemism;Etmopterus perryi;spatial distribution;SEA;MATURITY;FISHES;SPINAX;CHONDRICHTHYES;HABITAT;BIOLOGY;LENGTH,Colombia;Chile,2-s2.0-85105165578

However, obtaining average values are more straightforward than the high temporal resolution information necessary to catch the extreme events on those tails. Such information is difficult to get in areas lacking sufficient rain stations. Thanks to the development of Satellite Precipitation Estimates with a daily resolution, this problem has been overcome, so Extreme Precipitation Indices (EPI) can be calculated for the entire Colombian territory. However, Colombia is strongly affected by the ENSO (El Nino-Southern Oscillation) phenomenon. Therefore, it is pertinent to ask if the EPI's long-term change due to climate change is more critical than the anomalies due to climate variability induced by the warm and cold phases of ENSO (El Nino and La Nina, respectively). In this work, we built EPI annual time series at each grid-point of the selected Satellite Precipitation Estimate (CHIRPSv2) over Colombia to answer the previous question. Then, the Mann-Whitney-Wilcoxon test was used to compare the samples drawn in each case (i.e., change tests due to both long-term and climatic variability). After performing the analyses, we realized that the importance of the change depends on the region analyzed and the considered EPI. However, some general conclusions became evident: during El Nino years (La Nina), EPI's anomaly follows the general trend of reduction -drier conditions- (increase; -wetter conditions-) observed in Colombian annual precipitation amount, but only on the Pacific, the Caribbean, and the Andean region. In the Eastern plains of Colombia (Orinoquia and Amazonian region), EPI show a certain insensitivity to change due to climatic variability. On the other hand, EPI's long-term changes in the Pacific, the Caribbean, and the Andean region are spatially scattered. Still, long-term changes in the eastern plains have a moderate spatial consistency with statistical significance.",Article,"Giraldo-Osorio, J.D.; Trujillo-Osorio, D.E.; Baez-Villanueva, O.M.",Colombia; Extreme Precipitation Index (EPI); long-term change; climate change; climate variability; Satellite Precipitation Estimate (SPE); CHIRPS; Mann-Whitney-Wilcoxon test; trend analysis,Colombia;Extreme Precipitation Index (EPI);long-term change;climate change;climate variability;Satellite Precipitation Estimate (SPE);CHIRPS;Mann-Whitney-Wilcoxon test;trend analysis;SOUTHERN-OSCILLATION;FLOOD RISK;TEMPERATURE;EVENTS;CLIMATE;EXTENSION;AMERICA;IMPACT,Colombia;Germany,2-s2.0-85131523515

The case is also suggested for subjects associated with the organizational dynamics on SMEs. Case overview: Colchones Eldorado is a Colombian company dedicated to the bedding industry. The company was founded in 1957 by Gumercindo Gómez Caro, a creative man who in 1959 invented a machine to make springs, which allowed the company to grow steadily for several decades. On November 18, 2004, the founder's daughter, Martha Luz Gomez, was appointed as General Manager. On April 2011 it obtained a license from Sealy, the biggest mattress making company in the USA. The license implied a challenge - testing the company's innovative capacities to adapt Sealy mattresses to satisfy consumers in the Colombian market. Expected learning outcomes: Students are shown the characteristics of the creative and innovation process in a Latin American SME, and the innovation challenges which are faced. From the reading and the case discussion, the students should be able to: analyse the manifestations of the creative process in an SME; identify examples of the innovation types of an SME; and discuss the organizational conditions to answer the creativity and innovation challenges in an SME.

The Colombian State has dealt with these impacts through collective reparation; namely, a set of strategies aimed at reconstructing the collective meaning of communities, organizations and groups that have faced the systematic violation of their rights. Given its (collective) nature, reparation makes possible the generation of spaces and forms of social cooperation aimed at the symbolic and material reproduction of life, that is, of processes of production of the common.

Likewise, Colombia’s strategy of signing Free Trade Agreements (FTAs) has been unfocused, inasmuch as trade policy has remained disjointed from productive transformation and development aims, which has, in turn, contributed to reprimarization of the country’s productive and export structure. The dispersal of both strategies has generated a precarious international economic insertion for Colombia, particularly on its impact on economic development.

The cost of these technologies plays a very important role when making therapeutic decisions. Therefore, we consider it relevant to estimate the cost-effectiveness of percutaneous nephrolithotomy compared with flexible retrograde holmium laser nephrolithotomy in patients with kidney stones of 20 mm to 30 mm in Colombia. Materials and Methods Through the development of a decision tree model using the Treeage (TreeAge Software, LLC, Williamstown, MA, US) software, we compared percutaneous nephrolithotomy with flexible holmium laser retrograde nephrolithotomy in patients with kidney stones of 20 mm to 30 mm. The perspective was that of the third payer, and all direct costs were included. The figures were expressed in terms of 2018 Colombian pesos. Clinical improvement, which was defined as a stone-free patient, was the outcome unit. We extracted data on effectiveness and safety through a systematic review of the literature. The incremental cost-effectiveness ratio was calculated. Results In terms of cost-effectiveness the final model indicates that percutaneous nephrolithotomy may be considered the best alternative. These findings were sensitive to the probability of clinical improvement of the percutaneous nephrolithotomy. Conclusion Taking into account the economic variables, the assumptions of the model, and through the perspective of the third payer, percutaneous nephrolithotomy for the treatment of patients with kidney stones of 20 mm to 30mm is cost-effective in our country.

Mixed study: Qualitative and quantitative","Objective: To compare the level of implementation of the Extreme Maternal Morbidity Surveillance Model (EMMSM). and the main barriers and facilitators to the implementation in two groups of Healthcare Service Providers (HSP) in Colombia. Materials and methods: Mixed study using quantitative (semi-structured tool) and qualitative (In-depth interview) information techniques. The healthcare service providers in which the pilot model was implemented (pHSP) were compared with another group of healthcare institutions that did not participate in the initial implementation, hereinafter called control HSP (cHSP). They were are all selected jointly with the Ministry of Health (MoH) based on convenience. The level of implementation is presented in terms of proportions for each healthcare institution. The information was crossed-referenced in order to supplement the data of the various components of the EMMSM implementation. Results: Differences in implementation were found for each IPS group. In the IPSP there was greater dissemination of the protocols, detection, notification, information flows and decision-making. In the IPSC group there were more difficulties in determining main causes, defining avoidability criteria, and identifying delays. The numbers of professional staff, mean monthly hours and profiles were higher among the IPSP when compared with the IPSC. The level of implementation among the healthcare providers in the IPSP group ranged between 73 % and 94 %, and between 41 % and 90 % in the IPSC group. There was greater clarity among the IPSP regarding the role of the MVMME as a tool for quality improvement in care provided to pregnant women. Among the IPSC, although the model was considered a means to improve quality, it was perceived as work overload.

AN ANALYSIS BEYOND POLITICAL PARTIES,"This article proposes and identifies a new type of hybrid regime at the subnational level: electoral domains. These correspond to departments where a political structure has managed to maintain governorships in several elections, minimizing thus the opportunity for opposition forces to come to power, which, despite having a dominant political position, do not develop subnational authoritarianism at the departmental level. Therefore, this article has three objectives: to describe the concept of electoral domain, identify electoral domains in Colombia, and explain in an exploratory way the causes of its continuity or its end, as well as its implications for subnational democracy. Based on a mixed approach, using archival work, inferential models, and case studies, the research identified that electoral domains have been present differently in most departments in Colombia. It also demonstrated that the support of private subnational resources from their political structures and national influence via congressional positions are the main causes that allow its continuity or might explain its end.",Article,"Unknown.; Uribe, Juan Federico Pino",Colombia;Electoral domains;Hybrid regimes;Subnational democracy,Colombia;Electoral domains;Hybrid regimes;Subnational democracy,Ecuador;Colombia,

Based on it, an attempt is made to stablish when the Special Jurisdiction for Peace (JEP) can judge businessmen, since the Peace Agreement signed by the Colombian Government and the guerrilla group FARC-EP refers, somehow vaguely, to the “determining participation” of civilians in the crimes, as a standard to decide this point. Taking into consideration some relevant decisions for the development of the international criminal law, this article argues that the concept of complicity offers an appropriate framework for imputation in those cases.

As the use of these two methods has not been the object of a comparative study based on concrete experiences, this article presents them through four cases of Christian communities in Colombia. This comparative study not only illustrates the differences between these two methods of Bible reading, but also shows how they open new hermeneutic and liberation perspectives in the struggle for social justice and the search for reconciliation. The article depicts the CBR of the story of the Levite's concubine (Jdg 19:1-30) by a group of women living in vulnerable conditions as well as the CBR of the parable of the father and his two sons (Lk 15:11-32) by a group of violence victims' relatives. It also depicts the IBR of the story of the widow and the judge (Lk 18:1-8) by four groups of Caribbean readers as well as the IBR of the garden story (Gn 2:4b-25) by two Andean indigenous groups. Ordinary readers' central role as interpreters of biblical texts let them recognise their own capabilities to transform their contexts in an emancipatory way and challenge biblical scholars and theologians. Even though CBR and IBR pursue different hermeneutical goals, they converge in giving a central role to the community as the subject of counter-hegemonic interpretations that open new horizons starting from reality and triggering liberation processes.

There are two strategies for its prevention: Universal prophylaxis, with valganciclovir for 90 days, and anticipated therapy, using weekly viral load surveillance, and therapy only if positive. Meta-analysis directly comparing both strategies have shown them to have similar effectiveness. Objective: To determine which strategy is more cost-effective in intermediate risk patients in Colombia. Materials and methods: We designed a third-party payer perspective decision tree, considering only direct medical costs in 2014 Colombian pesos (COP) (USD$ 1=COP$ 2,000) and a time horizon of one year. The target population was intermediate CMV risk patients (positive receptor). Transition probabilities were extracted from clinical studies, validated with a Delphi expert panel method; procedural costs were obtained from the ISS 2001 manual with a 33% increment based on the Consumer Price Index for 2014, while medication costs were obtained from the official Ministry of Health information system. Results: Universal prophylaxis with valganciclovir was dominant, with lower costs and less probability of infection. The average cost of the first year in anticipated therapy would be COP$ 30,961,290, whereas in the case of universal therapy the cost would be COP$ 29,967,834 (incremental cost of COP$ 993,456).

As in previous studies, the Santa Cruz and Tree Line rearrangements were predominant in these populations, but for the first time other rearrangements such as the Olympic, Cuernavaca and a rearrangement similar to the endemic Mexican Amecameca rearrangement were also discovered. Researchers in the early 1960's showed that Colombian D. pseudoobscura populations were not in accordance with Carson's theory. They found a special heterotic system in this geographically isolated population. Our current results do not support these findings but instead favor Carson's theory, because in practically all the populations studied the homokaryotype excess was close to fixation. These new results indicate that some stabilizing selective pressures in favor of the homokaryotypes (especially Santa Cruz) have appeared in the Colombian plateau during the last 10-12 years. These new changes may be related to deforestation and habitat destruction by human beings and/or climatic changes motivated by the El Niño phenomenon. Genetic heterogeneity between populations was not significant and there was no isolation-by-distance between them, findings which are contrary to those observed in some North American populations and which show that the Colombian populations now have rigid genetic systems.

We found that the coconut fiber - biochar biomantle setup had a very positive impact on the development of the plants, show a promising alternative for future applications on soil ecological recovery. Understanding the development potential of a combined coverture with coconut fiber and biochar is a topic of key interest for the development and maintenance of sustainable infrastructure and the recovery of eroded areas in tropical countries such as Colombia.",Conference Paper,"Unknown.; Pineda, Jorge A.; Unknown",Biochar;Bioengineering;Biomantle;Colombia;Erosion,Biochar;Bioengineering;Biomantle;Colombia;Erosion,Colombia;Colombia;,

Evidence from two neotropical species,"Bergmann's rule is one of the most vigorously debated ecogeographic patterns but has rarely been examined in Neotropical bats. Herein, I examined Bergmann's rule in Carollia perspicillata and Artibeus lituratus along an elevation gradient of 2500 m at both inter- and intraspecific level. I measured 384 specimens from collections belonged to C. perspicillata (89 female, 102 male) and A. lituratus (89 female, 104 male). The size of C. perspicillata increased with increasing elevation and decreasing temperature, whereas A. lituratus showed the converse pattern. For both species, females did not differ between elevation categories, contrary to males that were larger above 1000 m in C. perspicillata, but smaller in A. lituratus. Conformity to Bergmann's rule depends on bat size and sex. Despite C. perspicillata follows the pattern, the explanatory mechanisms still need to be understood. By contrast, A. lituratus follows the converse of Bergmann's rule due to naked and highly vascularized wings that aid thermoregulation in warmer environments. Male size is more sensitive to changes in temperature for both species which may be partially explained by sexual selection.

For the year 2018, more than 53% of the world’s production of sugar cane was generated by countries in the Americas. Although Colombia is not among the top producing and exporting countries, it is important to highlight its high productivity per hectare. Given this singularity and the regional importance that this crop has in southwestern Colombia, this work aims to estimate a Cobb-Douglas production function for a plantation, divided into sub-plantations called suertes, located in the Tierradura village, Miranda Municipality, Department of Cauca, Colombia. To do this, we collected and classified historical information for each of the sub-plantations for the period 2003-2019. To conduct the estimation and considering the inaccuracy and bias problems of panel data models estimated by instrumental variables (IV) or by the generalized method of moments (GMM) when the number of observations is small, we proceeded to carry out the estimation using Least Squares with Corrected Dichotomous Variables. This is done using Stata’s xtlsdv command. This command allows the use of 3 possible options to correct the inconsistency: Anderson-Hsiao, Arellano-Bond, and Blundell-Bond, being the Arellano-Bond the most efficient option since it is supported by a greater number of internal instruments. The estimated results obtained by the Arellano-Bond method indicate, first, that the process can be described by a constant returns to scale production function and, second, that the number of hectares of cultivated land and total wages have the expected signs (0.778 and 0.067) and are statistically significant at 1% and 10%, respectively. Particularly, this means that if either the area of cultivated land or total wages is increased by 1%, sugarcane production would increase by 0.778% or 0.067%, correspondingly.",Article,"Mora, Jose U.; Unknown.; Unknown",Colombia;data panel;plantation;production function;Sugarcane;xtlsdv command,Colombia;data panel;plantation;production function;Sugarcane;xtlsdv command,Colombia,

,,,0,2-s2.0-84875539796,2012,"First Colombian consensus on digestive endoscopy ""agreement on fundamentals"" (First part: Formative aspects)","Purpose of the work. The practice of endoscopy in Colombia was modified when Resolution 1043 of 2006 authorized specialists in general surgery, internal medicine and pediatrics to perform endoscopy after completing one year of training in endoscopy at an institution of higher education. This, together with the development of relationships with different specialties within endoscopy, generated a disordered scenario which many considered to be unjust and unequal. Training requirements became differentiated. A world of tensions and interests among specialists, scientists, health care providers and service providers led to this consensus. Starting with fundamental agreements, it makes recommendations for unification of educational features that will allow endoscopic practices which aim for quality and whose central axis is the best interest of our patients. Materials and Methods. This consensus is a descriptive, cross-sectional social research study with a mixed approach (qualitative and quantitative) based on the Delphy method. The information in this study was obtained from the event titled ""Acuerdo en lo fundamental"" (agreement on fundamental issues) organized on June 23, 2012 by the president of the Colombian Association of Digestive Endoscopy (ACED). Qualitative data were taken from four roundtables discussions in which 34 participants discussed 25 survey questions. The quantitative data were taken from final voting and from an individual, private electronic survey. 75% or greater agreement was defined as consensus. Qualitative analysis employed discourse analysis oriented around five variables related to formative aspects. Basic descriptive statistics centered around percentages were used for quantitative analysis. Results. Participants in the consensus included 34 directors or representatives of 8 of the 9 graduate university programs with specialties in the digestive tract, former presidents of 11 scientific associations, professors of gastrointestinal endoscopy, the vice president of the Ibero-American Nurses Association, directors of institutes of endoscopy, teachers at institutes of endoscopy and four chiefs of graduate resident programs. Some issues upon which consensus was reached include: 81.9% agreed that endoscopy is not simply a diagnostic technique; 88.2% disagreed with one year training as recommended for gastrointestinal endoscopy with quality parameters; 100% underlined that training in endoscopy should take place within qualified and accredited university teaching; More than 84.9% did not recommend training general practitioners, nurses or medical technicians in endoscopy; 85.3% recommended 2-year programs for basic training in endoscopy with 1 to 2 years for advanced endoscopy. Conclusions. The Colombian consensus agrees that endoscopy is an element of support for both diagnostic and therapeutic practice. Training for quality endoscopy requires solid theoretical knowledge and skills, solid technical skills and knowledge and training in how to make ethical judgments. The basic requirement for training in gastrointestinal endoscopy should be that the student is enrolled in a clinical, surgical or pediatric gastroenterology subspecialty program. Responsibility for training in endoscopy should be in the hands of university professors and at well supported teaching hospitals and medical centers. The training time for basic endoscopy should be two years while advanced endoscopy requires at least another year and should be targeted towards a specific advanced field. © 2012 Asociaciones Colombianas de Gastroenterología, Endoscopia digestiva, Coloproctología y Hepatología.",Article,"Unknown.; Unknown.; Flores, Nadia Sofia.; Acosta, Alix Yineth Forero.; Canadas, Raul.; Unknown.; Unknown.; Unknown",Colombia;Digestive diseases;Endoscopy consensus;Endoscopy training;Quality of endoscopy,Colombia;Digestive diseases;Endoscopy consensus;Endoscopy training;Quality of endoscopy,Colombia;Colombia;Colombia;Colombia;Colombia;Colombia,

Ethics is always mentioned, but is little studied or investigated. The Colombian Association of Digestive Endoscopy (ACED) devotes the second part of the ""Fundamental Agreement"" consensus to the ethical practice of gastrointestinal endoscopy. We approach this topic from an analysis of the resolution of real dilemmas that arise in endoscopic scenarios shaping our practice. This is the way of conceptually appropriating ethical principles and moral values that should permeate the practice of specialists who rely on endoscopy. It is important to note that the end result is not intended to standardize the conduct of doctors. To the contrary, we propose to carry out an ongoing reflection about the continuous conflicts that arise in our specialty which should not be resolved without profound ethical and moral consideration. Materials and methods: This consensus is a social research study. It uses a descriptive and cross-sectional approach which mixes qualitative and quantitative analysis and is based on the Delphi Method. The information used was obtained during the ""Fundamental Agreement"" event held on June 23, 2012 by the Colombian Association of Digestive Endoscopy (ACED). Qualitative data were taken from four roundtable discussions in which the 34 participants discussed the 21 proposed ethical dilemmas. Quantitative data used include the final voting, individual private electronic surveys. Consensus was defined as agreement of 75% or more of participants. Speech analysis was used for qualitative analysis. It was oriented around from five variables related to moral and ethical aspects of the practice of endoscopy. For quantitative analysis, basic descriptive statistics centered on percentages were used. Results: Some of the consensus obtained were: 80.65% agreed to consult with the group that they replace in a particular institution; 80.54% shared the opinion that the type of contract limited research, educational, institutional and even personal development; 78.12% agreed that recognition of group work prevails over recognition of individual work in intellectual production, 100% agreed every individual involved in writing and publication should receive individual credit for their work; 80.64% agreed that the relationship of the patient to the health system determined the kind of attention that is given, and 90.82% agreed that the quality of care was affected by the number of patients who require care. Conclusions: The Colombian consensus agrees that resolution of ethical dilemmas that arise in real-world scenarios in the practice of endoscopy should consider ethical and moral values specifically related to the particular situation faced by the specialist. Thus, conflicts related to contractual or employment issues have to consider the dignity of, and respect for, colleagues. Similarly, equality and justice as values and principles that prevail within these scenarios must be considered. Intellectual property rights require responsibility and honesty as guiding principles when situations of group or individual recognition are confronted. Endoscopists' professional relationships with patients should be framed within values and ethics including prudence, humanity, truthfulness, and choosing the lesser evil. In turn, the specialist's relations with her or his team should respect collegiality, autonomy, the right to an individual's good name, dignity and equality. A culture that promotes ethics, responsibility, humanity and charity must prevail for ethical training. © 2013 Asociaciones Colombianas de Gastroenterología, Endoscopia digestiva, Coloproctología y Hepatología.",Article,"Unknown.; Martin, Diego Aponte.; Acosta, Alix Yineth Forero.; Flores, Nadia Sofia.; Canadas, Raul.; Unknown.; Unknown.; Unknown",Colombia;Consensus on endoscopy;Ethical principles;Ethics in gastroenterology and endoscopy;Medical ethics;Moral values;Training in ethics,Colombia;Consensus on endoscopy;Ethical principles;Ethics in gastroenterology and endoscopy;Medical ethics;Moral values;Training in ethics,Colombia;Colombia;Colombia;Colombia;Colombia;Colombia,

Methodology: direct observations were made in the field in the distribution areas of the different subspecies of H. hecalesia in Colombia. To compare the different morphotypes, genetic crossings were carried out in greenhouse conditions between the populations of H. hecalesia hecalesia from the middle Magdalena river, with the populations of H. hecalesia longarena from the Choco biogeographic region in western Colombia. Result: the genetic crosses of the different phenotypes obtained from the same parental crossing and backcrosses are illustrated and discussed, of which it was possible to reconstruct the gynaesia and ernestus forms, which are consistent with the pattern of coloration to the type specimens. All the phenotypes studied are involved in a new mimetic complex with Tithorea tarricina and Neruda godmani, which is described in this article. The reproductive isolation of the populations of southwestern Colombia that is manifested by hybrid sterility and unfeasibility in artificial crosses, provides strong evidence and support for the recognition of H. longarena n. comb as a good species as part of this study.

Most BC risk variants had been identified in women of European and Asian ancestry, but genetic data for Hispanic women are scarce. Here, we investigate the association between six variants in miR binding sites and BC risk in Colombian women. Methods: We genotyped miR binding site variants in the BMPR1B, TGFBR1, IQGAP1, KRAS, SETD8 and RYR3 genes in 1022 BC cases and 1023 controls from the Colombian breast cancer case-control (Col-BCCC) study using matrix-assisted laser desorption/ionization time-of-flight mass spectrometry (MALDI-TOF MS). Multiple logistic regression and permutation techniques were applied to assess the association between genetic variants and BC risk.

The Ci??naga receives fresh water from rivers descending from the Sierra Nevada de Santa Marta. Changes in the water dynamics of these rivers since the early twentieth century have been causing serious social and ecological changes in the region. The Aracataca river is one of these rivers that showed a drastic change in its water availability. In this research we study the relation between cooperation and hydrological dynamics that shapes the water governance system in this basin. The study combines quantitative data obtained from the hydrological description and qualitative information derived from interviews and a role-playing game workshop, which was analyzed from a social-ecological perspective.

Previous literature has proved that there is an increase in altruism, impatience, and risk-seeking. However, it is unknown if regular citizens, not directly involved in the conflict, perceive such economic behavior in postconflict actors. We asked participants to report, relative to them, how Colombia's postconflict actors (ex-guerrillas, ex-paramilitaries, and victims) behave in different economic games (dictator game, lotteries, and inter-temporal discounting). Our sample of university students believes that victims are less altruistic than current evidence with real victims, not particularly risky, and impatient. Also, that former combatants are risk-seeking, impatient, and altruistic toward victims.

This study aimed at analyzing the traumatic experience many years ago on the current psycho-emotional status of displaced families as well as the ongoing inequalities regarding displaced and non-displaced communities in one of the most affected areas by the armed conflict. An interview survey was conducted among 211 displaced families and 181 non-displaced families in 2 adjacent compounds in Valledupar, Colombia. The questionnaire used questions from the validated national survey and was revised and applied by staff members of the departmental secretary of health who conducted additional in-depth interviews. The study showed that the living conditions of the displaced community were precarious. The past traumatic events many years ago and the current difficult living conditions are associated with psychological problems being more frequent among the displaced people. The displaced people had experienced more violent acts and subsequently had a larger number of emotional symptoms (fright, headache, nervousness, depression, and sleeplessness). Other stress factors like economic problems, severe disease or death of family members and unemployment prevailed among displaced persons.

A critical part of training for a surgical resident is achieving sufficient operating volume to achieve adequate competence in their independent practice. Both volume and autonomy are challenges for general surgery residency programs in Colombia. Methods. A multinstitutional study was performed, with the participation of 5 specialization programs in general surgery, from different regions of the country. The electronic Logbook was used to record procedures for a period of 12 months. An analysis of the collected database was made. Results. A total of 111 resident physicians participated in the study. There were 29,622 surgical procedures registered, corresponding to 23,206 patients. Overall, 51.7% of the procedures were elective surgeries, 46.9% were urgent surgeries and 1% were emergency surgeries. 22.6% of the procedures were performed through a minimally invasive approach. The five most frequently recorded surgical procedures were: cholecystectomy (n=4341), appendectomy (n=2558), inguinal herniorrhaphy (n=2059), umbilical herniorrhaphy (n=1225), and peritoneal lavage (n=1198). On average, each resident performed 27 surgeries per month, and in these procedures the predominant role of the resident was that of the main surgeon, from early in their training (from the second year on).

In Colombia, the Macaregua cave is known for its bat richness; thus, because bats are reservoir hosts of human microbiological pathogens, we determined if the Macaregua cave bats harbored Leptospira in the wild. A total of 85 kidney samples were collected from three bat species (Carollia perspicillata, Mormoops megalophylla, and Natalus tumidirostris) to detect Leptospira spp. The 16S rRNA gene was targeted through conventional PCR and qPCR; in addition, the LipL32 gene was detected using conventional PCR. Obtained amplicons were purified and sequenced for phylogenetic analysis. The Leptospira spp. 16S rRNA gene was detected in 51.8% bat kidneys, of which 35 sequences were obtained, all clustering within the pathogenic group. Moreover, 11 sequences presented high-identity-values with Leptospira noguchii, Leptospira alexanderi, Leptospira borgpetersenii, Leptospira kirschneri, and Leptospira mayottensis. From the 16S rRNA Leptospira spp.-positive population samples, 28 amplified for the LipL32 gene, and 23 sequences clustered in five different phylogenetic groups.

The analysis of these architectures allowed detecting two main ephemeral phenomena in Colombia, taking as a starting point the speed and the intentionality in the disappearance of these architectures, (Ephemeral utopias: ideal places for habitat, unintentionally ephemeral) and (Ephemeral dystopias: impossible places for habitat, deliberately ephemeral).

Academic analyses disagree on whether the films express an alterity that has never been subsumed by Western modernity, or just confirm that ethnic communicators are as influenced by modernity as any other audiovisual production collective. This article develops a critique of these latter scholarly analyses, because they mostly focus on end products, not on the situated analysis of their contexts, the production processes, the intercultural interactions and knowledge otherwise that result in the films. We focus on the production process of the film Ushui, created by the indigenous Wiwa people of Colombia.

From an early challenge to racism to education's role in its spread, the focus was widened, covering problems of historic presence, Afro-descendant cultural legacy and effects of slavery. In this paper we argue that, while there has been significant progress, the new education proposals for recognising the Afro-descendant presence do note implicate in a significant change in the knowledge policies on which the official curriculum is based. They do not change systems of student assessment or the logic of discipline on which knowledge circulating in the classroom is based. Nor can they change university teacher training courses, or make changes in production and editing processes of school texts. This means that bases on which what is historically considered valued for school education, decisions concerning what, how and who should teach what is regarded as relevant in the project of the nation, are not challenged.",Article,"Restrepo, Eduardo.; Rojas, Alex",Afro-Colombian studies;Afro-descendents;Colombia;Ethno-education;Multiculturalism,Afro-Colombian studies;Afro-descendents;Colombia;Ethno-education;Multiculturalism,Colombia;Colombia,

The patterns of use of space in populations depend both on ecological factors and the social systems of species. Responses of species to such factors are reflected in their population densities. This study presents estimates of population density and describes the social structure of the Chestnut-breasted Wren (Cyphorhinus thoracicus) in the Otun Quimbaya Flora and Fauna Sanctuary, Central Andes of Colombia, during a seven-month period. To obtain population densities, visual and aural censuses using song playbacks were conducted in points distributed across three habitat types. The estimated density was 2.06 individuals/ha for a total sampled area of 76.4 ha. The social structure was determined by following animals opportunistically, for the longest times possible. Wrens stayed in pairs and family groups that remained together for the duration of the study, within a territory where they conducted all their activities. All members of a social unit took part in territorial defense by means of songs and agonistic behaviors. Mean territory size for ten territories was 0.53 ha. The high population density estimate in the survey area suggests that the Chestnut-breasted Wren could be abundant in Andean forest fragments; however its dispersion capabilities might be limited due to its microhabitat requirements.",Article,"Tello, S.A.; Kattan, G.H.",Chestnut-breasted Wren; Cyphorhinus thoracicus; Colombia; population density,Chestnut-breasted Wren;Cyphorhinus thoracicus;Colombia;population density;TERRITORY SIZE;ORGANIZATION;EXTINCTIONS;RARITY;BIRDS;SONG,Colombia,2-s2.0-77952411153

The epidemiology of Hodgkin lymphoma has always been a source of fascination to researchers due to its heterogeneous characteristics. Since 1993 in Colombia, the coverage of health services has been extended, and there is now an extensive registry of healthcare processes through the Social Protection Comprehensive Information System. The aim of our study was to calculate the prevalence, and describe the demographic characteristics, of Hodgkin lymphoma in Colombia. Material and methods: This is a descriptive cross-sectional study with data from the Comprehensive Social Protection Information System of the Ministry of Health of Colombia between 2015 and 2019. Results: 4,396 cases were identified, giving a prevalence of 8.9 per 100,000 inhabitants; of these, 55% were men, with a male:female ratio of 1.2:1, with a higher prevalence in the 75–79 years age group. The departments with the highest prevalence were Risaralda (13.33), Bogotá D.C. (13.30), Boyacá (11.9), Quindío (11.49) and Santander (11.44). Conclusions: Our prevalence is higher than that reported based on population-based cancer registries in Colombia 5.4 per 100,000 inhabitants between 2016 and 2020.

The Colombian Ministry of Health has adopted the Integrated Information System on Social Protection (Sistema Integrado de Información de la Protección Social, SISPRO, by its Spanish acronym) registry to collect comprehensive information from the Colombian health system. The system provides close to universal coverage (around 95%). We aimed to establish the prevalence of prostate cancer in Colombia and to describe its demographics, based on data provided by SISPRO, openly available for scientific analysis. Methods Using the SISPRO data from 2015 through 2019, we analyzed the prevalence and demographic characteristics of patients diagnosed with prostate cancer. Results We identified a total of 43,862 patients with prostate cancer in the 5-year period and estimated a prevalence of 4.54 cases per 1,000 habitants, using as denominator males over 35 years old. We calculated a prevalence of early-onset prostate cancer (i.e., 35-54 years) of 0.14 per 1,000 habitants (791 cases in 5 years). The highest prevalence was observed in patients > 80 years (33.45 per 1,000 habitants). The departments with the highest prevalence were Bogotá, Valle del Cauca, Risaralda, and Boyacá, and the region with the lowest prevalence was Amazonas. Conclusion We describe the prevalence and demographics of prostate cancer in Colombia using the national healthcare system database.

Rodents are the biggest seed predators in Neotropical ecosystems, however, fragmentation affects their presence, therefore seed predation. Materials and methods. The percentage and removal rate of seeds by rodents was recognized in areas of interior, borderline and pasture of a dry forest in the area of Cerritos - La Virginia (Risaralda-Colombia). Between March and July 2003, rodents present in the forest were identified with the aid of 60 Sherman traps located in different areas of the fragment. To obtain the percentage and removal rate of seeds by rodents, two experiments were conducted, (the first in June and the second one in July) with a random block design, using three types of closures: total (access to insects), partial (access to rodents) and control, (access to any organism), taking into account the location within the fragment (interior, borderline, or pasture). During the first experiment (June) 2700 seeds of Samanea saman were used and during the second one (July) 6000 seeds were used. Results. Four individuals of the Heteromys australis species were captured in the interior of the forest. In June 1577 (44.87%) seeds were removed out by rodents within the interior of the forest.

The academic training and scientific production of academic surgeons is essential for the production of new knowledge. In Latin America, specifically in Colombia, there are no studies that have analyzed this production. Methods: A retrospective cross-sectional bibliometric study was carried out, in which the Colombian Ministry of Science database was consulted with the validated results up to July 2021. In the search section for research profiles, the key word “Surgery” was used, and all associated CvLAC (profiles where the information of Colombian researchers can be found) and their registered products were reviewed. Results: A total of 1701 researchers in surgery were registered in the database of the Colombian Ministry of Science, of which only 380 corresponded to academic surgeons with correct registration. Only 6 (1.6%) were found to have a Ph.D., 45 (11.8%) a fellow, and 20 (5.3%) a master's degree. 79.5% (n = 302) of Colombian academic surgeons are men.

Methods: All 783 patients first treated at INC for EOC in the three periods: (2005-2008, 2009-2011, 2012-2014), without a prior cancer diagnosis, were included in this study. Follow-up was realized by cross-linkage with governmental databases using person identification numbers. Probability of surviving 36 months since the date of entry at INC was estimated using Kaplan-Meier methods, using the log-rank test to evaluate differences between groups. We used multivariate Cox proportional hazard models to evaluate the relative effect of age, clinical stage, histological subtype and treatment first on survival. Results: The overall survival probability at 36 months was 56.5% (95% CI: 53.0, 60.0), which was stable over time.

This mediation occurred through a transatlantic network between Frankfurt, London, Manchester, and Bogota via Kingston and Cartagena, a network formed over four generations by the Stiebel-Schloss-Koppel-Kopp extended family. Methodology: A significant number of documents were analyzed, related to members of the network and to the commercial firms Schloss Brothers, Stiebel Brothers, Koppel & Schloss, and Kopp & Castello, from various archives in Germany, England, Jamaica, and Colombia, as well as from the virtual genealogical platforms MyHeritage and FamilySearch. Thus, it was possible to reconstruct in great detail the chronology of their transit locations, the particular characteristics of their commercial activities, and numerous aspects of their biographical trajectories. Originality: This study considers ethnicity as a relevant variable in the economic and commercial historiography of Colombia. Specifically, it underscores the importance of the Jewish identity of many migrants arriving in the country after the Independence, a factor that allowed them to become privileged actors in foreign trade. It also contributes to a better understanding of Jewish migrations to Colombia, a subject that has received little attention by scholars. Conclusions: The article reveals the fundamental role played by the transatlantic community formed by Ashkenazi migrants as they served both the interests of the British Empire throughout Spanish America and the project of the elites of the new Spanish American republics, who sought to insert their countries into the global capitalist economic system. In the case of Colombia, this insertion meant incorporation into transatlantic commercial circuits.",Article,"Ruiz, E.M.",Ashkenazim; Atlantic world; British Empire; Colombia; ethnicity; Germany; intermediaries; Jewish immigrants,Ashkenazim;Atlantic world;British Empire;Colombia;ethnicity;Germany;intermediaries;Jewish immigrants,Colombia,2-s2.0-85106235295

Methods: A decision tree model was used to assess the theoretical impact of routine YF vaccination of 1-year-olds (no ""catch-up"") during the interepidemic period from 1980 to 2002, avoiding capturing the impact of YF vaccine introduction in 2003. The vaccine was assumed to be 99% effective, to provide lifetime protection, and to cover 85% of the target population. Costs per disability-adjusted lifeyear (DALY) averted were computed from payer and societal perspectives. Univariate sensitivity analyses were performed. Results: During the interepidemic period, routine YF vaccination would have averted 2223 nonfatal cases of YF and 65 deaths, leading to an overall reduction of 1365 DALYs. The net cost of this vaccination would have been $25 964 813 (payer's perspective) and $16 535 465 (societal perspective). Cost per DALY averted was $19022 and $12114 from payer and societal perspectives, respectively (all costs in 2015 US dollars). Vaccination was considered cost-effective from both perspectives (ie, between 1- and 3-fold the gross domestic product per capita, $7158) and remains so if price per dose was $2.75 or less and $4.66 from payer and societal perspectives, respectively.

Development: In this study, we analyzed discourses that were built around the capital’s popular classes during the Spanish flu epidemic in 1918. The approach to primary sources, especially the graphic press of the time, accounts for the precariousness with which the poor, located in a peripheral depressed sector of the city, had to face a lethal disease that caused great confusion as it advanced rapidly through a city that lacked public health services. Whereas, the Bogotá elites, who tried to mitigate the crisis under the discourse of Christian charity, blamed the poor for their fate, which resulted in their lack of hygiene and foresight and their disorder. Conclusions: Today, a century after the flu epidemic in Bogotá and in the midst of the covid-19 pandemic, it has been evidenced in the face of a series of measures ordered by the national and local governments that include mandatory quarantines, the permanence of visions and discourses in which poor patients, far from being understood in their social reality, continue to be seen as a danger to the rest of society.",Article,Unknown,1918;Colombia;Flu;pandemic;popular classes,1918;Colombia;Flu;pandemic;popular classes,Colombia;Colombia,

Rainfall causes rivers to swell, increasing water velocity, turbulence, and turbidity. These changes may affect the ducks' foraging ability because of the harsher conditions or alteration of the aquatic macroinvertebrate resource base. We examined the relationship of Torrent Duck time budgets with food availability and rainfall in the central Andes of Colombia. Time spent foraging was not correlated with total macroinvertebrate density but was negatively correlated with density of 4 preferred families. Monthly precipitation was negatively correlated with total macroinvertebrate density but not correlated with the 4 preferred families. Time spent foraging correlated with rainfall the day before. Torrent Duck time budgets result from interactions among several factors: the ducks' foraging tactics, prey type, and river conditions that affect ducks directly, and indirectly through prey availability. Three of the 4 preferred invertebrate families are filter-feeding larvae that adhere to rocks and are therefore less affected by changes in river flow than other prey types. Thus, Torrent Duck foraging time is independent of overall invertebrate abundance but responds strongly to changes in the density of the 4 most-consumed families. Foraging time is also affected by previous-day rainfall, suggesting that increases in water flow or turbidity have a direct effect on the ducks' foraging efficiency. We conclude that physical conditions of the river habitat impose restrictions on the ducks' activities, both directly and through an indirect interaction with food availability.",Article,"Cardona, W.; Kattan, G.H.",Anatidae; Andean river; aquatic macroinvertebrate; foraging behavior; Colombia,Anatidae;Andean river;aquatic macroinvertebrate;foraging behavior;Colombia;RESPONSES;SELECTION;PATTERNS;RIVER,Colombia,2-s2.0-85069196370

An asbestos chrysotile mine has also operated in Colombia since 1980 in Campamento (Antioquia). In the framework of developing the National Asbestos Profile for Colombia, in this study, we estimated the population residing in the vicinity of asbestos processing plants or the mine and, therefore, potentially at risk of disease. Using a geographic information system, demographic data obtained from the last two general population censuses were processed to determine the number of people living within the concentric circles surrounding the asbestos facilities and the mine. In previous studies conducted in different countries of the world, an increased risk of asbestos-related diseases has been reported for people living at different distance bands from asbestos processing facilities. Based on these studies, circles of 500, 1000, 2000, 5000, and 10,000 m radii, centered on the asbestos processing facilities and the mine that operated in Colombia, were combined with the census data to estimate the number of people living within these radii. Large numbers of people were identified. It is estimated that in 2005, at the country level, 10,489 people lived within 500 m of an asbestos processing facility or mine.

An Empirical Approach from Cultural Economics Applied to the Carnival of Barranquilla (Colombia),"The empirical analysis of individual participation in local and popular feasts and festivals is a field little explored by cultural economists. This article proposes a methodological scheme to analyse the profile of the participants in local and popular feasts and carnivals, allowing the establishment of a taxonomy that captures the heterogeneity of the participants replicable to other festivities and carnivals around the world. Similarly, participation equations that allow the analysis of the influence of context variables on individual decisions to participate in these types of events are estimated. For this, the Carnival of Barranquilla, the largest and most representative popular celebration in Colombia and declared by UNESCO as Intangible Cultural Heritage of Humanity, is used as a case study. The data were obtained from the Citizen Perception Survey of the Barranquilla Como Vamos programme, which evaluates the quality of life and the fulfilment of development plans in that city, and an empirical strategy is employed consisting of the estimation of a probit discrete choice model, which allows modelling the individual decisions of a time-intensive good, such as a carnival, with a strong influence of traditional variables, such as cultural capital and the availability of leisure time, and other context variables: location of people in the territory, stratification and poverty. The different profiles found offer information on the different strategies that can be implemented from public policy to stimulate greater participation by the population in popular festivities and festivals.",Article,"Espinosa, A.E.; Martos, L.P.; Quintero, L.A.",Carnival of Barranquilla; cultural participation; intangible heritage; probit models; Colombia,Carnival of Barranquilla;cultural participation;intangible heritage;probit models;Colombia;ATTENDANCE;DETERMINANTS,Colombia;Spain,

Colombia","The Inter-American Human Rights system continues to be o ne full of surprises. On the one hand, there are State official agencies that see no distinction between the system itself and any defense in a typical criminal case, and on the other hand, there is an Inter-American Court that only exceptionally rescues the judicial internal system of the States. That was exactly what occurred in the Massacre of Santo Domingo v. Colombia case involving a tragic event where 17 civilians were killed and 27 were injured while a violent fight took place between the Colombian military and the FARC. The first part of this manuscript will feature the inconsistencies of the State -the only entity with standing before the Court- which resorted to a defense that assailed its own Judicial Branch by both denouncing an alleged fraud on the part of the Prosecutor's Office and by dismissing the decisions made by the criminal and administrative judicial instances. Ironically enough, this strategy could well be the total opposite of what an appropriate defense of the troops involved in this tragic event should look like. The second part of this manuscript will feature the form in which the Inter-American Court ended up saving the judicial branch when it labeled the grounds of the State agent (as to the defense presented before the IAHR Commission) as estoppel and when it described such behavior, without hesitation, as contrary to the principles of good faith, equity and legal stability.",Article,"Sanjuan, Rafael A.Prieto",Colombia;Due Process;Estoppel;Human Rights Inter-American Court of Human Rights;International Litigation;Judicial Protection;Redress,Colombia;Due Process;Estoppel;Human Rights Inter-American Court of Human Rights;International Litigation;Judicial Protection;Redress,Colombia,

We tested WC as a diagnostic tool to identify people with visceral adiposity in Hispanics from the Latin America region. Methods: We used the area of visceral adipose tissue (VAT) >= 100 cm(2) at the level between the 4th and 5th lumbar vertebrae in abdominal CT scans as a marker of visceral adiposity and established the optimal WC threshold for men and women by means of receiver operating characteristic (ROC) curves. Results: 179 men and 278 women from Mexico, El Salvador, Venezuela, Colombia and Paraguay were included. The ROC curves were highly discriminative of excess VAT for men and women (area under the curve 0.9 and 0.8 respectively) and the WC threshold was identified at 94 cm for men and between 90 and 92 cm for women. Conclusion: In men the WC cutoff was equal to that proposed for europids and suggested for US adults who may have strong genetic contribution to insulin resistance such as Hispanics. In women the threshold was significantly higher than previously proposed for South and Central Americans. (C) 2011 Elsevier Ireland Ltd.

The global incidence is increasing, and Latin America is no exception. This article reviews MRSA clonal distribution in Latin America and implications for clinical practice. Design: A PubMed literature search (1966-2008) identified 32 articles that characterized MRSA clones in Latin America. Results: Data from these articles show that since 1990, several epidemic MRSA clones have spread in Latin America. The multidrug-resistant Brazilian clone is widespread, especially in Brazil and Argentina, but more recently clones with susceptibility to a range of antibiotics have been detected in Brazil, whereas in Argentina, as in Chile, Colombia and Paraguay, the multidrug-resistant Cordobes/Chilean clone prevails. In Mexico, the New York/Japan clone is most frequent. Data were not available from every country and, despite the increasing prevalence of community MRSA infections, most were collected from tertiary care centers. Conclusions: A variety of epidemic MRSA clones are circulating in Latin America, some of which harbor genes that encode multidrug resistance or enhanced pathogenicity. Continued collection and reporting of epidemiological data is crucial for effective prevention and treatment. (C) 2009 International Society for Infectious Diseases. Published by Elsevier Ltd.

Ongoing surveillance is essential to support infection control committees and clinicians in the prevention and treatment of infection. However, in Latin America, resources for monitoring the changing epidemiology of MRSA remain limited. In this article, we review the current situation of MRSA in Latin America in order to highlight the need for a more harmonised effort to improve its management. Literature in the PubMed and SciELO databases as well as the website of the Pan American Health Organization were searched for articles and information about the epidemiology of MRSA in Latin America. MRSA is already the leading cause of nosocomial infection in the Latin American region, and the number of reports of community-acquired MRSA infections is also rising. However, the extent of the problem is not fully understood, especially since data tend to come from large hospitals whereas much of the population is served by small community healthcare centres that do not have extensive facilities for performing microbiological surveillance. In conclusion, wider-reaching and co-ordinated programmes to provide regular MRSA surveillance reports are required across the Latin American region.

Landscape transformation is driven not only by national policies and markets, but also by global market dynamics associated with an increased role for transnational traders and investors. National and global trends affect a disparate number of social, political and economic interactions taking place at the local level, which ultimately shapes land-use and socio-economic change. This paper reviews five different trajectories of landscape change in tropical Latin America, and discusses their implications for development and conservation: (1) Market-driven growth of agribusiness; (2) expansion and modernization of traditional cattle ranching; (3) slow growth of peasant agriculture; (4) logging in production forest frontiers; and (5) resurgence of agro-extractive economies. Contrasting trade-offs between economic development and forest conservation emerge across these landscapes, calling for nuanced policy responses to manage them in the context of climate change. This discussion sets the background to assess how reduction of emissions from deforestation and forest degradation and enhancing carbon stocks (REDD+) aims should be better aligned with current landscape trajectories and associated actors to better address climate-change mitigation in forest landscapes with effective and equitable outcomes.",Article,"Pacheco, P.; Aguilar-Stoen, M.; Borner, J.; Etter, A.; Putzel, L.; Diaz, M.D.V.",drivers; land-use change; landscapes; Latin America; REDD,drivers;land-use change;landscapes;Latin America;REDD;LAND-USE;BRAZILIAN AMAZON;ENVIRONMENTAL SERVICES;LEVEL EVIDENCE;DEFORESTATION;FORESTS;CONSERVATION;AGRICULTURE;EXPANSION;EMISSIONS,Indonesia;Norway;Brazil;Colombia;United States,2-s2.0-84857900512

Numerous epidemiological factors affect the probability of developing breast or ovarian cancer, but no predictor is as determinant as inheriting a mutation in BRCA1 or BRCA2. The concept of the founder effect explains the reduced genetic variability in some populations, according to the theory that new populations can beformed from a reduced number of individuals, so the new population would carry only a small fraction of the genetic variability of the original population. The main purpose of this review is to provide an update on the state of the art in founder mutations and some recurrent mutations that have recently been described in Latin America. Methods. A literature search was performed in the electronic databases of PUBMED, EMBASE, LILACS, and BIREME using the terms BRCA1, BRCA2, founder mutation, Latin American population, and Hispanic. Sixty-two papers were identified, of which 38 were considered relevant for this review. Each result is shown per country. Results. In Latin America, clear founder effects have been reported in Mexico (BRCA1 del exons 9-12), Brazil (BRCA1 5382insC and BRCA2 c.156_157insAlu), and Colombia (BRCA1 3450del4, A1708E, and BRCA2 3034del4) and in Latinas residing in Southern California (BRCA1 185delAG, IVS5+1G>A, S955x, and R1443x). Of these, mutation BRCA1 3450del4 has also been reported in Brazil and Chile, whereas mutation BRCA2 3034del4 has been reported in Argentina and Peru. These data support the idea that although most Hispanic populations are the result of a mixture between Europeans, Africans, and Amerindians, the relative proportion of each genetic component varies throughout the Hispanic populations, making it necessary to identify the mutations characteristic of each population to generate mutation profiles adjusted to each one of them. Conclusion. In Latin American countries, and even among regions of the same country, there is great heterogeneity of ancestors. Therefore, Latinas should not be analyzed like other population groups without taking into account their genetic ancestry. The presence of founder mutations in specific population groups represents a cost-effective analysis. The importance of determining the founder mutations lies mainly in the decrease in costs. If we manage to decrease costs, screenings could be offered more widely and cover a larger number of women.",Review,"Ossa, C.A.; Torres, D.",Breast cancer; BRCA1; BRCA2; Latin America; Hereditary cancer; Hispanics,Breast cancer;BRCA1;BRCA2;Latin America;Hereditary cancer;Hispanics;BREAST-CANCER PATIENTS;OVARIAN-CANCER;BREAST/OVARIAN CANCER;HIGH-RISK;GERMLINE MUTATIONS;FAMILY-HISTORY;PREVALENCE;POPULATION;FREQUENCY;COLOMBIA,Colombia,2-s2.0-84978488585

The present study aimed to characterize energy intake (EI) and to describe the main food sources of energy in representative samples of the urban population from eight LA countries from the Latin American Study in Nutrition and Health (ELANS). Design: Cross-sectional study. Usual dietary intake was assessed with two non-consecutive 24 h dietary recalls.

Final sample comprised 9218 individuals, of whom 6648 (72.1 %) were considered plausible reporters. Results: Overall, mean EI was 8196 kJ/d (1959 kcal/d), with a balanced distribution of macronutrients (54% carbohydrate, 30% fat, 16% protein). Main food sources of energy were grains, pasta and bread (28%), followed by meat and eggs (19%), oils and fats (10%), non-alcoholic homemade beverages (6%) and ready-to-drink beverages (6%). More than 25% of EI was provided from food sources rich in sugar and fat, like sugary drinks, pastries, chips and candies. Meanwhile, only 18% of EI was from food sources rich in fibre and micronutrients, such as whole grains, roots, fruits, vegetables, beans, fish and nuts.

It also documents sociopolitical barriers and facilitators involved in urban interventions linked with active living in the ten most populated urban settings of Latin America. The synthesis of evidence indicates that several attributes of urban environments are associated with physical activity, including land-use mix and cycling infrastructure. The documentary analysis indicated that despite the benefits and opportunities provided by the programs and existing infrastructure in the examined cities, an overall concern is the rising inequality in the coverage and distribution of the initiatives in the region. If these programs and initiatives are to achieve a real population level effect that helps to reduce health disparities, they need to examine their social and spatial distribution within the cities so they can reach underserved populations and develop to their full potential.

These can be addressed more effectively in a collaborative setting that fosters open exchange of knowledge. In this work, the Latin American and Caribbean Consortium on Dementia (LAC-CD) proposes an agenda for integration to deliver a Knowledge to Action Framework (KtAF).

Mutation screening of the GALNS was performed by genomic PCR and direct sequence analyses in 20 NIPS IVA patients from Latin America. In this study, 12 different gene mutations including nine unreported ones were identified in 16 severe and four attenuated patients and accounted for 90.0% of the unrelated mutant alleles. The gene alterations were missense mutations except one insertion. Six recurrent mutations, p.A75G, p.G116S, p.G139S., p.N164T, p.R380S, and p.R386C, accounted for 5.0, 10.0, 5.0, 7.5, 5.0, and 32.5% of the unrelated mutant alleles, respectively. The p.R386C mutation was identified in all Latin American populations studied. Eleven mutations correlated with a severe form, while one mutation, p.R380S, was associated with an attenuated form. MPS IVA patients had an elevation of urine and plasma keratan sulfate (KS) concentrations compared with those of the age-matched control. KS concentrations in severe patients were higher than those in attenuated patients.

The researchers used qualitative methods to understand the motivations of motorcycle users that might contribute to this growth in six cities: Barranquilla, Bogota (Colombia), Sao Paulo, Recife (Brazil), Caracas (Venezuela), and Buenos Aires (Argentina). Researchers used semi-structured interviews and focus groups to gather data from six categories of motorcycle users: motorcycle taxi drivers, motorcycle taxi users, motorcyclists for delivery, motorcyclists for private use, owners in the process of selling their motorcycles, and potential motorcyclists (those seeking to buy motorcycles). Common themes emerged across the six cities, including the time advantage that motorcycles offered versus deficient public transportation and congested auto traffic, the low cost of motorcycles versus other transport modes, the vulnerability of motorcyclists to traffic injury and death, and cultural aspects of motorcycle use. Policy implications include the need to make motorcycle travel safer and improve public transportation in Latin American cities. (C) 2016 Elsevier Ltd.

Nevertheless, the characteristics and uses in South America are unknown. Objectives: To identify sources, characteristics, and uses of RWE in Argentina, Brazil, Colombia, and Chile, and evaluate the context-specific challenges. The implications for future regulation and responsible management of RWE in the region are also considered. Methods: A systematic literature review, database mapping, and targeted gray literature search were conducted to identify the sources and characteristics of RWE. Findings were validated by key opinion leaders attending workshops in 4 South American countries. Results: A database mapping exercise revealed 407 unique databases. Geographic scope, database type, population, and outcomes captured were reported. Characteristics of national health information systems show efforts to collect interoperable data from service providers, insurers, and government agencies, but that initiatives are hampered by fragmentation, lack of stewardship, and resources. In South America, RWE is mainly used for pharmacovigilance and as pure academic research, but less so for health technology assessment decision making or pricing negotiations and not at all to inform early access schemes.

The search was limited to references to basic science, clinical science, or social medicine. A survey was sent by e-mail to researchers who lived in 15 of the 16 countries (the exception being Nicaragua). The survey asked about the researcher's area of work (basic science, clinical science, or public health) the level of skill in using databases, the frequency and most utilized, the impact from not having access to the full text of articles when preparing a manuscript, and how the respondent usually obtained the full-text version of articles. Results. A total of 586 e-mail messages with the survey were sent out, and 185 responses were received (32%).

Results: A total of 80.2% (PAHO model) to 66.4% (Chilean model) of foods met the criteria for regulation. The categories with the highest proportion of regulated products were meats (97.3% PAHO model; 87.5% Chilean model), sweets (95.6% PAHO) and snacks (Chilean model). The category with the lowest proportions of regulated products were cereals (47.3% PAHO model) and miscellaneous foods and fish/seafood (39.0% and 39.5%, respectively, Chilean model). Conclusions: Under both the PAHO and Chilean nutrient profile models, the majority of packaged foods available in Bogota would be eligible to receive front-of-package warning labels.

The complex dynamics of social-ecological systems (SES), the need for management capacities, and communities' limited empowerment and participation skills present challenges for community-based natural resource management (CBNRM) strategies. We analyzed the applicability of prospective structural analysis (PSA), a strategic foresight tool, to support decision making and to foster sustainable management and capacity building in CBNRM contexts and the modifications necessary to use the tool in such contexts. By testing PSA in three SES in Colombia, Mexico, and Argentina, we gathered information regarding the potential of this tool and its adaptation requirements. The results suggest that the tool can be adapted to these contexts and contribute to fostering sustainable management and capacity building. It helped identify the systems' dynamics, thus increasing the communities' knowledge about their SES and informing the decision-making process. Additionally, it drove a learning process that both fostered empowerment and built participation skills. The process demanded both time and effort, and required external monitoring and facilitation, but community members could be trained to master it.

The survey asked about the researcher's area of work (basic science, clinical science, or public health), the level of skill in using databases, the frequency and type of access to the databases most utilized, the impact from not having access to the full text of articles when preparing a manuscript, and how the respondent usually obtained the full-text version of articles. Results. A total of 586 e-mail messages with the survey were sent out, and 185 responses were received (32%). The databases most utilized to obtain biomedical information were MEDLINE (34.1%), general search engines (Google, Yahoo!, and AltaVista) (15.9%), on-line journals (9.8%), BIREME-LILACS (6.0%), BioMedNet (5.4%), the databases of the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention of the United States of America (5.2%), and the Cochrane Library (4.9%). Of the respondents, 64% said they had average or advanced abilities in using MEDLINE. However, 71% of the respondents did not use or were not aware of the MEDLINE Medical Subject Headings (MeSH), a controlled vocabulary established by the National Library of Medicine of the United States of America for indexing articles. The frequency of accessing the databases was similar in all the countries studied, without significant differences in terms of the type of access (authorized access to commercial databases, unauthorized access to those databases, or access to databases available for free) or the level of abilities. Of the respondents, 87% said they had not included important references in the articles that they had published because they had not had access to the full text of those items, and 56% said they had cited articles that they had not read in full. In addition, 7.6% of the respondents admitted to unauthorized use of limited-access databases, such as through borrowed passwords or copied disks. More than two-thirds of the respondents said they obtained the full text of articles through photocopies or directly from the authors. Conclusions. In order to encourage scientific output by Latin American researchers, more of them need to be trained in the use of the most frequently used databases, especially MEDLINE. Those researchers also need to have expanded access to the biomedical literature.",Review,"Ospina, Edgar Guillermo.; Unknown.; Cardona, Andres Felipe","Access to information;Databases, bibliographic;Latin America","Access to information;Databases, bibliographic;Latin America",Colombia;Colombia;Colombia,

Evidence from Chile, Peru, Ecuador, Colombia, Guatemala and Mexico","The current challenge for world agriculture is to provide food for a growing population, within a context of environmental degradation and economic inequality. The challenge is how to produce accessible, healthy, diverse, nutritious, safe and abundant food in a way that is sustainable, allowing farmers to exert food sovereignty while at the same time addressing ecosystem conservation. The aim of this study is to explore the potential contribution of traditional agriculture to food sovereignty and also to understand the challenges that indigenous communities are facing today. Our case studies are from six Latin-American countries: Chile, Peru, Ecuador, Colombia, Guatemala and Mexico, where we carried out semi-structured, guided visits and field observations. Our results shed light on how traditional agricultural knowledge, techniques and practices can contribute to these issues, but also to the need of protecting and recovering the cultural and ecological heritage. There is a need to resolve public management issues, related to development investment, technological packages, cultural loss and gender. If these are not addressed, the potential contribution of ancient agricultural knowledge will fail to contribute to strengthen food sovereignty and maintain the local markets, which are also places for seed exchange, knowledge sharing and social networking.",Article,"Parraguez-Vergara, E.; Contreras, B.; Clavijo, N.; Villegas, V.; Paucar, N.; Ther, F.",Traditional agriculture; food sovereignty; food; Latin America; indigenous people; campesinos,Traditional agriculture;food sovereignty;food;Latin America;indigenous people;campesinos;GLOBAL FOOD;CLIMATE-CHANGE;SECURITY;SYSTEM;WATER;INSECURITY;CONTEXT;HEALTH;SOIL,Mexico;Colombia;Guatemala;Peru;Chile,2-s2.0-85049149762

However, little evidence on this relationship is available from developing countries, and recognition of this relationship may have important implications for substance demand reduction strategies, including efforts to prevent and treat substance use and related problems. Latin America and the Caribbean is a rich and diverse region of the world with a large range of social and cultural influences. A working group constituted by the Inter-American Drug Abuse Control Commission and the Center for Addiction and Mental Health in June, 2010 identified research on this relationship as a priority area for a multinational research partnership. Methods: This paper examines the association between self-reported child maltreatment and use in the past 12 months of alcohol and cannabis in 2294 university students in seven participating universities in six participating countries: Colombia, El Salvador, Jamaica, Nicaragua, Panama and Uruguay. The research also considers the possible impact of religiosity and minimal psychological distress as factors contributing to resiliency in these samples. Results: The results showed that experience of maltreatment was associated with increased use of alcohol and cannabis. However, the effects differed depending on the type of maltreatment experienced. Higher levels of religiosity were consistently associated with lower levels of alcohol and cannabis use, but we found no evidence of an impact of minimal psychological distress on these measures. Conclusions: This preliminary study shows that the experience of maltreatment may increase the risk of alcohol and cannabis use among university students in Latin American and Caribbean countries, but that higher levels of religiosity may reduce that risk. More work to determine the nature and significance of these relationships is needed.

Methods We conducted a survey among participants of the 5th Latin American Future Trends Conference in October 2015. Thirty-seven respondents from eight Latin American countries provided insights about the current and preferred future status of HTA implementation related to human capacity building, HTA financing, process and organizational structure for HTA, scope of mandatory HTA, decision criteria, standardization of HTA methodology, mandating the use of local data, and international collaboration in HTA. Results Survey respondents reported insufficient human resources and public investment for HTA implementation. Organizational structure and legislation framework of HTA differ considerably across countries. According to survey respondents, in the future policymakers should rely more on the assessment of therapeutic value, cost-effectiveness, and budget impact criteria by applying explicit thresholds, potentially in a multicriteria decision analysis framework. HTA should not be restricted to policy decisions of new technologies but it should also be used for the revision of previous decisions. In addition, the quality and transparency of HTA have to be strengthened. Conclusions HTA plays an increasingly important role in Latin American countries.

However, this gene has also been found to be mutated in cases of idiopathic short stature (ISS) with a 3–15% frequency. In this study, the multiplex ligation-dependent probe amplification (MLPA) technique was employed to determine the frequency of SHOX gene mutations and their conserved noncoding elements (CNE) in Colombian patients with ISS. Patients were referred from different centers around the county. From a sample of 62 patients, 8.1% deletions and insertions in the intragenic regions and in the CNE were found. This result is similar to others published in other countries. Moreover, an isolated case of CNE 9 duplication and a new intron 6b deletion in another patient, associated with ISS, are described.

To assess the economic impact of dengue in Latin America and the Caribbean using a systematic review that includes studies not previously considered by other reviews. Methods. Cochrane methodology was used to conduct a systematic review of the cost of dengue in Latin America. PubMed Central, EMBASE, and the Biblioteca Virtual en Saludwhich includes scientific, peer-reviewed journals not indexed by other databases-were searched from inception through August 2016. All articles that reported cost of illness data for countries in Latin America were included. Included studies underwent a methodological appraisal using a seven-question instrument designed for cost of illness studies. Extracted data were direct and indirect costs for outpatient and hospitalized cases and total cost of the disease. Values were adjusted to 2015 US dollars using the consumer price index. Results. From a total of 848 initial references, 17 studies were included, mainly from Brazil, Colombia, Cuba, Mexico, and Puerto Rico; costs were available for 39 countries. The methodological appraisal showed that 70% of the studies met more than 70% of the evaluated items. The main economic impact of dengue was due to productivity costs. Average annual cost was more than US$3 billion. Direct costs represented over 70% of the total share for hospitalized cases. For outpatients, direct medical costs were low, but social costs were significant since indirect costs may account for up to 80% of the total cost. Conclusions.

Using a quantitative comparison of household survey data and an analysis of the content of the reforms, we evaluate the effects of Colombia's health reforms on gender equity. We find that several aspects of these reforms hold promise for greater gender equity, such as the resulting increase in women's health insurance coverage. However, the reforms have not achieved gender equity due to the persistence of fees which discriminate against women and the introduction of a two-tier health system in which women heads of household and the poor are concentrated in a lower quality health system.

An eight-country observational study,"Background: Characteristics of the neighborhood built environment are associated with physical activity (PA). However, few studies with representative samples have examined environmental correlates of domain-specific PA in Latin America. We examined the associations of the perceived neighborhood built environment with domain-specific PA in a large sample of adults from eight Latin American countries. Methods: This study examined data from 8185 adults (aged 18-65 years) from eight Latin American countries. The Neighbourhood Environment Walkability Survey - Abbreviated (NEWS-A) scale was used to assess perceptions of land use mix-diversity, land use mix-access, street connectivity, walking/cycling facilities, aesthetics, safety from traffic, and safety from crime. Perceived proximity from home to public open spaces (metropolitan parks, playgrounds, public squares) and to shopping centers was also measured. Transport-related and leisure-time PA were assessed using the long form of the International Physical Activity Questionnaire. Both logistic and linear regression models were estimated on pooled data. Results: Perceptions of higher land use mix-access (OR: 1.40; 95% CI: 1.22,1.61), the existence of many alternative routes in the neighbourhood (1.12; 1.04,1.20), slow speed of traffic (1.19; 1.03,1.35) and few drivers exceeding the speed limits (1.09; 1.03,1.15) were associated with greater odds of reporting at least 10 min/week of transport-related PA. Perceptions of higher levels of land use mix-diversity, better aesthetics and greater safety from crime, the presence of crosswalks and pedestrian signals, and greater proximity of shopping centers were associated with more min/week of transport-related PA. Perceptions of higher land use mix-diversity (1.12; 1.05,1.20), higher land use mix-access (1.27; 1.13,1.43), more walking/cycling facilities (1.18; 1.09,1.28), and better aesthetics (1.10; 1.02,1.18) were associated with greater odds of engaging in at least 10 min/week of leisure-time PA versus none. Perceptions of higher land use mix-diversity were associated with more min/week of leisure PA.

Breast cancer is the most common malignancy and the leading cause of cancer-related mortality among women in Latin America (LA). The main objective of this study was to develop a comprehensive understanding of the genomic epidemiology of HBOC throughout the establishment of The Latin American consortium for HBOC-LACAM, consisting of specialists from 5 countries in LA and the description of the genomic results from the first phase of the study. Methods: We have recruited 403 individuals that fulfilled the criteria for HBOC from 11 health institutions of Argentina, Colombia, Guatemala, Mexico and Peru. A pilot cohort of 222 individuals was analyzed by NGS gene panels. One hundred forty-three genes were selected on the basis of their putative role in susceptibility to different hereditary cancers. Libraries were sequenced in MiSeq (Illumina, Inc.) and PGM (Ion Torrent-Thermo Fisher Scientific) platforms. Results: The overall prevalence of pathogenic variants was 17% (38/222); the distribution spanned 14 genes and varied by country. The highest relative prevalence of pathogenic variants was found in patients from Argentina (25%, 14/57), followed by Mexico (18%, 12/68), Guatemala (16%, 3/19), and Colombia (13%, 10/78). Pathogenic variants were found in BRCA1 (20%) and BRCA2 (29%) genes. Pathogenic variants were found in other 12 genes, including high and moderate risk genes such as MSH2, MSH6, MUTYH, and PALB2. Additional pathogenic variants were found in HBOC unrelated genes such as DCLRE1C, WRN, PDE11A, and PDGFB. Conclusion: In this first phase of the project, we recruited 403 individuals and evaluated the germline genetic alterations in an initial cohort of 222 patients among 4 countries. Our data show for the first time in LA the distribution of pathogenic variants in a broad set of cancer susceptibility genes in HBOC.

We applied an intermediate disturbance-complexity approach to the land-use changes of a Latin American biocultural landscape (Cauca river valley, Colombia, 1943–2010), which accounts for the joint behaviour of human appropriation of photosynthetic capacity used as a measure of disturbance, and a selection of land metrics that account for landscape ecological functionality. We also delved deeper into local land-use changes in order to identify the main socioeconomic drivers and ruling agencies at stake. The results show that traditional organic mixed-farming tended to disappear as a result of sugarcane intensification. The analysis confirms the intermediate disturbance-complexity hypothesis by showing a nonlinear relationship, where the highest level of landscape complexity (heterogeneity–connectivity) is attained when disturbance peaks at 50–60%. The study proves the usefulness of transferring the concept of intermediate disturbance to biocultural landscapes and suggests that conservation of heterogeneous and well-connected mixed-farming, with a positive interplay between intermediate level of disturbances and land-use complexity endowed with a rich intercultural heritage, will preserve a wildlife-friendly agro-ecological matrix likely to house high biodiversity and ecosystem services.",Article,"Marull, Joan.; Delgadillo, Olga Lucia.; Unknown.; Unknown.; Unknown",Biocultural heritage;Colombia;Disturbance ecology;Human appropriation of net primary production;Landscape agroecology;Latin America,Biocultural heritage;Colombia;Disturbance ecology;Human appropriation of net primary production;Landscape agroecology;Latin America,Colombia;Spain;Austria,

Methods This is a descriptive epidemiological study using the International Statistical Classification of Diseases and Related Health Problems as search terms related to SLE, based on SISPRO data. Criteria for diagnosis are not explicitly addressed in each individual case. Results National records report 41,804 patients with a diagnosis of SLE for an estimated prevalence of 91.9/100,000 subjects (based on a total population of 47,663,162), being more frequent in women (89% cases). When adjusted, female and male prevalences were 204.3 and 20.2 per 100,000 (ratio 10.1) with a 7.9:1 female:male ratio, and were highest in the 45-49-year age group. Conclusions This is the first study that describes demographic characteristics of SLE in Colombia, with useful information for decision makers. It also suggests a similar prevalence to other countries.",Article,"Fernandez-Avila, D.G.; Bernal-Macas, S.; Rincn-Riao, D.N.; Dvila, J.M.G.; Rosselli, D.",Colombia; Latin America; registries; systemic lupus erythematosus,Colombia;Latin America;registries;systemic lupus erythematosus;EPIDEMIOLOGY;POPULATION;RACE,Colombia,2-s2.0-85070455251

Data were extracted from different sources and refer to the 1980-2014 period. Empirical results are not conclusive. It is not possible to determine the path that these two major blocs must follow to conquer an expanded and deeper economic integration, although the patterns followed by the member country decisions for a greater economic convergence suggest that this may be feasible in the medium and long run. The economic convergence index shows this tendency.

The purpose of this paper is to describe the methods and procedures used for the assessment of physical activity and sedentary time in the Latin American Study of Nutrition and Health (Estudio Latinoamericano de NutriciOn y Salud; ELANS). ELANS is a multicentre, cross-sectional and surveillance study of a nationally representative sample from eight Latin American countries: Argentina, Brazil, Chile, Colombia, Costa Rica, Ecuador, Peru, and Venezuela. Two instruments were used to evaluate different domains and intensities of physical activity and sedentary time: self-reported data and a triaxial accelerometer (model GT3X+). ELANS will generate important self-reported and objective information for the Latin American populations, namely: evidence on the distribution of physical activity and sedentary time across population subgroups (e.g. sex, age, socioeconomic- and educational level). These sets of information will increase the evidence base and can help to inform future intervention strategies in Latin America; self-reported and objective information on physical activity and sedentary time.

However, evidence on patterns of transportation in Latin America is scarce. Therefore, the aim of this study was to quantify and characterise socio-demographic patterns of public, private and active travel in Latin American countries. Methods: Data from the Latin American Study of Nutrition and Health, a population-based, cross-sectional survey conducted in eight Latin American countries including Argentina, Brazil, Chile, Colombia, Costa Rica, Ecuador, Peru and Venezuela (n = 9218; age range: 15-65 years). Transportation modes include public (bus, taxi, subway and train), private (car and motorcycle) and active (walking and/or cycling). Outcomes for this study include time spent in different modes of transportation. We performed overall and country-specific descriptive analyses to examine differences by sex, age, socioeconomic and education level. Results: For the overall cohort, public transport represent 34.9% of the total travel time, whereas private, walking and cycling represent 48.2%, 10.6% and 6.3% of the total travel time. Time spent using public travel was highest in Venezuela (48.4%); Peru had the highest proportions of private travel (52.5%); Time spent walking and cycling was highest in Costa Rica (14.8% and 12.2%, respectively). The average travel time spent in public and private transport were 299.5 min/week (95% CI: 292.4307.0) and 379.6 min/week (95% CI: 368.0, 391.5) respectively; figures for walking and cycling were 186.9 min/week (95% CI: 181.8, 191.9) and 201.1 min/week (95% CI: 187.8, 216.9). Conclusions: Public and private transport were the most common forms of travel in Latin America. Active travel (walking or cycling) represent 17% of total physical activity, therefore, promoting and providing the right infrastructure for active commuting could translate in increasing the population overall levels of physical activity in Latin America.",Article,"Ferrari, G.L.D.; Kovalskys, I.; Fisberg, M.; Gomez, G.; Rigotti, A.; Sanabria, L.Y.C.; Garcia, M.C.Y.; Torres, R.G.P.; Herrera-Cuenca, M.; Zimberg, I.Z.; Guajardo, V.; Pratt, M.; Goncalves, P.B.; Rosales-Salas, J.; Cristi-Montero, C.; Rodriguez-Rodriguez, F.; Waddell, H.; Petermann-Rocha, F.; Celis-Morales, C.A.; Chaput, J.P.; Scholes, S.; Sole, D.",Physical activity; Active travel; Transport; Latin America,Physical activity;Active travel;Transport;Latin America;PHYSICAL-ACTIVITY QUESTIONNAIRE;HEALTH;EPIDEMIOLOGY;RELIABILITY,Chile;Brazil;Argentina;Costa Rica;Colombia;Ecuador;Peru;Venezuela;United States;United Kingdom;Canada,2-s2.0-85075428798

The results of this double aging process are especially striking for health care services because of the concurrent epidemiologic transition, which has led to infectious diseases being replaced by noninfectious, habitually chronic diseases that occur predominantly in older age. In these circumstances, older adults begin to predominate among the patients whom physicians in Latin America now serve and in the near future, older adults will constitute the immense majority of those patients. To respond to this situation, the training of professionals responsible for providing care to older adults should be improved, and the preparation of specialists in geriatric medicine should be enhanced both quantitatively and qualitatively. Future doctors should have the knowledge, abilities, and attitudes to enable them to appropriately serve this population segment. With these aims in mind, structures and procedures should be established that make it possible to impart the specific contents of geriatric medicine during medical school not only as a part of the traditional vertical teaching of the core curriculum of geriatric medicine, but also through the horizontal teaching of some of the material in other subjects. This article discusses why, with what objectives, with what contents, with what procedures, and with what staffing and materials the training of professionals in geriatric medicine should be carried out, and why it is time to give priority to this undertaking. Putting into place the measures proposed in this article should facilitate the incorporation of this subject-matter into the curricula of the medical schools of Latin America.",Article,"Cano, C.; Gutierrez, L.M.; Marin, P.P.; Martinez, F.M.; Pelaez, M.; Manas, L.R.; Vega, E.; Zuniga, C.",education; medical; undergraduate; geriatrics; Latin America,education;medical;undergraduate;geriatrics;Latin America,Colombia;Mexico;Chile;Costa Rica;United States;Spain;Cuba,2-s2.0-21644482087

We construct a measure of Revealed Comparative Advantage (RCA) by 3-digit ISIC sector, country, and year. This RCA accounts for both imports and exports. The empirical analyses explore the correlation between the RCAs of LA and the two Asian economies. Econometric estimates suggest that the specialization pattern of LA-with the exception of Mexico-has been moving in opposite direction to the trade specialization pattern of China and India.

The aim of this study was to assess sleep disturbances among medical students, and whether associations with academic performance, depressive symptoms or substance use were present. Methods: Cross-sectional study in which 544 medical students of the Pontificia Universidad Javeriana in Bogota, Colombia were included. Using a computer-based survey, self-reported variables were assessed, including demographics, Pittsburgh Sleep Quality Index (PSQI), Epworth Sleepiness Scale (ESS), Berlin Questionnaire, Diagnostic and Statistical Manual of Mental Disorders (DSM) - IV depression criteria, Grade Point Average (GPA), and substance use. Associations between these variables were obtained. Results: Fifty-four percent of students were women. Poor sleep quality (PSQI>5) and daytime sleepiness (ESS>10) were found in 65% of the population. A higher GPA was more frequent in students with good sleep quality (OR= 2.6 [1.5-4.5]), lack of daytime sleepiness (OR= 2 [1.3-3.1]) and low risk of Obstructive Sleep Apnea Syndrome (OSAS) (OR= 3.1 [1.6-5.9]). DSM-IV depression criteria were fulfilled by 26% of the students and were associated with poor sleep patterns. Energy drinks use was associated with poor sleep quality. Discussion: Poor sleep quality, daytime sleepiness and depressive symptoms are frequent among medical students and are associated with lower academic performance. The identification of students at risk and the implementation of targeted interventions are warranted.

This study aimed to investigate the impact of SES on diet quality and body mass index in Latin America. Data from the ""Latin American Health and Nutrition Study (ELANS)"", a multi-country, population-based study of 9218 participants, were used. Dietary intake was collected through two 24 h recalls from participants of Argentina, Brazil, Chile, Colombia, Costa Rica, Ecuador, Peru and Venezuela. Diet quality was assessed using the dietary quality score (DQS), the dietary diversity score (DDS) and the nutrients adequacy ratio (NAR). Chi-squared and multivariate-variance analyses were used to estimate possible associations. We found that participants from the low SES consumed less fruits, vegetables, whole grains, fiber and fish and seafood and more legumes than those in the high SES. Also, the diet quality level, assessed by DQS, DDS and NAR mean, increased with SES.

Colombia, a country with growing prevalence of obesity, is considering implementing a similar policy. The objective of this study was to assess perceptions and reactions to different warning designs. We conducted a randomized experiment in an online panel of adults age > 18y (n = 1997). Participants were randomized to view one of four labels: a control label (barcode), an octagon warning, a circle warning, and a triangle warning. Participants viewed their randomly assigned label on a series of products and answered questions (continuous outcomes ranged from 1-4). Compared to the control, all warnings led to higher perceived message effectiveness (increase in mean from 1.79 in the control to 2.59-2.65 in the warning conditions, p < 0.001), a higher percentage of participants who correctly identified products high in nutrients of concern (from 48% in the control condition to 84-89% in the warning conditions, p < 0.001), and reduced intentions to purchases these products (decrease in mean from 2.59 to 1.99-2.01 in the warning conditions, p < 0.001). Relative to the control, warnings performed similarly across education levels, suggesting this policy would be equitable in Colombia. Looking at differences by warning type, the pattern of results suggested that the octagon warnings performed best. After viewing all label types, 49% of participants selected the octagon warning as the one that most discouraged them from consuming products high in nutrients of concern, while 21% and 27% selected the circle and triangle warning.

Methods A systematic search in Medline, Embase, and BIREME was performed. Drug utilization studies including LA countries and comparing drug exposure data on volume were included. The data validity was judged independently by two authors as having low, medium, high, or unclear risk of bias. Results Out of 1191 articles, 25 were kept for full text reading. Finally, five studies were selected. Eight different Latin American countries were involved in the comparisons. The selected studies analyzed wholesale data from a private research company collecting information from the private healthcare sector. In three studies, a high risk of bias in the extrapolation method applied was identified. In one study, a risk of data collection bias was detected. The most frequent limitation detected by the original authors was related to the unavailability of information from the public sector in LA. Conclusion Drug utilization studies comparing data cross-nationally are scarce in LA. In general, validity of the comparisons is hampered by a potential risk of extrapolation bias given the lack of available data on drug consumption from the public healthcare sector.

The mitochondrial genetic diversity levels were very high in this cat species and therefore similar to other Neotropical cats. Nonetheless, the number of significantly different molecular clusters did not align well with putative morphological subspecies. We detected three possible molecular subspecies: P. y. yagouaroundi (wide distribution in Central and South America), P. y. melantho (Central Andean, and their inter-valleys, Peruvian area) and P. y. eyra (Paraguay and northern Argentina). There were also small geographical clusters with no correspondence with the morphological subspecies, especially in Costa Rica, northern and eastern Colombia, and Pacific trans-Andean Colombia and Ecuador. Thus, the number of molecular subspecies in jaguarundi could be less than the number defined morphologically. However, well-differentiated mitochondrial lineages could exist in the area of the putative P. y. panamensis and correspond to undescribed subspecies. The temporal split of the ancestors of the puma and jaguarundi and the initial mitochondrial diversification within the jaguarundi occurred during the late Pliocene, but the major fraction of haplotype proliferation happened during the Pleistocene. All the procedures we used detected a strong population expansion for the jaguarundi during the Gunz-Mindel interglacial period of the Pleistocene. The spatial genetic analyses showed that the isolation-by-distance patterns are not well developed in this species. In contrast, we detected a very significant circular dine with spatial autocorrelation. Therefore, from a molecular perspective some of the individuals far removed from each other geographically are also very similar. This new information may be very helpful to conservation ecologists and managers of jaguarundi habitats as we continue to improve our understanding of the evolutionary history of this cat species.

In doing so, we are able to identify ways in which there is a Latin American model (or at least identifiable patterns) of public affairs education in sharp contrast to what might be expected in terms of emulation of international programs, particularly from the United States and Europe. As the basis for our analysis, we rely on three main sources of information. We use extensive data gathered from a survey of nearly 50 programs of public affairs in Latin America, which we administered in 2015 in order to identify patterns and trends in public affairs education in the region. Then, we compare our data with two data bases: (1) the Atlas of Public Policy and Management (Carleton University and the University of Toronto), which provides an international profile of programs, and (2) NASPAA's Data Center, which summarizes the characteristics of NASPAA-member programs based on Annual Survey data. This comparison allows us to establish to what degree there is a phenomenon of isomorphism in public affairs education between countries in Latin America and similar programs in North America.

It has led to the development of interdisciplinary work, moving from activities from isolated fields (such as biology, psychology or neurology) to research that involves different scientific perspectives. In developing regions, such as Latin America, it has additional challenges, related to available funding and infrastructure. Aim: To analyze key factors in scientific productivity in neurosciences in Latin America. Methods: A bibliometric analysis of the scientific productivity in neurosciences in main five Latin American countries (Argentina, Brazil, Chile, Colombia and Mexico) was carried out. Results: Brazil was the largest producer of scientific articles, and receptor of citations, in neurosciences in 1998-2017, followed by Mexico.

Randomized clinical trials have identified successful strategies in T2D prevention. However, translating these results to real-life scenarios and adapting to ethnocultural differences is a major challenge. Transculturalization allows incorporating cultural factors to diabetes prevention strategies to optimize implementation of clinical trials results. The purpose of this paper is to review the transcultural adaptations developed for T2D prevention in Latin America (LA). METHODS A comprehensive literature review spanning 1960-2016 was performed, using"" Diabetes,""""Latin America,""""Prevention,""""Screening,"" and ""Tools"" as key words. RESULTS Two major tasks are underway in LA: adaptation of screening tools for high-risk individuals, and implementation of diabetes prevention programs. The Finnish Diabetes Risk Score (FINDRISC) is the most widely used screening tool to detect new cases of T2D and people with prediabetes, and it has been adapted (LA-FINDRISC) to include the waist circumference cutoff values appropriate for LA population (>= 94 cm for men and >= 90 cm for women). The validation of the LA-FINDRISC performance depends on the local characteristics. A LA-FINDRISC score >10 may be the best cutoff to identify individuals with impaired glucose regulation in population-based studies, but a higher score (>12-14) might be more appropriate in a clinical setting. A shorter version of the FINDRISC using only the 4 variables with highest impact has been developed and validated in Colombia (ColDRISC). The translation of the Diabetes Prevention Program study in a Latino population in Venezuela found a significant improvement in cardiometabolic risk factors. An adaptation of the Diabetes Prevention Study in the DEMOJUAN study in Barranquilla, Colombia, reduced 2-hour postload glucose.

In 2001, the March of Dimes launched a series of biennial assemblies called the International Conference on Birth Defects and Disabilities in the Developing World (ICBD). The latest ICBD, in 2017, convened in Bogota, Colombia, and was attended by over 300 professionals, policymakers, and donors. The conference attendees, a majority of whom were from LAC, supported a call to action in the form of a consensus statement. The consensus statement lists key actions for maximizing birth defects surveillance, prevention, and care in LAC: 1) improving surveillance; 2) reducing risks for birth defects; 3) fortifying staple foods; 4) preventing and treating infections associated with birth defects; 5) implementing newborn screening; 6) providing care and services for people with birth defects and disabilities; 7) involving governments, civil society, and international agencies; and 8) advancing research for birth defects. Implementation and scale-up of evidence-based interventions using multisectoral and multidisciplinary collaborative approaches were endorsed. LAC countries can leverage technology and social media to advance and advocate for approaches identified in the consensus statement. The consensus statement can be used as a guide by both governments and nongovernmental agencies to take immediate steps for improving the quality of life of those living with birth defects and associated disabilities in the LAC countries.",Article,"Zarante, I.; Hurtado-Villa, P.; Walani, S.R.; Kancherla, V.; Camelo, J.L.; Giugliani, R.; Groisman, B.; Howson, C.P.; Duran, P.",Congenital abnormalities; epidemiology; medical care; neonatal screening; prenatal diagnosis; primary prevention; surveillance; Latin America; West Indies,Congenital abnormalities;epidemiology;medical care;neonatal screening;prenatal diagnosis;primary prevention;surveillance;Latin America;West Indies,Colombia;United States;Argentina;Brazil;Uruguay,2-s2.0-85077929192

Research shows that child maltreatment increases the risk for substance use and problems. Thus, recognition of this relationship may have important implications for substance demand reduction strategies, including efforts to prevent and treat substance use and related problems. Latin America and the Caribbean is a rich and diverse region of the world with a large range of social and cultural influences. To date, relatively little work has addressed the link between child maltreatment and substance use in the region. A working group constituted by the Inter-American Drug Abuse Control Commission (CICAD) and the Centre for Addiction and Mental Health (CAMH) in June, 2010 identified this area as a priority area for a multinational research partnership. This paper summarizes existing information on drug use and child maltreatment in six participating countries, Colombia, El Salvador, Jamaica, Nicaragua, Panama and Uruguay, and considers the implications of child maltreatment prevention for demand reduction strategies to address substance use issues.

In this article, we explain the need to study the situated reality — historically, geographically and politically — of the individuals and groups that fit into this category of the peasantry. The issue concerning peasants is a pressing one in view of the current economic, political and socio-environmental crisis affecting large sectors of the Latin American population. This crisis is due, among other dynamics, to the advance of extractivism, the exacerbation of inequality, environmental deterioration, the dispossession of marginalized communities, and criminalization of the social movement. In order to further the critical analysis of this issue, from a historical, spatial, relational, and political perspective, we will delve into recent conceptualizations of the peasant, and into how political subjects and spatialities are mutually constructed.",Article,"Devine, Jennifer.; Ojeda, Diana.; Garzon, Soraya Maite Yie",Latin America;Peasantry;Peasants;Politics;Space;Territory,Latin America;Peasantry;Peasants;Politics;Space;Territory,Colombia;Colombia;United States,

Methods: This cross-sectional study involved 9218 participants (15–65 years) from the Latin American Study of Nutrition and Health, which included a nationally representative sample of eight countries. All participants completed the International Physical Activity Questionnaire-Long Form for measure walking and cycling for transport and the Neighborhood Environment Walkability Scale-Abbreviated. Furthermore, perceived proximity from home to public open spaces and shopping centers was assessed. Results: Perceived land use mix-access (OR: 1.32; 95%CI: 1.16,1.50) and the existence of many alternative routes in the neighbourhood (1.09 1.01,1.17) were associated with higher odds of reporting any walking for transport (≥10 min/week). Perceived slow speed of traffic (1.88 1.82,1.93) and few drivers exceeding the speed limits (1.92; 1.86,1.98) were also related to higher odds of reporting any walking for transport. The odds of reporting any cycling for transport (≥10 min/week) were higher in participants perceiving more walking/cycling facilities (1.87 1.76,1.99), and better aesthetics (1.22 1.09,1.38).

How citizens, academics, and leaders explain climate-related risk and disasters in Latin America and the Caribbean","For decades, social scientists have attempted to reveal the real causes behind disasters. While some scholars have recently focused almost exclusively on people's vulnerabilities, the majority recognize that disasters result from a combination of people's choices and hazards. Agencies and government officials, on the other hand, have often downplayed the political component of disasters (particularly those linked to global warming), preferring to focus on the technical and managerial aspects of climate response. This study explores how activists in informal settlements, academics, and governments in the Global South explain climate-related risk and disasters. The study is based on interviews, workshops, and group meetings in Haiti, Cuba, Chile, and Colombia, and on a fouryear analysis of implementation activities where community leaders were given financial resources to create risk reduction initiatives. Results show that there are significant mismatches between understandings of climate effects by people in informal settlements and decision-makers. Besides, whereas some scholars tend to focus on an anthropocentric view of risk and consider climate a component of ""the hazard,"" residents perceive it as a factor of their vulnerability and a threat to their territories and ecosystems. These results challenge some popular definitions of climate risk and suggest that modern epistemologies of disasters are inappropriate to set up effective risk reduction in the Global South.

However, in most cases, large-scale measures failed to be implemented and the transmission of MRSA has since led to a global pandemic. Presently, doubts still remain about the best approach to prevent and control MRSA and more often than not, control measures are not implemented. Therefore, we review here the current situation in Latin America with respect to existing policies for control of MRSA, and evaluate the evidence for control measures in hospitals and the community. We look at the risk factors for infection and transmission of MRSA between hospital patients and within specific populations in the community, and at the effect of antibiotic usage on the spread of MRSA in these settings. Finally, we summarize recommendations for the prevention and control of MRSA, which can be applied to the Latin American hospital environment and community setting.",Article,"Alvarez, C.; Labarca, J.; Salles, M.",MRSA; prevention; infection control; Latin America,MRSA;prevention;infection control;Latin America;HEALTH-CARE WORKERS;ACTIVE SURVEILLANCE CULTURES;INFECTION-CONTROL;CLOSTRIDIUM-DIFFICILE;ANTIBIOTIC EXPOSURE;HOSPITAL ADMISSION;ANTIMICROBIAL USE;RISK-FACTORS;CONTAMINATION;STRAINS,Colombia;Chile;Brazil,2-s2.0-78650808591

In Colombia, there have been major legislative pushes for SSB taxes and FOP labels, although neither has passed to date. In light of the ongoing policy debate and successful implementation of similar policies in Peru and Chile, we explored manufacturer reformulation in the Colombian food supply. We compared the quantities of nutrients of concern (including sugar, sodium, and saturated fat) from the nutrition facts panels of the same 102 packaged foods and 36 beverages from the top-selling brands in Colombia between 2016 and 2018. Our analyses showed a substantial decrease in median sugar content of beverages, from 9.2 g per 100 mL to 5.2 g per 100 mL, and an increase in the percentage of beverages containing non-nutritive sweeteners (NNS), from 33% to 64% (p = 0.003). No meaningful changes in the quantities of nutrients of concern among foods were observed.

However, they are normally assessed as present or absent. We challenge this assumption by considering them as fuzzy sets where membership scores range from 0 to 1, because, in real situations, the design principles can be present at a certain level. We define categories to assess the level of membership and apply it to a single case study analysing how changes in water policy can affect the community-based management of the Water User Association of Mondomo (Colombia). In rural areas of Colombia, most water and sanitation services are provided by water user associations, wherein civil society has developed governance systems based on active citizen involvement and community-based management. Some of these associations have been operating for decades and are essential pillars of the local social fabric. However, recent changes in the country's policy and legal framework threaten these long-lasting governance systems. The results show that most of the design principles would suffer important changes that undermine the governance system.

Methods: Data from the ELANS study, an observational multi-country study (n: 8336; 18-65 years), were used. Active transportation (walking and cycling) and leisure time physical activity was assessed using the International Physical Activity Questionnaire (long version). The obesity indicators considered were: body mass index, and waist and neck circumference. Results: In the total sample, the average time dedicated to active transportation was 24.3 min/day, with the highest amount of active transportation being Costa Rica (33.5 min/day), and the lowest being Venezuela (15.7 min/day). The countries with the highest proportion of active transportation were Ecuador (71.9%), and the lowest was Venezuela (40.5%). Results from linear regression analyses suggest that active transportation was significantly and independently associated with a lower body mass index (beta: -0.033; 95% CI: -0.064; -0.002), but not with waist circumference (beta: -0.037; 95% CI: -1.126; 0.390 and neck circumference (beta: -0.007; 95% CI: -0.269; 0.130).

Early and accurate diagnosis of the disease, though currently lacking in clinics, is integral to enable timely care and epidemiological response. We developed a dual detection system: a CHIKV antigen E1/E2-based enzyme-linked immunosorbent assay (ELISA) and a lateral flow test using high-affinity anti-CHIKV antibodies. The ELISA was validated with 100 PCR-tested acute Chikungunya fever samples from Honduras. The assay had an overall sensitivity and specificity of 51% and 96.67%, respectively, with accuracy reaching 95.45% sensitivity and 92.03% specificity at a cycle threshold (Ct) cutoff of 22. As the Ct value decreased from 35 to 22, the ELISA sensitivity increased. We then developed and validated two lateral flow tests using independent antibody pairs. The sensitivity and specificity reached 100% for both lateral flow tests using 39 samples from Colombia and Honduras at Ct cutoffs of 20 and 27, respectively.

Using the LA-FINDRISC, the best cut-offs to detect uT2D were 9 in men and 10 in women and to detect IGT was 9 in both genders. Conclusion: LA-FINDRISC has similar performance than O-FINDRISC in Venezuelan adults and showed a good performance to detect uT2D and IGT, but not IFG. The best cut-offs to detect glucose alterations were established. (C) 2019 Primary Care Diabetes Europe. Published by Elsevier Ltd.

The aim of this study was to establish the association of maternal, family, and contextual correlates of anthropometric typologies at the household level in Colombia using 2005 Demographic Health Survey (DHS/ENDS) data. Methods. Household-level information from mothers 18-49 years old and their children <5 years old was included. Stunting and overweight were assessed for each child. Mothers were classified according to their body mass index. Four anthropometric typologies at the household level were constructed: normal, underweight, overweight, and dual burden. Four three-level [households (n = 8598) nested within municipalities (n = 226), nested within states (n = 32)] hierarchical polytomous logistic models were developed. Household log-odds of belonging to one of the four anthropometric categories, holding 'normal' as the reference group, were obtained. Results. This study found that anthropometric typologies were associated with maternal and family characteristics of maternal age, parity, maternal education, and wealth index. Higher municipal living conditions index was associated with a lower likelihood of underweight typology and a higher likelihood of overweight typology. Higher population density was associated with a lower likelihood of overweight typology. Conclusion.

Three highly effective vaccines are available to prevent human papillomavirus (HPV) infection, and they have been introduced in many countries around the world. This article describes advances and challenges in introducing HPV vaccines in the Expanded Program of Immunization (EPL) of countries in Latin America and the Caribbean (LAC). Methods. We reviewed national and regional sources of information to identify LAC countries with and without universal HPV vaccination, along with the year of introduction, type of HPV vaccine, vaccination scheme, age groups targeted, and coverage level reached. Incidence rates of cervical cancer were compared across countries with and without an HPV vaccination program, in order to identify inequities in access to HPV vaccines. Results. So far, 10 LAC countries have supplied data on their vaccination policies and vaccination coverage rates to the Pan America Health Organization. The majority of those 10 started their vaccination programs using quadrivalent vaccine. Only Chile, Ecuador, and Mexico started their programs using a two-dose scheme. However, by the end of 2016, most of the other countries had switched from a three-dose to a two-dose scheme. Different age groups are targeted in the various programs. Some countries vaccinate one-year birth cohorts, while others vaccinate multiple-year birth cohorts. By the end of 2014, coverage with at least two doses ranged from a low of 2% to a high of 86%. With the exception of Venezuela, the LAC countries with the largest populations introduced universal HPV vaccination between 2010 and 2014. Despite the progress that has occurred in some LAC countries, there are still 10 LAC nations with cervical cancer rates above the LAC average (21.2 cases per 100 000) that have not introduced an HPV vaccine in their EPI. Conclusions. With several key adjustments, HPV vaccination programs across Latin America and the Caribbean could be substantially strengthened. Ongoing monitoring of HPV infection outcomes is needed in order to assess the impact of different vaccination policies.",Article,"Restrepo, F.D.; Guzman, N.A.; Gomez, A.D.; Ruiz, C.",Papillomavirus vaccines; health policy; health services research; program evaluation; immunization programs; West Indies; Latin America,Papillomavirus vaccines;health policy;health services research;program evaluation;immunization programs;West Indies;Latin America;CERVICAL-CANCER;PROGRAMS;LEVEL,Colombia;United States,2-s2.0-85071741909

This is particularly important in Latin American countries because they present the highest burden of non-communicable diseases relative to other worldwide regions. This study aimed to examine the patterns of active transportation and its association with sociodemographic inequities in Latin American countries. Methods: This cross-sectional study was conducted in eight countries. Participants (n = 8547, 18-65 years) self-reported their active transportation (walking, cycling, and total) using the International Physical Activity Questionnaire. Sex, age, ethnicity, socioeconomic level, education level, public and private transport use, and transport mode were used as sociodemographic inequities. Results: Participants spent a total of 19.9, 3.1, and 23.3 min/day with walking, cycling, and total active transportation, respectively. Mixed and other ethnicity (Asian, Indigenous, Gypsy, and other), high socioeconomic level as well as middle and high education level presented higher walking than Caucasian, low socioeconomic and education level.

This is particularly true in Colombia. There, the number of individuals with dementia may increase five-fold by 2050. Yet research is lacking on dementia in such settings. This work estimates the prevalence of dementia in a community-dwelling population in Colombia. It also assesses how gender-based differences in cardiovascular conditions and socioeconomic disparities affect dementia. This work analyzes data on 2000 respondents at least 60 years of age in the Health, Well-Being, And Aging (SABE) study in Bogota. Respondents with dementia are those who have cognitive impairment and at least two limitations in instrumental activities of daily living. The SABE study finds 8.4% of respondents have dementia. Age, cardiovascular risks, and socioeconomic disparities contributed to higher odds of dementia. The contributors to dementia can differ for men and women. For example, socioeconomic disparities were a larger contributor to dementia for women than men. The findings support the cognitive reserve hypothesis on dementia. This holds that pre-existing cognitive processes and compensatory mechanisms influence dementia. Women in Latin America are more likely to suffer from socioeconomic disparities that limit their cognitive reserve. This research points to several policy implications that can help offset these disparities and reduce the prevalence of dementia.",Article,"Mejia-Arango, S.; Garcia-Cifuentes, E.; Samper-Ternent, R.; Borda, M.G.; Cano-Gutierrez, C.A.",Colombia; Dementia; Gender-based; Gender disparity; Latin America; Socioeconomic disparity,Colombia;Dementia;Gender-based;Gender disparity;Latin America;Socioeconomic disparity;MONTREAL COGNITIVE ASSESSMENT;ALZHEIMERS-DISEASE;INSTRUMENTAL ACTIVITIES;CARDIOVASCULAR HEALTH;SEX-DIFFERENCES;SCREENING TOOL;LATIN-AMERICA;AIR-POLLUTION;PREVALENCE;ASSOCIATION,Mexico;Colombia;United States;Norway,2-s2.0-85096864139

Twelve lysimeters were installed in Bogota, Colombia (2,600 m.a.s.l.). Two parameters were evaluated to determine the effect on EVP rate as follows: (a) the plant's age at the plantation time (one year or six months), and (b) the type of water (domestic wastewater or fertilized water). The plant's age was the most important parameter influencing the EVP rate. In addition, the growth of plants was similar (p > 0.05) between individuals irrigated with domestic wastewater and fertilized water. Thus, Salix humboldtiana over one-year-old was recommended to be used in EWS because its EVP rate of 1456 mm y(-1), can treat 372 mm y(-1) of domestic wastewater under the highland climate conditions. Finally, one EWS planted with Salix humboldtiana to treat domestic wastewater for a Colombian family located in these climate conditions would need an area of 400 m(2).

Objectives: The data collected from SISPRO were used to analyse the prevalence and specific characteristics of patients with IBD and related arthritis registered between 2012 and 2016. Methods: This is a descriptive epidemiological study using the International Statistical Classification of Diseases and Related Health Problem as keywords related to IBD and related arthritis during the analysis of SISPRO data. Results: National records report 42,647 patients with a diagnosis of IBD for an estimated prevalence of 87/100,000 subjects, being more frequent in women. The prevalence of Crohn's disease was 17/100,000 subjects, and 113/100,000 subjects for ulcerative colitis. The prevalence of arthritis related to inflammatory bowel disease was 5/100,000 subjects. Conclusions: This is the first study that describes the demographic characteristics of IBD in Colombia. This study is in accordance with that previously described in the available literature, which supports the theory about increasing global prevalence of IBD. Also, there are some differences between Colombian regions, which could be related to environmental factors and ancestry, which deserve further study.",Article,"Fernandez-Avila, D.

These centers facilitate the training of different professionals, as well as the research at basic, translational and clinical levels. Nevertheless, few reports have described the experience of these centers and their local and/or global impact in the study of IEM. In this paper, we describe the experience of a Colombian reference center for the research, diagnosis, training and education on IEM. During the last 20 years, important advances have been achieved in the clinical knowledge of these disorders, as well as in the local availability of several diagnosis tests. Organic acidurias have been the most frequently detected diseases, followed by aminoacidopathies and peroxisomal disorders. Research efforts have been focused in the production of recombinant proteins in microorganisms towards the development of new enzyme replacement therapies, the design of gene therapy vectors and the use of bioinformatics tools for the understanding of IEM. In addition, this center has participated in the education and training of a large number professionals at different levels, which has contributed to increase the knowledge and divulgation of these disorders along the country.

Results from the ELANS Study,"Latin American (LA) women have been exposed to demographic and epidemiologic changes that have transformed their lifestyle, with increasing sedentary and unhealthy eating behaviors. We aimed to identify characteristics of LA women to inform public policies that would benefit these women and their future children. The Latin American Study of Nutrition and Health (ELANS) is a multicenter cross-sectional study of representative samples in eight Latin American countries (n = 9218) with a standardized protocol to investigate dietary intake, anthropometric variables, physical activity, and socioeconomic characteristics. Here we included the subsample of all 3254 women of childbearing age (15 to <45 years). The majority of ELANS women had a low socioeconomic status (53.5%), had a basic education level (56.4%), had a mostly sedentary lifestyle (61.1%), and were overweight or obese (58.7%). According to the logistic multiple regression model, living in Peru and Ecuador predicts twice the risk of being obese, and an increased neck circumference is associated with a 12-fold increased obesity risk. An increased obesity risk was also predicted by age <19 years (Relative Risk (RR) 19.8) and adequate consumption of vitamin D (RR 2.12) and iron (RR 1.3).

On the other hand, the conflicts in Latin America and the Caribbean are often overlooked in the academic literature, which focuses on studying the major Western economies and the great Asian tigers, given their political, economic and military value; for this reason, consumer animosity studies are mostly conducted in these countries. This study seeks to contribute to the scarce literature on consumer animosity in Latin America, through a current conflict between two South American countries, such as Colombia and Venezuela. The data processed through the PLS, allow us to demonstrate how the Colombian consumer, although he may have animosity towards Venezuela, has a positive image of the fast-food restaurants of Venezuelan origin in Colombia.

The target sample included 9 000 individuals, 15-65 years of age, and was stratified by geographic location (only urban areas), gender, age, and socioeconomic status. Six principal challenges were identified: team structuring and site selections; developing a single protocol; obtaining ethic approvals; completing simultaneous fieldwork; ensuring data quality; and extracting data and maintaining consistency across databases. Lessons learned show that harmonization, pilot study, uniformity of procedures, high data quality control, and communication and collaboration across sites are imperative. Barriers included organizational complexity, recruitment of collaborators and research staff, institutional cooperation, development of infrastructure, and identification of resources. Consensus on uniform measures and outcomes and data collection methodology, as well as a plan for data management and analysis, communication, publication, and dissemination of study results should be in place prior to beginning fieldwork.

This article identifies the factors that indexed on the acquisition of skills in Latin America. For this purpose, the information of the eight Latin American countries participating in Programme for International Student Assessment 2012 is employed. As the base in question containing missing data, the method nonparametric hot-deck imputation was applied. Using a hierarchical linear model with random predictor, on two levels, to analyze the PISA 2012 for the Latin American countries results we found that the main determinants of school performance are gender, condition of not repeater and quality of school materials. In addition, it was determined that the variability in skills acquisition is explained, in a smaller proportion, by the heterogeneity in the characteristics of the students.

The region's health systems are deeply fragmented, which poses great challenges to overall equity levels in health. This is also one of the fastest ageing regions in the world, with increasing demands as well for acute and long-term care (LTC). Demographic and epidemiological transitions across the region are heterogeneous. In this context, health systems are in general, largely unprepared to face the challenge of promoting healthy ageing. This unpreparedness has been magnified by the Coronavirus disease-2019 pandemic. Here, we analyse the burden of disease in the older population and identify priorities to improve the care and quality of life for people living in LAC. Besides an adequately prepared workforce, we must remediate disparities and inequities; develop and implement integrated care; achieve patient-centred care and further develop palliative and end-of-life care; simultaneously, we must develop the structure and financing of LTC services and strengthen the role of public health making healthy ageing an essential component.",Review,"Robledo, Luis Miguel Guti Crossed D.Sign(c)Rrez.; Unknown.; Unknown",ageism;geriatrics;health services;Latin America;older people,ageism;geriatrics;health services;Latin America;older people,Colombia;United States;Mexico,

To this end, we studied the Pacific Alliance (PA) and employed an ordered probit model with sample selection bias and statistical information from the Global Entrepreneurship Monitor (GEM) database for the 2012-2017 period. As a dependent variable, we used the growth aspiration of entrepreneurs as a proxy to measure the future growth of the company, from which a possible economic impact could be inferred. The evidence shows that during the implementation period of the PA, there is a positive impact on entrepreneur growth aspirations in member countries; the likelihood that entrepreneurs have high-growth aspirations is found to be greater during and after the implementation period than before the signing of the PA. Likewise, it was found that motivation, gender, education, skills, innovation (as perceived by the entrepreneur), export level, two pillars of the global competitiveness index (GCI), and the gross domestic product (GDP) growth rate explain the growth aspirations of entrepreneurs in the member countries during the period under study.",Article,"Castro, R.P.; Mora, J.U.M.; Laverde, F.P.",entrepreneurship; growth aspirations; Latin America; international alliances; gem; regional development,entrepreneurship;growth aspirations;Latin America;international alliances;gem;regional development;DETERMINANTS;MOTIVATION;MONITOR,Colombia,2-s2.0-85083572502

Low vitamin E intake during early pregnancy associates with congenital malformations and embryonic loss in animals and with miscarriage and intrauterine growth restriction in humans. Vitamin E protects cell membranes from lipoperoxidation and exerts non-antioxidant activities. Its function can be restored by vitamin C; thus, intake and circulating levels of both micronutrients are frequently analyzed together. Although substantial vitamin E inadequacy was reported worldwide, its consumption in Latin America (LatAm) is mostly unknown. Using data from the Latin American Study of Nutrition and Health (Estudio Latinoamericano de Nutricion y Salud, ELANS), we evaluated vitamin E and C intake in women of reproductive age (WRA) from eight LatAm countries and identified their main food sources. Two non-consecutive 24-h dietary recalls in 3704 women aged from 15 to 49 years and living in urban locations showed low average intake of vitamin E (7.9 mg/day vs. estimated average requirement (EAR) of 12 mg/day) and adequate overall vitamin C consumption (95.5 mg/day vs. EAR of 60 mg/day). The mean regional inadequacy was 89.6% for vitamin E and 36.3% for vitamin C. The primary food sources of vitamin E were fats and oils, as well as vegetables. Vitamin C intake was explained mainly by the consumption of fruit juices, fruits, and vegetables. Combined deficient intake of both vitamins was observed in 33.7% of LatAm women. Although the implications of low antioxidant vitamins' consumption in WRA are still unclear, the combined deficient intake of both vitamins observed in one-third of ELANS participants underscores the need for further research on this topic.",Article,"Busso, D.; David, A.; Penailillo, R.; Echeverria, G.; Rigotti, A.; Kovalskys, I.; Gomez, G.; Sanabria, L.Y.C.; Garcia, M.C.Y.; Pareja, R.G.; Herrera-Cuenca, M.; Fisberg, M.",women of reproductive age; Latin America; intake; vitamin E; vitamin C,women of reproductive age;Latin America;intake;vitamin E;vitamin C;TOCOPHEROL TRANSFER PROTEIN;ALPHA-TOCOPHEROL;E SUPPLEMENTATION;PREGNANT-WOMEN;E-DEFICIENCY;FOOD;REQUIREMENTS;INTERVENTION;PREVALENCE;PROFILE,Chile;Argentina;Costa Rica;Colombia;Ecuador;Peru;Venezuela;Brazil,2-s2.0-85107297669

This study aimed to characterize total and whole grain intake in Latin American countries and to investigate foods contributing to these intake in the region. Methods Data were obtained from the multicenter cross-sectional survey Latin American Study of Nutrition and Health (ELANS), including 9128 participants residing in urban areas of eight Latin American countries. Data collection was performed via two household visits using a standardized questionnaire and two 24 h dietary recalls. Usual dietary intake of total grain foods and foods containing whole grains was estimated. The association between the intake of grain food groups and sociodemographic variables was investigated using multiple linear regression models with random intercepts. Results Mean intake of total grain foods and foods containing whole grains was 318.6 g/d and 14.7 g/d, respectively. Total grain foods were less consumed by participants at older ages (-9.8 g/d), and females (-9.9 g/d), and more consumed by those in the lowest socioeconomic category (24.8 g/d). Foods containing whole grains were more consumed by participants at older ages (3.3 g/d), and females (4.0 g/d), while those in the lowest socioeconomic category consumed 2.9 g/d less. Major contributors to energy provided from foods containing whole grains were oatmeal, masa harina, whole-wheat bread, corn chips, and wheat crackers.

This study aimed to compare the disease outcomes of patients with RA, based on their healthcare regime affiliation. Methods A retrospective observational study of Colombian patients with RA in three outpatient services of different regimes: Contributory (CR, workers and their families with a monthly income above a yearly defined threshold, approximately US$ 220, who allocate a percentage of their income to financing the national health fund and to get access to healthcare services), subsidized (SR, a vulnerable population with a monthly income below the threshold, who have access to healthcare through the national health fund; comparable to the USA Medicaid population), and an excellence clinical care center (C3, access to specialized care, regardless of their healthcare affiliation regime). Data were collected from clinical records for 2 years of follow-up and included demographics, lag times between appointments, and time in high disease activity. We used the Mantel-Cox test for the analysis of time to remission/low disease activity. Results A total of 240 patients were included (80 patients per regime). At the start of follow-up, mean age was 53.7 years; 21.6% of patients were men; 79.6% of patients had established RA; 72.9% of patients had high disease activity. Patients in the CR had longer lag times between scheduled appointments (p < 0.0001). During follow-up, SR had the highest proportion of patients with high disease activity. Survival curve analysis showed no significant difference between SR and CR groups (p = 0.2903), but was significantly different compared with the C3 group (p < 0.0001). Median survival in high disease activity was greater in the SR group (293 days), followed by CR (254 days), and finally by C3 (64 days).

The study included 1,135 participants of Bogota and Barranquilla that presented a high risk of developing T2D according to the Finnish Diabetes Risk Score (>12 points) and who underwent an oral glucose tolerance test. The main outcome variable was the level of physical activity assessed by the International Physical Activity Questionnaire. Unadjusted and adjusted logistic regression analysis were used to calculate odds ratios (OR) and the corresponding 95% confidence intervals (CI). Results: In total, 72.5% of the study participants had low level of physical activity. Participants in the age group between 45 and 54 years showed 74% greater odds of having low physical activity compared with the youngest age group (OR 1.74, 95% CI 1.1 -2.8). People living in Barranquilla were eight times more likely to have low physical activity compared with those in Bogota D.C. (OR 8.1, 95% CI 5.7 to 11.4). Conclusion: A large proportion of the population at risk of developing D2T in two large cities of Colombia have a sedentary lifestyle. Interventions should be designed and implemented in order to increase physical activity in these populations.",Article,"Acosta, T.; Tuesca, R.; Florez, K.; Barengo, N.C.; Anillo, L.; Florez-Garcia, V.; Acosta, J.; Carvajal, L.; de la Rosa, S.; Pachon, M.J.; Aschner, P.",physical activity; risk factors; population; pre-diabetic state; Latin America,physical activity;risk factors;population;pre-diabetic state;Latin America;ACTIVITY QUESTIONNAIRE;RELIABILITY;VALIDITY,Colombia;United States;Finland;Latvia,2-s2.0-85100223801
,,,2,WOS:000460038700006,2019,Fiscal Policy Effects and Capital Mobility in Latin American Countries,"This paper studies the relationship between the size of the fiscal multiplier and the degree of capital mobility in some Latin American countries. Mundell's (1963) and Fleming's (1962) models show that this effect could be very large or small (close to zero) depending on the exchange rate and the degree of capital mobility, and the potency of a fiscal policy is inversely correlated with the degree of capital mobility. Based on Mora's (2013) model, we argue that the multiplier might not be negatively correlated with capital mobility in these countries. In other words, the potency of fiscal policy could be small because the degree of capital mobility in Latin American countries is quite low. The empirical findings support our hypothesis. We have found that the size of the fiscal multiplier tends to increase or (at least) to remain around 1.40 in these countries in the short run; however, in the long run, this effect tends to decrease significantly to 0.34. These results also suggest that the effectiveness of fiscal policies in Latin American countries are still large but could be larger if they become more financially integrated with the rest of the world.",Article,"Mora, J.U.; Acevedo, R.A.",Fiscal policy; Business cycles; Latin America,Fiscal policy;Business cycles;Latin America,Colombia;United States,2-s2.0-85067117919
,,,2,WOS:000808512500001,2022,Historical overview and update on relapsing fever group Borrelia in Latin America,"Relapsing fever group Borrelia (RFGB) are motile spirochetes transmitted to mammalian or avian hosts through the bite of hematophagous arthropods, such as soft ticks (Argasidae), hard ticks (Ixodidae) and the human clothing lice. RFGB can infect pets such as dogs and cats, as well as birds, cattle and humans. Borrelia recurrentis, B. anserina and B. theileri are considered to have worldwide distribution, affecting humans, domestic birds and ruminants, respectively. Borrelia spp. associated with soft ticks are transmitted mainly by Ornithodoros ticks and thrive in endemic foci in tropical and subtropical latitudes. Nowadays, human cases of soft tick-borne relapsing fever remain neglected diseases in several countries, and the impact these spirochetes have on the health of wild and domestic animals is largely understudied. Human infection with RFGB is difficult to diagnose, given the lack of distinguishing clinical features (undifferentiated febrile illness). Clinically, soft tick or louse-borne relapsing fever is often confused with other etiologies, such as malaria, typhoid or dengue. In Latin America, during the first half of the twentieth century historical documents elaborated by enlightened physicians were seminal, and resulted in the identification of RFGB and their associated vectors in countries such as Mexico, Panama, Colombia, Venezuela, Peru and Argentina. Almost 80 years later, research on relapsing fever spirochetes is emerging once again in Latin America, with molecular characterizations and isolations of novel RFGB members in Panama, Bolivia, Brazil and Chile. In this review we summarize historical aspects of RFGB in Latin America and provide an update on the current scenario regarding these pathogens in the region. To accomplish this, we conducted an exhaustive search of all the published literature for the region, including old medical theses deposited in libraries of medical academies. RFGB were once common pathogens in Latin America, and although unnoticed for many years, they are currently the focus of interest among the scientific community. A One Health perspective should be adopted to tackle the diseases caused by RFGB, since these spirochetes have never disappeared and the maladies they cause may be confused with etiologies with similar symptoms that prevail in the region.",Review,"Faccini-Martinez, A.A.; Silva-Ramos, C.R.; Santodomingo, A.M.; Ramirez-Hernandez, A.; Costa, F.B.; Labruna, M.B.; Munoz-Leal, S.",Soft ticks; Ornithodoros; Spirochetes; Tick-borne diseases; Relapsing fever; Borrelia; Clothing lice; Latin America,Soft ticks;Ornithodoros;Spirochetes;Tick-borne diseases;Relapsing fever;Borrelia;Clothing lice;Latin America;ACARI ARGASIDAE;PUERTORICENSIS FOX;TICK;SPIROCHETE;BURGDORFERI;THEILERI;IXODIDA;NEOTROPICALIS;TRANSMISSION;PREVALENCE,Colombia;Chile;Brazil,2-s2.0-85131642911

Still, there is no consensus on their definition across the region. Patients with RDs face a diagnostic odyssey to find a correct diagnosis, which may last many years and creates a burden for caregivers, healthcare systems, and society. These diagnostic delays have repercussions on the health and economic burden created by RDs and continue to represent an unmet medical need. This review analyzes barriers to the widespread adoption of newborn screening (NBS) programs and early diagnostic methods for RDs in Latin America and provides recommendations to achieve this critical objective. Increasing the adoption of NBS programs and promoting early diagnosis of RDs are the first steps to improving health outcomes for patients living with RDs. A coordinated, multistakeholder effort from leaders of patient organizations, government, industry, medical societies, academia, and healthcare services is required to increase the adoption of NBS programs. Patients’ best interests should remain the guiding principle for decisions regarding NBS implementation and early diagnosis for RDs.",Review,"Unknown.; Castillo Taucher, Silvia.; Unknown.; Unknown.; Unknown.; Unknown.; Zarante, Ignacio.; Unknown",diagnostic odyssey;early diagnosis;genetics;genomics;Latin America;molecular diagnosis;newborn screening;rare diseases,diagnostic odyssey;early diagnosis;genetics;genomics;Latin America;molecular diagnosis;newborn screening;rare diseases,Mexico;Colombia;Argentina;Brazil;Brazil;Chile;Panama;Colombia,

In most recent years, China has become a more important geo-economic source of output fluctuations for the region. Furthermore, focusing on export-structure related aspects as mechanisms, evidence suggests that non-primary commodity exporters in Latin America, whose exports have mainly been destined for the US market, display an intensified output fluctuation co-movement with the US.

Studies assessing the prevalence of systemic hypertension in Colombia have included main cities and small regions. However, there is no available data regarding the country as a whole. Objective: To describe the prevalence of systemic hypertension according to reports made to the official information systems in Colombia. Method: The prevalence of systemic hypertension was calculated through the extraction and analysis of data contained within the SISPRO tool, the official information system for the Colombian Ministry of Health and Social Protection. The prevalence was then standardized by age, and for the different geographical regions of the country in the period comprised between years 2013 and 2017. Results: During the five years of follow-up, we located 12,386,343 registries reporting systemic hypertension as a main diagnosis. The lowest prevalence (4.65%) was found in year 2013, and the highest prevalence (5.83%) was found in 2017. The mean national prevalence for patients above the age of 60, during the aforementioned 5-year period, was 28.14%. The prevalence was higher in women, with a women-to-men ratio of 1.78:1. The group with the higher adjusted prevalence during the study period was composed of women above the age of 80 in year 2017, with an adjusted prevalence of 54.4%. The regions with a prevalence over 10% were Risaralda, Caldas, Boyacá. Antioquia and Sucre. Conclusions: The national prevalence of registered consultations due to systemic hypertension to the official information sources is lower than that reported in previous studies conducted on similar populations, suggesting the existence of underreport to said information sources.",Article,"Garcia-Pena, Angel Alberto.; Ospina, Diego.; Unknown.; Fernandez-Avila, D.

In Latin America, the information on the epidemiology of this disease is scarce and records are essential to know its behavior in the populations. In Colombia, the Ministry of Health uses the SISPRO tool to collect information on the unified national health system which offers nearly universal coverage (around 95%). This public information makes it possible to perform epidemiological studies on different diseases. Objectives: Using the SISPRO data corresponding to the years 2012-2016, we analyzed the prevalence and characteristics of patients with systemic sclerosis. Methods: A descriptive cross-sectional study was performed based on the SISPRO data; we used as keywords the diagnoses of the International Classification of Diseases related to the diagnosis of systemic sclerosis. Results: A total of 11,300 individuals diagnosed with systemic sclerosis were documented. The estimated prevalence was 23.7 cases per 100,000 inhabitants (based on a total population of 47,663,162); this disease is more frequent in the age group of 65-69 years in females (77%), and has a female:male ratio of 3.27:1.

Family members are often caregivers for individuals with traumatic brain injury, which can result in significant stress. Research is needed to examine depression and quality of the caregiving relationship in these dyads. This study examined relationship quality and depression longitudinally after traumatic brain injury within the caregiving relationship. Design Dyads (N= 109) composed of individuals with traumatic brain injury and their caregivers were recruited from three hospitals in Mexico and Colombia. They self-reported depression and relationship satisfaction during hospitalization and at 2 and 4 mos after hospitalization. Results A 2-lag Actor Partner Interdependence Model demonstrated that patients and caregivers reporting high relationship satisfaction at baseline experienced lower depression 2 mos later, which then predicted higher caregiver relationship satisfaction at 4 mos. Moreover, patients with high relationship satisfaction at baseline had caregivers with lower depression at 2 mos, which was then associated with patients' higher satisfaction at 4 mos.

This multi-country study utilised a cross-sectional design to collect data on drug abuse, as well as retrospective data on maltreatment during childhood. The sample consisted of 2,283 university students, of which 82.6% reported childhood maltreatment experiences, and 33.5% increased levels of psychological distress. A significant relationship was observed between childhood maltreatment and drug abuse as an adult (p<0.05). Although the sampling technique does not permit generalisations to all university students, the current study identified exposure to childhood maltreatment as a potential precursor to adult drug abuse within the populations studied. Therefore, the effectiveness of drug demand reduction strategies at the respective universities may be enhanced by incorporating policies and interventions aimed at childhood maltreatment.",Article,"Unknown.; Unknown.; Unknown.; Unknown.; Rojas, Juan Daniel Gomez.; Unknown.; Diaz, Eduardo Alfredo Martinez.; Unknown.; Unknown.; Unknown",Child abuse;Latin America;Students;Substance-related disorders;Universities,Child abuse;Latin America;Students;Substance-related disorders;Universities,El Salvador;Nicaragua;Panama;Colombia;Uruguay;Jamaica;Colombia,

Schools and campuses-which used to be spaces for social exchange-had to cease face-toface instruction and shift to remote learning with no prior planning or training, which posed several challenges to education systems around the globe. In Latin America-responsible, today, for over half of the planet's daily COVID-19-related deaths-this scenario is even more dramatic. The diverse socioeconomic levels of the student population is a major challenge for online teaching, as institutions cannot provide computer training, equipment and connectivity to all those in need. In spite of all challenges, universities which are part of AUSJAL (Association of Universities Entrusted to the Society of Jesus in Latin America) are making every effort to offer online classes during this pandemic, since education plays a pivotal role in these countries.

In particular we examine the idea of Humboldt University and its influence on the thinking about the modern university in the West. We conclude that a university reform that seeks to strengthen the political culture, democratization and empowerment of citizens in Latin America, should take into account those ideas of the university that marked its development in the West in the 19th century. That this idea of the university is in crisis could mean that its nature is precisely to be sensitive to the crisis both regarding individuals and society as a whole.

Design/methodology/approach A traditional gravity model is used on a sample composed of high-skilled and low-skilled ethnic networks and multinational enterprises (MNEs) from Latin America, North America and the European Union. Findings Contrary to findings of previous studies, ethnic networks do not appear to influence location decisions of Latin American firms expanding into countries from North America and the European Union. This might be because of weak ethnic connections among the players.

A literature search in PubMed and LILACS was conducted and supplemented with cross-referencing and grey literature. The primary outcome was prevalence of HR-HPV by age as a major determinant of HPV infection. Pooled prevalence and weighted averages were obtained. A random effects meta-analysis conducted for HPV- and HIV-associated factors. In total, 6157 women from 19 cross-sectional studies were included. Weighted prevalence of HR-HPV in WLHIV was 51.0% (95% CI 42.8-59.1, I-2 = 97.4%) with a bimodal trend by age. No association between antiretroviral therapy and HR-HPV prevalence was observed, but low CD4 cell count was associated (PR 1.64, 95% CI 1.07-2.52). Although not significant, a higher HR-HPV prevalence was observed with Hybrid Capture 2 versus PCR. The high prevalence of HR-HPV among WLHIV in LAC underlines the need for improved cervical cancer prevention and early detection in this vulnerable population. Moreover, the high prevalence across age groups, and particularly in young women, deserves careful consideration for defining target populations of HPV-based screening and HPV immunization programs.",Review,"Caicedo-Martinez, M.; Fernandez-Deaza, G.; Ordonez-Reyes, C.; Olejua, P.; Nuche-Berenguer, B.; Mello, M.B.; Murillo, R.",human papillomavirus; HIV; AIDS; uterine cervical neoplasms; Latin America,human papillomavirus;HIV;AIDS;uterine cervical neoplasms;Latin America;CERVICAL-CANCER;POSITIVE WOMEN;HPV INFECTION;HIGH PREVALENCE;LESIONS;COHORT;NEOPLASIA;GENOTYPES;HIV/AIDS,Colombia;United States;France,2-s2.0-85114428665

This article analyzes the interaction between transnational social movements, state institutions and international organizations in the approval and adoption of some of these international norms: the Santiago Declaration, the Durban Declaration and the Inter-American Convention against Racism, Racial Discrimination and Related Forms of Intolerance by the Organization of American States (OAS). Methodology: The information came from interviews conducted with social leaders, public officials and officials of international, the memories of these actors’ speeches at international events, and United Nations, World Bank and OAS documentation. The information was organized and interpreted to delve the participation of each actor in the configuration of international norms for Afro-descendants. Conclusions: The main findings indicate that the specifics of the dynamic relations between those three actors (social movements, state actors and international officials) have triggered the configuration of international norms for Afro-descendants in Latin America. Originality: This findings adds up to previous research that have studied the interactions between Afro-descendant social movements at the national and international level, the effects of international Afro-descendant policy at the domestic level, and the interactions between the state and social movements at the national level. In this scenario, this article offers empirical evidence that has not been considered to contribute to the discussion of the construction of international norms for Afro-descendants, and to deepen the analysis of the impact of Afro-descendant mobilization at transnational level and the role of state and international officials in the construction of norms beyond national borders.",Article,"Echeverri-Pineda, Cristina",Afro-descendants;International norms;Latin America;Multiculturalism;Transnational mobilization,Afro-descendants;International norms;Latin America;Multiculturalism;Transnational mobilization,Colombia,

OBJECTIVE: This study examined whether cognitive dysfunction and social disadaptation in individuals with TBI in Latin America at hospital discharge predict longitudinal trajectories of depression at baseline, 2 months, and 4 months. METHODS: A sample of 109 people with a new TBI was recruited from three hospitals: Mexico City, Mexico, Cali, Colombia and Neiva, Colombia. Participants completed measures of cognitive dysfunction and social disadaptation before hospital discharge and measures of depression at baseline, 2 months, and 4 months. RESULTS: Results suggested that depression scores were found to decrease over time in a quadratic (or U-shaped) fashion, and more significant cognitive dysfunction at hospital discharge was associated with higher longitudinal depression trajectories. Social disadaptation did not exert a unique effect on depression trajectories after controlling for cognitive dysfunction. Depression trajectories changed differentially over time as a function of baseline cognitive dysfunction, such that for those with high cognitive impairment, depression scores started high and then dropped to a moderated range and plateaued, but for individuals with low cognitive dysfunction, depression scores started lower and decreased linearly but moderately. CONCLUSIONS: The results suggest a strong need for neuropsychological assessments and evidence-based cognitive rehabilitation strategies to be implemented immediately after TBI in Latin America, which could exert salubrious effects on depression trajectories over time.",Article,"Cariello, A.N.; Perrin, P.B.; Agudelo, Y.R.; Plaza, S.L.O.; Quijano-Martinez, M.C.; Trujillo, M.A.; Arango-Lasprilla, J.C.",Traumatic brain injury; caregivers; depression; Latin America; rehabilitation,Traumatic brain injury;caregivers;depression;Latin America;rehabilitation;QUALITY-OF-LIFE;QUESTIONNAIRE EBIQ;BEHAVIOR;HEALTH;MODEL;INDIVIDUALS;MILD;IMPAIRMENT,United States;Mexico;Colombia;Spain,2-s2.0-85083312401

However, in most cases, large-scale measures failed to be implemented and the transmission of MRSA has since led to a global pandemic. Presently, doubts still remain about the best approach to prevent and control M RSA and more often than not, control measures are not implemented. Therefore, we review here the current situation in Latin America with respect to existing policies for control of M RSA, and evaluate the evidence for control measures in hospitals and the community. We look at the risk factors for infection and transmission of MRSA between hospital patients and within specific populations in the community, and at the effect of antibiotic usage on the spread of MRSA in these settings.

In areas such as Latin America (LA), addressing BC at national levels evoke discussions surrounding fragmented care, limited resources, and regulatory barriers. Precision Medicine (PM), specifically companion diagnostics (CDx), links disease diagnosis and treatment for better patient outcomes. Thus, its application may aid in overcoming these barriers. Recent findings A panel of LA experts in fields related to BC and PM were provided with a series of relevant questions to address prior to a multi-day conference. Within this conference, each narrative was edited by the entire group, through numerous rounds of discussion until a consensus was achieved. The panel proposes specific, realistic recommendations for implementing CDx in BC in LA and other LMIC regions. In these recommendations, the authors strived to address all barriers to the widespread use and access mentioned previously within this manuscript. Conclusion This manuscript provides a review of the current state of CDx for BC in LA.

This characterization allows prioritizing populations with specific risks, programming the use of health services, and planning the costs necessary to guarantee equitable care. Objective To assess the demographic and clinical characteristics of a cohort of patients with rheumatoid arthritis using national data collected by the High-Cost Disease Fund (CAC in Spanish). Methods A cross-sectional study from a secondary source. Data was gathered from a national administrative registry. A descriptive analysis was performed on sociodemographic and clinical characteristics. Age-standardized prevalence was estimated at national level and by geographical regions. Remission rates were also estimated for Colombian departments and regions. Results By 2019, 81,386 patients with rheumatoid arthritis were reported in Colombia. The relation female-male was 5.2:1. The median age was 59 years (IQR: 50-67). Prevalence was higher in people aged 50-69 years. The most frequent comorbidities were high blood pressure (31.15%) and osteoporosis (19.46%). Age-standardized prevalence of rheumatoid arthritis was 0.24 per 100 population (95% CI: 0.23-0.24). In cases with complete information, 57.57% of departments had remission rates up to 30%.

The objective of this study is to describe and quantify the quantity and quality of the existing TCs in 5 different countries. Design: A multicenter quantitative description of the TCs was conducted in Argentina, Brazil, Colombia, Mexico and Peru. Methods: A survey was realized through the TCs regulatory entities of each country that accepted to participate in the study. Results: Of the 285 TCs identified in the 5 countries, 176 (62%) accepted to participate in this study. The TCs quality vas evaluated according to the scoring system stablished by De Leon, finding that 70% of the facilities have scores of 11/12 or 12/12 using these criteria. We also found that the majority of the De Leon criteria are known by more than 90% of the institutions, however, the dimensions of “separation of the community” and “encounter groups between residents” were the least known with 63 and 85% respectively. The main reasons for abandonment of TCs were “not accepting the rules of the institution” “lack of money” and “not feeling comfortable with the facilities”. 98% of the TCs provided services to other substance abuse problems, 94% for alcohol and 40% for other types of substances. Conclusions: The majority of the TCs identified in our sample meet the quality criteria stablished by De Leon, mostly providing services for substance abuse.

Data from 9218 participants from Argentina, Brazil, Chile, Colombia, Costa Rica, Ecuador, Peru, and Venezuela participating in ""Latin American Health and Nutrition Study (ELANS)"", a multi-country, population-based study, were used. Dietary intake was collected through two, 24 h recalls. Participants were classified into consumers (n = 1073) and non-alcohol consumers (n = 8145) using a cut-off criterium of >= 15 g/day of alcohol consumption calculated from the estimation of their usual daily intake. Among alcohol consumers, the mean alcohol consumption was 69.22 +/- 2.18 grams (4.6. beverages/day), contributing to 484.62 kcal, which corresponded to 16.86% of the total energy intake. We found that the risk of alcohol consumption was higher in young and middle-aged men from low and middle socioeconomic status. Argentine, Brazil, and Chile had the highest percentage of consumers, while Ecuador showed the highest alcohol consumption. Alcohol drinkers were characterized by having higher body weight and wider neck, waist, hips circumferences. Alcohol drinkers had a higher energy intake, with macronutrients providing relatively less energy at the expense of the energy derived from alcohol. Alcohol drinkers showed lower and higher consumptions of healthy and unhealthy food groups, respectively. In addition, adequacy ratios for all micronutrients assessed were lower in alcohol consumers.

Design/methodology/approach: The authors classify individuals according to five categories of increasing entrepreneurial engagement and estimate separate generalized ordered logit models to account for possible gender differences. Compared to previous literature, this is a more efficient methodology that allows us to identify the factors that have a significant and persistent relationship across stages and those that are only significant to specific engagement levels. Findings: The authors find that factors such as parent business ownership, access to loans and autonomy increase the probability of progressing in the entrepreneurial ladder for both men and women and through all the stages. The authors also find that span of activity and the proxy for income increase the likelihood of moving to the next stages only for men, while higher education and autonomy do so only for women. Originality/value: To the best of the authors’ knowledge, this is the first study to identify the factors promoting progress through the different stages of the entrepreneurial ladder in Latin America.

In particular, rental housing in urban informal neighbourhoods has a critical but consistently overlooked role in housing the most vulnerable households in the global South. If better policy and practice are to be pursued, there is a need for improved data on rental housing in urban informal settlements, and in particular, better understanding of 'the lived experiences of the poor'. This article responds to these empirical gaps in debates on informality and rental housing with qualitative research on residents' experiences of informal rented housing in two Colombian cities, Bogota and Cali. The article frames informal rental housing as an essential option for diverse low-income households for whom ownership is not accessible or attractive. In this way, it also contributes to policy and theoretical debates calling for a better understanding of the dynamics, possibilities and potential of informal housing.",Article,"Lombard, M.; Hernandez-Garcia, J.; Angulo, A.L.",housing; informality; rental; Colombia; qualitative; Latin America,housing;informality;rental;Colombia;qualitative;Latin America;HOMEOWNERSHIP;POLICIES;TENANTS;SHELTER,United Kingdom;Colombia,2-s2.0-85110599580

A household-based, multinational, crosssectional survey was conducted in Argentina, Brazil, Chile, Colombia, Costa Rica, Ecuador, Peru, and Venezuela (N=9218; 15-65 years). Contributors to added sugars were identified and listed based on the percentage of contribution to total intake of this nutrient. Data were stratified by country, sex, SEL, and age group, and the grams per day compared. Except in Peru and in the 50 to 65 years age group, soft drinks were the leading contributor to added sugar intake. Homemade beverages together industrialized beverages have been a prominent position on ranking. In general, the highest intake of added sugars by industrialized beverages was from Argentina, and the lowest frequency of beverages as sources of added sugars was observed in Chile. Among the top 10 contributors, male sex had highest added sugar intake, except for sucrose and sweet cakes. Higher intakes of sugars from natural fruit juice and sucrose were observed in the lower SEL. The highest and lowest intakes in the age groups change according to the food source. In conclusion, sugar-sweetened beverages were main contributors to added sugar intake, and the intake vary with geographical location and sociodemographic factors.

However, few studies with representative samples have examined the association between perceived neighborhood safety indicators and domain-specific active transportation in Latin America. This study aimed to examine the associations of perceived neighborhood safety with domain-specific active transportation in adults from eight Latin American countries. Data were obtained from the Latin American Study of Nutrition and Health (n = 8547, aged 18–65). Active transportation (walking and cycling) was assessed using the long form of the International Physical Activity Questionnaire. Specifically, traffic density and speed as well as street lightening, visibility of residents regarding pedestrians and bicyclists, traffic lights and crosswalks, safety of public spaces during the day and at night, crime rate during the day and at night were used to evaluate perceived neighborhood safety. Slow traffic speeds, unsafe public spaces during the day, and crime during the day were associated with ≥10 min/week vs. <10 min/week of walking. Furthermore, drivers exceeding the speed limit and crime rate during the day were associated with reporting ≥10 min/week vs. <10 min/week of cycling.

The Colombian Ministry of Health has adopted the Integrated Information System on Social Protection (Sistema Integrado de Información de la Protección Social, SISPRO, by its Spanish acronym) registry to collect comprehensive information from the Colombian health system. The system provides close to universal coverage (around 95%). We aimed to establish the prevalence of prostate cancer in Colombia and to describe its demographics, based on data provided by SISPRO, openly available for scientific analysis. Methods Using the SISPRO data from 2015 through 2019, we analyzed the prevalence and demographic characteristics of patients diagnosed with prostate cancer. Results We identified a total of 43,862 patients with prostate cancer in the 5-year period and estimated a prevalence of 4.54 cases per 1,000 habitants, using as denominator males over 35 years old. We calculated a prevalence of early-onset prostate cancer (i.e., 35-54 years) of 0.14 per 1,000 habitants (791 cases in 5 years). The highest prevalence was observed in patients > 80 years (33.45 per 1,000 habitants). The departments with the highest prevalence were Bogotá, Valle del Cauca, Risaralda, and Boyacá, and the region with the lowest prevalence was Amazonas. Conclusion We describe the prevalence and demographics of prostate cancer in Colombia using the national healthcare system database. We observed that the prevalence has been increasing over time, and the distribution is variable according to regions, which may be related to racial or environmental causes, or access to the urologist.

In Colombia, the Ministry of Health introduced SISPRO, a tool to collect nationwide information from the health system. The information collected from SISPRO is available for scientific analysis. This article presents an analysis of the prevalence and characteristics of patients with osteoporosis using data from 2012 to 2018. Aim: To estimate prevalence of osteoporosis between January 2012 to December 2018 and describe the patients' demographic characteristics. Methods: This is a descriptive epidemiological study using the International Statistical Classification of Diseases and Related Health Problems related to osteoporosis as search terms using the SISPRO database. Results: National records report 249,803 patients over 50 years old diagnosed with osteoporosis. The estimated prevalence is 2440 cases per 100,000 inhabitants over 50 years old (based on a total population of 10,236,132), being more frequent in women (92% of cases), with a female/male ratio of 12.3:1. Conclusion: This study shows a lower prevalence than previous estimates or projections. Given these findings we think it is necessary to act to promote health policies for patients with osteoporosis.

Kidney involvement is the most frequent manifestation and is often characterized by nephrotic syndrome and kidney failure. This complication usually appears in patients with long-standing disease and is associated with increased morbidity and mortality risk. Diagnosis is by microscopic amyloid observation of tissue biopsy, and when the diagnosis is confirmed, the therapeutic objective is disease activity control. Response assessment is challenging because of a lack of reliable biomarkers. Case Report: A 56-year-old male with a long-standing history of CD treated with a tumor necrosis factor-alpha inhibitor presented with an acute elevation of creatinine in association with clinical and laboratory markers of nephrotic syndrome. Kidney biopsy revealed renal amyloidosis. After treatment adjustment, although a stable creatinine was achieved, the patient had persistent impaired glomerular filtration rate. Conclusion: As a systemic chronic inflammatory disorder, CD may present multisystemic morbidity, for which increased awareness among gastroenterologists is warranted. Renal amyloidosis is an infrequent extraintestinal complication of CD that may lead to chronic kidney impairment.

Moreover, patient suicidal ideation at hospitalization is predictive of reported caregiver suicidal ideation at later time points. Clinicians and rehabilitation specialists may wish to expanding practices of assessing suicide risk in patients to include caregivers, particularly caregivers of patients who endorsed suicidal ideation. Given that these findings demonstrate significant interdependence of suicidality between patients and caregivers, interventions for patients with TBI should include their respective caregivers or even incorporate family systems theories and approaches. Purpose/Objective: Traumatic brain injury (TBI) is associated with depression, anxiety, and even suicidality in individuals with TBI and in caregivers. Moreover, emotional functioning in individuals with TBI is linked with caregiver functioning. However, no known studies to date have examined linkages in suicidal ideation in individuals with TBI and family caregivers. This is especially important in Latin America, where TBI rates are high, and where cultural norms influence family caregiving. This study examined associations among self-reported suicidal ideation in individuals with TBI and their primary caregivers over time in Mexico and Colombia. Research Method/Design: A total of 109 individuals and their primary caregivers completed measures during hospitalization for TBI and at 2- and 4-months posthospitalization. The primary outcome was Item 9 from the Spanish version of the Patient Health Questionnaire-9, assessing for thoughts of death or suicide in the previous 2 weeks. Results: Patients and caregivers reported high levels of suicidal ideation (18.3%-22.4% and 12.4%-15.7%, respectively) at each time point, and suicidal ideation at one time point strongly predicted ideation at the next. When patients endorsed suicidal ideation in the hospital, their caregivers tended to endorse suicidal ideation 2 months later. Although unaccounted for variables could be driving these relationships, they may also provide possible evidence of causal preponderance between patient and caregiver suicidal ideation post-TBI. Conclusions/Implications: Clinicians and rehabilitation specialists can use these findings to inform suicide risk assessment by expanding these practices to caregivers of patients who endorsed suicidal ideation.

Latin American countries have been inclined toward using procyclical fiscal policies. Those policies have been perceived as being effective at mitigating the effects of the 2008-2009 Great Recession. This study aims to estimate the government spending multiplier using Latin American panel data from 19 Latin American countries from 2000 to 2018. The estimates are conditional on the extent of openness, capital mobility and economic freedom. Based on the results, the latter is important: the less economically free a country, the larger its spending multiplier. Lower economic freedom in Latin American countries can help to account for their large spending multipliers. In particular, restrictions on international trade are positively associated with multipliers. This is the case even while controlling the trade share of GDP. Design/methodology/approach The authors provide regression results that are conditional on the extent of openness, capital mobility and economic freedom.

This study aimed to examine the associations between walking and cycling as form active transportation and obesity indicators in Latin American adolescents. Methods: Population-based study with 671 adolescents (mean age: 15.9 [standard deviation: 0.8] years) from eight countries participating in the Latin American Study of Nutrition and Health/Estudio Latino Americano Nutrition y Salud (ELANS). Walking and cycling for active transportation were measured using the International Physical Activity Questionnaire long version. Body mass index, waist circumference, neck circumference, and relative fat mass were used as obesity indicators. Associations were estimated using logistic regression models for the pooled data adjusted for country, sex, age, socio-economic levels, race/ethnicity, leisure-time physical activity and energy intake. Results: Mean time spent walking and cycling was 22.6 (SD: 33.1) and 5.1 (SD: 24.1) min/day, respectively. The median values were 12.8 (IQR: 4.2; 25.7) and 0 (IQR: 0; 6.2) for walking and cycling. Participants reporting ≥ 10 min/week of walking or cycling for active transportation were 84.2% and 15.5%, respectively. Costa Rica (94.3% and 28.6%) showed the highest prevalence for walking and cycling, respectively, while Venezuela (68.3% and 2.4%) showed the lowest prevalence. There was no significant association between walking for active transportation and any obesity indicator. In the overall sample, cycling for ≥ 10 min/week was significantly associated with a lower likelihood of overweight/obesity based on BMI (OR: 0.86; 95%CI: 0.88; 0.94) and waist circumference (OR: 0.90; 95%CI: 0.83; 0.97) adjusted for country, sex, age, socio-economic level, race/ethnicity, leisure-time physical activity and energy intake compared to cycling for < 10 min/week. There were no significant associations between cycling for active transportation and neck circumference as well as relative fat mass. Conclusions: Cycling for active transportation was negatively associated with obesity indicators, especially body mass index and waist circumference.

To mitigate its impact on societies, health systems and economies, countries have adopted non-pharmacological preventive practices such as 'spatial' or 'social' distancing, the use of protective masks, and handwashing; these have been widely implemented. However, measures aimed at protecting physical health and healthcare systems have side-effects that might have a big impact on individuals' wellbeing. As the pandemic reaches low- and middle-income countries, weaker health systems, limited resources and the lower socioeconomic status of their populations make halting the pandemic more challenging. In this article, we explore the impact of COVID-19 and its prevention measures on the wellbeing of vulnerable populations. Special attention must be given to homeless, indigenous, migrant and imprisoned populations, as well as people living with disabilities and the elderly.

A large proportion of patients with COVID-19 requiring hospitalization and/or succumbing to the disease have had diabetes and other chronic conditions as underlying risk factors. In particular, individuals belonging to racial/ethnic minorities in the U.S. and other countries have been significantly and disproportionately impacted. Multiple and complex socioeconomic factors have long played a role in increasing the risk for diabetes and now for COVID-19. Since the pandemic began, the global healthcare community has accumulated invaluable clinical experience on providing diabetes care in the setting of COVID-19. In addition, understanding of the pathophysiological mechanisms that link these two diseases is being developed. The current clinical management of diabetes is a work in progress, requiring a shift in patient-provider interaction beyond the walls of clinics and hospitals: the use of tele-medicine when feasible, innovative patient education programs, strategies to ensure medication and glucose testing availability and affordability, as well as numerous ideas on how to improve meal plans and physical activity. Notably, this worldwide experience offers us the possibility to not only prepare better for future disasters but also transform diabetes care beyond the COVID-19 era. (C) 2020 Elsevier Inc.

The current COVID-19 pandemic is affecting clinical research activities in most parts of the world. The focus on developing a vaccine for SARS-CoV-2 and the treatment of COVID-19 is, in fact, disrupting many upcoming and/or ongoing clinical trials on other diseases around the globe. On March 18, 2020, the United States Food and Drug Administration (FDA) issued an updated guideline for the conduct of clinical trials during the current health emergency situation. The potential challenges, such as social distancing and quarantines, result in study participants' inaccessibility and trial personnel for in-person scheduled study visits and/or follow-up. Due to the sudden onset and wide-spread impact of COVID-19, its influence on the management of clinical trials and research necessitates urgent attention. Therefore, our systematic review ofthe literature aims to assess the impact of the COVID-19 pandemic on the conduction of clinical trials and research. The search for the relevant articles for review included the keywords ""COVID-19"" AND ""clinical trial"" in PubMed, MEDLINE, Embase, Google scholar and Google electronic databases. Key findings include: delaying subject enrollment and operational gaps in most ongoing clinical trials, which in turn has a negative impact on trial programmes and data integrity.

These health behaviors are severely compromised in parts of the world that lack secure water supplies, particularly in low- and middle-income countries (LMICs). We used empirical data gathered in 2017–2018 from 8,297 households in 29 sites across 23 LMICs to address the potential implications of water insecurity for COVID-19 prevention and response. These data demonstrate how household water insecurity presents many pathways for limiting personal and environmental hygiene, impeding physical distancing and exacerbating existing social and health vulnerabilities that can lead to more severe COVID-19 outcomes. In the four weeks prior to survey implementation, 45.9% of households in our sample either were unable to wash their hands or reported borrowing water from others, which may undermine hygiene and physical distancing. Further, 70.9% of households experienced one or more water-related problems that potentially undermine COVID-19 control strategies or disease treatment, including insufficient water for bathing, laundering, or taking medication; drinking unsafe water; going to sleep thirsty; or having little-to-no drinking water.

A critical analysis of the epidemiological data, March to July 2020","Background: Colombia detected its first coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19) case on March 2, 2020. From March 22 to April 25, it implemented a national lockdown that, apparently, allowed the country to keep a low incidence and mortality rate up to mid-May. Forced by the economic losses, the government then opened many commercial activities, which was followed by an increase in cases and deaths. This paper presents a critical analysis of the Colombian surveillance data in order to identify strengths and pitfalls of the control measures. Methods: A descriptive analysis of PCR-confirmed cases between March and July 25 was performed. Data were described according to the level of measurement. Incidence and mortality rates of COVID-19 were estimated by age, sex, and geographical area. Sampling rates for suspected cases were estimated by geographical area, and the potential for case underestimation was assessed using sampling differences. Results: By July 25, Colombia (population 50 372 424) had reported 240 745 cases and 8269 deaths (case fatality rate of 3.4%). A total of 1 370 271 samples had been analyzed (27 405 samples per million people), with a positivity rate of 17%. Sampling rates per million varied by region from 2664 to 158 681 per million, and consequently the incidence and mortality rates also varied. Due to geographical variations in surveillance capacity, Colombia may have overlooked up to 82% of the actual cases. Conclusion: Colombia has a lower case and mortality incidence compared to other South American countries. This may be an effect of the lockdown, but may also be attributed, to some extent, to geographical differences in surveillance capacity. Indigenous populations with little health infrastructure have been hit the hardest. (C) 2020 The Authors.

Data sources We conducted searches in PubMed/MEDLINE, Embase, Cochrane Central Register of Controlled Trials (CENTRAL), grey literature, and in a centralized repository in L·OVE (Living OVerview of Evidence). In response to the COVID-19 emergency, L·OVE was adapted to expand the range of evidence it comprises and has been customized to group all COVID-19 evidence in one place. All the searches covered the period until April 29, 2020 (one day before submission). Study selection and methods We adapted an already published standard protocol for multiple parallel systematic reviews. We searched for randomized trials evaluating the effect, in patients with COVID-19, of vitamin C versus placebo or no treatment. Anticipating the lack of randomized trials directly addressing this question, we also searched for trials evaluating MERS-CoV and SARS-CoV, and non-randomized studies in COVID-19. Two reviewers independently screened each study for eligibility. A living, web-based version of this review will be openly available during the COVID-19 pandemic, and we will resubmit it to the journal whenever there are substantial updates. Results We screened 95 records, but no study was considered eligible. We identified 20 ongoing studies, including 13 randomized trials evaluating vitamin C in COVID-19. Conclusions We did not find any studies that met our inclusion criteria, and hence there is no evidence to support or refute the use of vitamin C in the treatment of patients with COVID-19. A substantial number of ongoing studies should provide valuable evidence to inform researchers and decision-makers soon.

We aimed to examine glycemic control metrics using flash glucose monitoring during insulin treatment and the clinical outcome in hospitalized patients with COVID-19. Methods: Prospective, single-center cohort of adult patients diagnosed with type 2 diabetes or hyperglycemia and COVID-19 infection treated with basal bolus insulin regimen. Glycemic control was assessed with the use of intermittent Freestyle Libre flash glucose monitoring during the hospital stay. Outcome of interest were time in range [TIR], time above [TAR] and below [TBR] range, glycemic variability [coefficient of variation [% CV]), and differences in a composite of complications including ICU admission, acute respiratory distress syndrome (ARDS) and acute kidney injury. Results: A total of 60 patients were included (44 known diabetes and 16 new onset hyperglycemia). In total 190,080 data points of CGM were available, of which 72.5% of values were within the target area [TIR (70-180 mg/dL)], 22% TAR (>180 mg/dL), and 3% were TBR (<70 mg/dL). During treatment, the coefficient of variation (% CV) was 30%. There were no association with TIR, but patients with TAR >180 mg/dl had higher rates of a composite of complications (22.5% vs 16%, p = 0.04). Conclusions: Basal bolus insulin regimen was safe and effective in achieving inpatient glycemic control in most patients with COVID-19. The association between TAR and complications indicates the need for improved inpatient glycemic control in hospitalized patients with COVID-19. (C) 2021 Diabetes India. Published by Elsevier Ltd.

The current systematic review and meta-analysis was conducted to evaluate the safety and immunogenicity of novel COVID-19 vaccine candidates under clinical trial evaluation and present a contemporary update on the development and implementation of a potential vaccines. Methods: For this study PubMed, MEDLINE, and Embase electronic databases were used to search for eligible studies on the interface between novel coronavirus and vaccine design until December 31, 2020. Results: We have included fourteen non-randomized and randomized controlled phase I-III trials. Implementation of a universal vaccination program with proven safety and efficacy through robust clinical evaluation is the long-term goal for preventing COVID-19. The immunization program must be cost-effective for mass production and accessibility. Despite pioneering techniques for the fast-track development of the vaccine in the current global emergency, mass production and availability of an effective COVID-19 vaccine could take some more time. Conclusion: Our findings suggest a revisiting of the reported solicited and unsolicited systemic adverse events for COVID-19 candidate vaccines. Hence, it is alarming to judiciously expose thousands of participants to COVID-19 candidate vaccines at Phase-3 trials that have adverse events and insufficient evidence on safety and effectiveness that necessitates further justification.",Article,"Sathian, B.; Asim, M.; Banerjee, I.; Roy, B.; Pizzaro, A.B.; Mancha, M.A.; van Teijlingen, E.R.; Varkaneh, H.K.; Mekkodathil, A.A.; Subramanya, S.H.; do Nascimento, I.B.; Antony, N.; Menezes, R.G.; Simkhada, P.; Al Hamad, H.",COVID-19; candidate vaccines; Immunogenicity; Solicited and Unsolicited Systemic Adverse Events,COVID-19;candidate vaccines;Immunogenicity;Solicited and Unsolicited Systemic Adverse Events,Qatar;Mauritius;Malaysia;Colombia;United Kingdom;Iran;Nepal;Brazil;India;Saudi Arabia,

Neurogastroenterology is a subspecialty of gastroenterology focused on motility and functional gastrointestinal disorders, including consultations, and conducting procedures (eg, endoscopies, manometries/pH-monitoring). Aim: The aim of this study was to determine the impact of COVID-19 on Neurogastroenterology in Latin America. Methods: Members of the Latin American Society of Neurogastroenterology were invited by e-mail and social networks to participate in an online anonymous survey. It included 24 questions on demographics, clinical practice and procedure characteristics, impact of the pandemic, Telemedicine, and involvement in COVID-19 patient care. Results: Sixty-one members mainly from Colombia, Mexico, and Brazil answered the survey. All reported a negative impact on their practice (88.6%: a 61% to 100% decrease), mainly in office consultations and elective endoscopies. Interestingly, emergency endoscopies decreased by 33.3%, while only 4% stopped performing manometries/pH-monitoring. The main reasons were patients' fear for consulting, country's lockdown, and physician's decision to prevent infection spread. Telemedicine was implemented by 83% but only 64.7% were being remunerated. Almost 46% had to reduce salaries and working hours of their personnel. Fifty-nine percent had colleagues diagnosed with COVID-19, 24.6% were involved in these patients' care, and 11.5% were mobilized to COVID-19 wards. There were country differences: Colombia, lockdown (P=0.001); Mexico, COVID-19 patient-care (P=0.053); Mexico/Colombia, working in COVID-19 wards, (P=0.012); Brazil, less common elective procedures' ban (P=0.012) and Telemedicine/reimbursement (P=0.034). Conclusions: The COVID-19 pandemic has negatively impacted the practice and wellness of Neurogastroenterologists in Latin America.

The aim of this study was to identify factors associated with SARS-CoV-2 infection among HCW in one of the largest cities in Colombia. Methods We conducted a case-control study, where cases had a positive reverse transcription-polymerase chain reaction and controls had a negative result. Participants were randomly selected and interviewed by phone. Analyses were performed using logistic regression models. Results A total of 110 cases and 113 controls were included. Men (AdjOR 4.13 95% CI 1.70-10.05), Nurses (AdjOR 11.24 95% CI 1.05-119.63), not using a high-performance filtering mask (AdjOR 2.27 95% CI 1.02-5.05) and inadequate use of personal protective equipment (AdjOR 4.82 95% CI 1.18-19.65) were identified as risk factors.

The objective was to characterize food security in Colombian families, perception of weight change and lifestyles during social isolation by COVID-19. Methods: cross-sectional study with a descriptive quantitative approach in a non-probabilistic sample, voluntary participant in an electronic access survey. The information was obtained through a structured survey with the Google Forms Drive tool, with three components, sociodemographic, food consumption and level of food safety. The link of the digital survey was socialized in all Colombian regions, during weeks 15, 16 and 17 of the month of April corresponding to the Colombian epidemiological calendar 2020. Univariate and bivariate analysis associated with the axis of food consumption and access was carried out, in the statistical program SPSS v25 and organizing databases in Microsoft Excel. Results: Of the 1,470 surveys applied in 97% of the Colombian territory (31 departments), 76% were completed by women.

,,,4,2-s2.0-85127007820,2022,"Cost-effectiveness of the COVID-19 test, trace and isolate program in Colombia","Background: During the COVID-19 pandemic, Test-Trace-Isolate (TTI) programs have been recommended as a risk mitigation strategy. However, many governments have hesitated to implement them due to their costs. This study aims to estimate the cost-effectiveness of implementing a national TTI program to reduce the number of severe and fatal cases of COVID-19 in Colombia. Methods: We developed a Markov simulation model of COVID-19 infection combined with a Susceptible-Infected-Recovered structure. We estimated the incremental cost-effectiveness of a comprehensive TTI strategy compared to no intervention over a one-year horizon, from both the health system and the societal perspective. Hospitalization and mortality rates were retrieved from Colombian surveillance data. We included program costs of TTI intervention, health services utilization, PCR diagnosis test, productivity loss, and government social program costs. We used the number of deaths and quality-adjusted life years (QALYs) as health outcomes. Sensitivity analyses were performed. Findings: Compared with no intervention, the TTI strategy reduces COVID-19 mortality by 67%. In addition, the program saves an average of $1,045 and $850 per case when observed from the social and the health system perspective, respectively. These savings are equivalent to two times the current health expenditures in Colombia per year. Interpretation: The TTI program is a highly cost-effective public health intervention to reduce the burden of COVID-19 in Colombia. TTI programs depend on their successful and speedy implementation.

Methodology Analytical cohort study of patients with cancer and COVID-19 infection in Colombia. From April 1 to October 31, 2020. Demographic and clinical variables related to cancer and COVID-19 infection were collected. The primary outcome was 30-day mortality from all causes. The association between the outcome and the prognostic variables was analyzed using logistic regression models and survival analysis with Cox regression. Results The study included 742 patients; 72% were >51 years. The most prevalent neoplasms were breast (132, 17.77%), colorectal (92, 12.34%), and prostate (81, 10.9%). Two hundred twenty (29.6%) patients were asymptomatic and 96 (26.3%) died. In the bivariate descriptive analysis, higher mortality occurred in patients who were >70 years, patients with lung cancer, >= 2 comorbidities, former smokers, receiving antibiotics, corticosteroids, and anticoagulants, residents of rural areas, low socioeconomic status, and increased acute-phase reactants. In the logistic regression analysis, higher mortality was associated with Eastern Cooperative Oncology Group performance status (ECOG PS) 3 (odds ratio [OR] 28.67; 95% confidence interval [CI], 8.2-99.6); ECOG PS 4 (OR 20.89; 95% CI, 3.36-129.7); two complications from COVID-19 (OR 5.3; 95% CI, 1.50-18.1); and cancer in progression (OR 2.08; 95% CI, 1.01-4.27). In the Cox regression analysis, the statistically significant hazard ratios (HR) were metastatic disease (HR 1.58; 95% CI, 1.16-2.16), cancer in progression (HR 1.08; 95% CI, 1.24-2.61) cancer in partial response (HR 0.31; 95% CI, 0.11-0.88), use of steroids (HR 1.44; 95% CI, 1.01-2.06), and use of antibiotics (HR 2.11; 95% CI, 1.47-2.95). Conclusion In our study, patients with cancer have higher mortality due to COVID-19 infection if they have active cancer, metastatic or progressive cancer, ECOG PS >2, and low socioeconomic status. Implications for Practice This study's findings raise the need to carefully evaluate patients with metastatic cancer, in progression, and with impaired Eastern Cooperative Oncology Group status to define the relevance of cancer treatment during the pandemic, consider the risk/benefit of the interventions, and establish clear and complete communication with the patients and their families about the risk of complications.

Genetics and epigenetic mechanisms related to the ACE2 gene are associated with changes in its expression and, therefore, linked to increased susceptibility to infection. Although some variables such as sex, age, and obesity have been described as risk factors for COVID-19, the molecular causes involved in the disease susceptibility are still unknown. Aim: To evaluate the ACE2 gene expression profiles and their association with epigenetic mechanisms and demographic or clinical variables. Methods: In 500 adult volunteers, the mRNA expression levels of the ACE2 gene in nasopharyngeal swab samples and its methylation status in peripheral blood samples were quantified by RT-qPCR and qMSP, respectively. The existence of significant differences in the ACE2 gene expression and its determinants were evaluated in different study groups according to several demographic or clinical variables such as sex, age, body mass index (BMI), smoking, SARS-CoV-2 infection, and presence of underlying diseases such as type II diabetes mellitus (DM2), asthma and arterial hypertension (AHT). Results: Our results show that ACE2 gene overexpression, directly involved in susceptibility to SARS-CoV-2 infection, depends on multiple host factors such as male sex, age over 30 years, smoking, the presence of obesity, and DM2. Likewise, it was determined that the ACE2 gene expression is regulated by changes in the DNA methylation patterns in its promoter region. Conclusions: The ACE2 gene expression is highly variable, and this variability is related to habits such as smoking and demographic or clinical variables, which details the impact of environmental and host factors on our epigenome and, therefore, in susceptibility to SARS-CoV-2 infection.",Article,"Daniel, Gonzalez.; Unknown.; Unknown.; Unknown.; Unknown.; Unknown.; Unknown.; Unknown.; Unknown",Angiotensin-converting enzyme 2;COVID-19;Disease susceptibility;Epigenetics;Host factors;SARS-CoV-2,Angiotensin-converting enzyme 2;COVID-19;Disease susceptibility;Epigenetics;Host factors;SARS-CoV-2,Colombia;Colombia,

To estimate the burden of disease of COVID-19 in the department of Nariño, Colombia, based on the disability-adjusted life years (DALYs) between March 2020 and August 2021. Materials and methods. The description and characterization of COVID-19 cases reported between March 2020 and August 2021 was made according to age groups, sex, ethnicity, municipalities of residence and subregions of Nariño by using information from the national surveillance system SIVIGILA. Crude and cumulative mortality rates for COVID-19 were estimated for the previously described variables. Years lost due to premature death (YLL) and years lived with disability (YLD) were calculated. Total DALYs were estimated by adding YLL + YLD. These were calculated by sex, ethnicity, age group and subregions of Nariño. Relative risks were estimated from rate ratios (RR) and 95% confidence intervals for the study variables. Results. The highest morbidity, mortality and DALY rates occurred between February and September 2021, in men, in those older than 70 years, in the Afro-des-cendant ethnic minority group and in the Central, Obando and Juanambú subregions. The burden of disease of COVID-19 in Nariño during the study period is attributed to the YLL, which explain more than 97% of it. Conclusions. This is one of the first studies on burden of disease at the regional level, carried out in Colombia, that employs a standardized methodology for COVID-19. This measurement would generate estimates that would allow targeting resources in an intersectoral manner, mitigating the damage to specific populations and geographic areas, especially the most vulnerable ones.",Article,"Unknown.; Rodriguez, Jorge Martin.; Unknown.; Unknown",Burden Disease;Colombia;Coronavirus;COVID-19;Disability-adjusted Life Year;SARS-CoV-2,Burden Disease;Colombia;Coronavirus;COVID-19;Disability-adjusted Life Year;SARS-CoV-2,Colombia;Colombia,
,,,2,2-s2.0-85095567236,2020,"Covid-19: Adaptation of a model to predict healthcare resource needs in valle del Cauca, Colombia","Background: Valle del Cauca is the region with the fourth-highest number of COVID-19 cases in Colombia (>50,000 on September 7, 2020). Due to the lack of anti-COVID-19 therapies, decision-makers require timely and accurate data to estimate the incidence of disease and the availability of hospital resources to contain the pandemic. Methods: We adapted an existing model to the local context to forecast COVID-19 incidence and hospital resource use assuming different scenarios: (1) the implementation of quarantine from September 1st to October 15th (average daily growth rate of 2%); (2-3) partial restrictions (at 4% and 8% growth rates); and (4) no restrictions, assuming a 10% growth rate. Previous scenarios with predictions from June to August were also presented. We estimated the number of new cases, diagnostic tests required, and the number of available hospital and intensive care unit (ICU) beds (with and without ventilators) for each scenario. Results: We estimated 67,700 cases by October 15th when assuming the implementation of a quarantine, 80,400 and 101,500 cases when assuming partial restrictions at 4% and 8% infection rates, respectively, and 208,500 with no restrictions. According to different scenarios, the estimated demand for reverse transcription-polymerase chain reaction tests ranged from 202,000 to 1,610,600 between September 1st and October 15th. The model predicted depletion of hospital and ICU beds by September 20th if all restrictions were to be lifted and the infection growth rate increased to 10%. Conclusion: Slowly lifting social distancing restrictions and reopening the economy is not expected to result in full resource depletion by October if the daily growth rate is maintained below 8%. Increasing the number of available beds provides a safeguard against slightly higher infection rates. Predictive models can be iteratively used to obtain nuanced predictions to aid decision-making.",Article,"Unknown.; Gomez-Restrepo, Carlos.; Unknown.; Herrera, Socrates.; Unknown.; Khan, Yasin.; Unknown.; Unknown.; Unknown.; Rosselli, Diego.; Unknown.; Villamizar, Pedro Jose.; Unknown.; Unknown.; Unknown",Colombia;COVID-19;Global health;Healthcare resources;Resource constraints;SARS-CoV-2;Valle del Cauca,Colombia;COVID-19;Global health;Healthcare resources;Resource constraints;SARS-CoV-2;Valle del Cauca,Canada;Canada;Canada;Colombia;Brazil;Colombia;Canada;Canada;Canada;Canada;Colombia;Canada;Colombia;Colombia,

Similarly, said Resolution established the Municipal Epidemiological Resilience Index (IREM by its acronym in Spanish) as a tool to support decision-making regarding this economic reactivation amid the third epidemic peak of COVID-19 in the country. The purpose of this article is to perform a critical analysis of the technical aspects of the IREM and to explore the feasibility of its implementation as a support for the resumption of economic and social activities as proposed in the Resolution. The present critical analysis emphasizes on the lack of a clear definition of epidemiological resilience that is consistent with the scientific literature.

To describe the effect of the coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19) pandemic on Latin American rheumatologists from a professional, economic, and occupational point of view. Methods. We conducted an observational cross-sectional study using an online survey sent to rheuma-tologists of each non-English-speaking country member of the Pan American League of Rheumatology Associations (PANLAR). A specific questionnaire was developed. Results. Our survey included 1097 rheumatologists from 19 Latin American countries. Median (IQR) age of respondents was 48 (40-59) years and 618 (56.3%) were female. Duration of practice since graduation as a rheumatologist was 17 years, and 585 (53.3%) were aged < 50 years. Most rheumatologists worked in private practice (81.8%) and almost half worked in institutional outpatient centers (55%) and inpatient care (49.9%). The median number of weekly hours (IQR) of face-to-face practice before the pandemic was 27 (15-40) hours, but was reduced to 10 (5-20) hours during the pandemic. Telehealth was used by 866 (78.9%) respondents during the pandemic. Most common methods of communication were video calls (555; 50.6%), telephone calls (499; 45.5%), and WhatsApp voice calls (423; 38.6%). A reduction in monthly wages was reported by 946 (86.2%) respondents. Consultation fees also were reduced and 88 (8%) rheumatologists stated they had lost their jobs.

A comparative study between Chile and Colombia,"The objective of this research was to study the transformations in the way of working and in the journalistic routines in the main digital media in Chile and Colombia. It investigated how journalistic routines were forcibly modified due to the restrictions imposed by the Covid-19 pandemic and what job challenges inherent to the profession journalists from these media had to face. The six most read news portals in each country were chosen according to the Alexa.com ranking. Twelve semi-structured interviews were conducted with editors and directors of digital press media to make a comparative study. The main results show that journalistic routines were adapted to the contingency. Some changed notably, such as access to sources and the relationship with the interviewees, teleworking and the use of technologies to collect and produce news. Others were strengthened, such as the editorial meeting and the editor's relationship with his work team.

In this work, we have collected information regarding proteins from SARS-CoV-2 and humans and how these proteins interact. We have also collected information from public databases on protein–drug interactions. We represent this data as networks that allow us to gain insights into protein–protein interactions between both organisms. With the collected data, we have obtained statistical metrics of the networks. This data analysis has allowed us to find relevant information on which proteins and drugs are the most relevant from the network pharmacology perspective. This method not only allows us to focus on viral proteins as the main targets for COVID-19 but also reveals that some human proteins could be also important in drug repurposing campaigns. As a result of the analysis of the SARS-CoV-2–human interactome, we have identified some old drugs, such as disulfiram, auranofin, gefitinib, suloctidil, and bromhexine as potential therapies for the treatment of COVID-19 deciphering their potential complex mechanism of action.",Article,"Unknown.; Barbosa, Tabata.; Unknown.; Combariza, German.; Gonzalez, Janneth.; Unknown.; Unknown.; Ramirez, David",COVID-19;drug repurposing;network pharmacology;polypharmacology;protein–drug interaction network;protein–protein interaction network;SARS-CoV-2,COVID-19;drug repurposing;network pharmacology;polypharmacology;protein–drug interaction network;protein–protein interaction network;SARS-CoV-2,Chile;Chile;Colombia;Colombia;Chile;Spain;Chile,

We aimed to describe perceived changes in ease of access to general and mental healthcare among patients with a diagnosis of depression and/or unhealthy alcohol use in Colombia. Methods: This study is embedded in the DIADA project, a multicenter implementation research study aimed at evaluating the integration of mental healthcare in primary care in Colombia. Between November 2020 and August 2021, we conducted a COVID-19 pandemic impact assessment in a cohort of participants with newly diagnosed depression and/or unhealthy alcohol use part of DIADA project. We assessed the ease of access and factors related to perceived ease of access to general or mental healthcare, during the COVID-19 pandemic. Results: 836 participants completed the COVID-19 pandemic impact assessment. About 30% of participants considered their mental health to be worse during the pandemic and 84.3% perceived access to general healthcare to be worse during the pandemic. Most of participants (85.8%) were unable to assess access to mental health services, but a significant proportion considered it to be worse. Experiencing worse ease of access to general healthcare was more frequent among women, patients with diagnosis of depression, and patients with comorbidities. Experiencing worse ease of access to mental healthcare was more frequent among patients aged between 30 and 49.9 years, from socioeconomic status between 4 and 6, affiliated to the contributive social security regime, attending urban study sites, and those who perceived their mental health was worse during the pandemic. Discussion: Despite the overall perception of worse mental health during the pandemic, the use of mental healthcare was low compared to general healthcare. Ease of access was perceived to be worse compared to pre-pandemic. Ease of access and access were affected by geographical study site, socioeconomic status, age and gender.

In the current era of the COVID-19 pandemic, it is worth mentioning that the disease itself and several drugs used for its treatment have been associated with QTc prolongation. Objective: To evaluate the agreement and clinical precision of a portable single-lead electrocardiogram (ECG) device to measure the QTc interval compared to the standard 12-lead ECG. Methods: In sequential tests, QTc of ECG recordings obtained with the KardiaMobile (KM-1L) device (AliveCor, San Francisco, CA) were compared to QTc obtained with conventional 12-lead ECG. Agreement was evaluated using Bland-Altman plots and Lin's concordance coefficient. Consistency between the 2 devices in determining QTc prolongation (QTc ≥470 ms in males or ≥480 ms in females) was evaluated with kappa statistics. Results: A total of 128 patients with a presumed or confirmed diagnosis of COVID-19 admitted to a university hospital were included. QTc intervals measured with KM-1L were similar to QTc measured with conventional ECG (442.45 ± 40.5 vs 441.65 ± 40.3 ms, P = .15). Bland–Altman analysis showed no significant difference in QTc values (average difference of -0.797, 95% limits of agreement:-13.179; 11.585). Lin's concordance coefficient showed an excellent agreement (0.988, P < .001). Concordance between the 2 devices for determining QTc prolongation was excellent (kappa >0.90). Conclusion: ECG recordings obtained with KM-1L allow an accurate QTc interval assessment.

To date, increasing evidence has described the potential negative impact of SARS-CoV-2 infection on pregnant women. Although the pathophysiology of coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19) is not entirely understood, there is emerging evidence that it causes a severe systemic inflammatory response associated with vascular alterations that could be of special interest considering some physiological changes in pregnancy. Additionally, these alterations may affect the physiology of the placenta and are associated with pregnancy complications and abnormal histologic findings.

,,,2,2-s2.0-85106886547,2021,The ignored pandemic of public health corruption: A call for action amid and beyond SARS-CoV-2/COVID-19,"Corruption in healthcare is on the rise. When corruption infiltrates global health, causes embezzlement of public health funds, malfunctioning medical equipment, fraudulent or ineffective health services such as expired medicines and fake vaccines that could have life-or-death consequences. A corrupt healthcare system, amid global health crises like the COVID-19 pandemic, when resources are in constraint and trust is in high demand, can lead to devastating, though avoidable, health and economic consequences. It is imperative for policymakers, health experts, patients, caregivers, and global health funders to promptly acknowledge and address corruption in healthcare. The current pandemic generates an emergency and disorder state on health care systems across the globe, especially in low-and middle-income countries, where a weakening of control measures is evident, creating the perfect storm for corruption. This paper builds on existing research to examine processes that support essential stakeholder engagement in anti-corruption efforts. In this context, an extensive review of literature has been conducted by using various databases such as PubMed, Science direct, SCOPUS, Research Gate, and Google Scholar and a total of 45 articles and documents on corruption and COVID-19 were screened and selected by authors independently. To fill the knowledge gaps about the need for actions to be taken during a pandemic like COVID-19, we propose an anti-corruption grassroots movement that focuses on changing the social norms surrounding corruption in healthcare. By pushing forward a practice that normalizes conversations about corruption in everyday health practices and involving more stakeholders in the protection of public health resources, we argue that not only local health systems can become more resilient and resistant to corruption, but also global health initiatives can become more effective and efficient to improve individual and global health.",Article,"Unknown.; Unknown.; Rosselli, Diego.; Unknown.; Unknown.; Bolanos-Portilla, Ana M.; Unknown.; Rodriguez-Morales, Alfonso J.; Unknown",Coronavirus;Corruption;COVID-19;Economics;Fraud;Global health;Pandemics;Public health systems research;Social responsibility,Coronavirus;Corruption;COVID-19;Economics;Fraud;Global health;Pandemics;Public health systems research;Social responsibility,United States;Colombia;Colombia;Colombia;Colombia;Colombia;India;India;United Kingdom,
,,,2,2-s2.0-85134490077,2022,Understanding the Potential Impact of Different Drug Properties on Severe Acute Respiratory Syndrome Coronavirus 2 (SARS-CoV-2) Transmission and Disease Burden: A Modelling Analysis,"Background. The public health impact of the coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19) pandemic has motivated a rapid search for potential therapeutics, with some key successes. However, the potential impact of different treatments, and consequently research and procurement priorities, have not been clear. Methods. Using a mathematical model of severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2 (SARS-CoV-2) transmission, COVID-19 disease and clinical care, we explore the public-health impact of different potential therapeutics, under a range of scenarios varying healthcare capacity, epidemic trajectories; and drug efficacy in the absence of supportive care. Results. The impact of drugs like dexamethasone (delivered to the most critically-ill in hospital and whose therapeutic benefit is expected to depend on the availability of supportive care such as oxygen and mechanical ventilation) is likely to be limited in settings where healthcare capacity is lowest or where uncontrolled epidemics result in hospitals being overwhelmed. As such, it may avert 22% of deaths in high-income countries but only 8% in low-income countries (assuming R = 1.35). Therapeutics for different patient populations (those not in hospital, early in the course of infection) and types of benefit (reducing disease severity or infectiousness, preventing hospitalization) could have much greater benefits, particularly in resource-poor settings facing large epidemics. Conclusions. Advances in the treatment of COVID-19 to date have been focused on hospitalized-patients and predicated on an assumption of adequate access to supportive care. Therapeutics delivered earlier in the course of infection that reduce the need for healthcare or reduce infectiousness could have significant impact, and research into their efficacy and means of delivery should be a priority.",Article,"Unknown.; Unknown.; Alvarez, Carlos Arturo.; Unknown.; Unknown.; Unknown.; Chanda, Duncan.; Unknown.; Unknown.; Unknown.; Unknown.; Perez, Zulma Milena Cucunuba.; Unknown.; Unknown.; Unknown.; Unknown.; Unknown.; Unknown.; Unknown.; Unknown.; Unknown.; Unknown.; Unknown.; Unknown.; Unknown.; Unknown.; Unknown.; Unknown.; Unknown.; Unknown.; Unknown.; Unknown.; Unknown.; Unknown.; Unknown.; Unknown.; Unknown.; Unknown.; Unknown.; Unknown.; Unknown.; Unknown.; Unknown.; Unknown.; Unknown.; Unknown.; Unknown.; Unknown.; Valderrama-Beltran, Sandra Liliana.; Unknown.; Unknown.; Unknown.; Unknown",COVID-19;epidemiology;modelling;SARS-CoV-2;therapeutics,COVID-19;epidemiology;modelling;SARS-CoV-2;therapeutics,Thailand;Thailand;Viet Nam;United Kingdom;Ecuador;Thailand;Colombia;Zambia;Zambia;Indonesia;Indonesia;Kenya;Colombia;Brazil;Colombia;Venezuela;Brazil;United Kingdom;India;United Kingdom;United Kingdom;Thailand;United Kingdom;Brazil;United Kingdom;Brazil;Venezuela;United States;Kenya;Brazil;Venezuela;Thailand;Argentina,

The pandemic was declared in March 2020, which so far has claimed more than two million lives. At the beginning of 2021, vaccination began in the main cities of the world, a strategy that generated great controversies regarding the possibility of applying it as a mandatory application to the population. Objective: To address the most relevant ethical aspects of the notion of obligatory nature of the vaccine against COVID-19, and to provide elements for the bioethical analysis on this measure. Methodology: Wide literature search in the main databases and hermeneutical analysis. Results: Six documents related to ethical aspects regarding compulsory vaccination were found. Analysis of various bioethical perspectives for and against immunization. Conclusion: In favor of the optional notion of vaccination, there are important bioethical reasons to consider respect for the principles of autonomy, non-maleficence, responsibility and agency. Faced with vaccination in a pandemic, information and education should be considered as one of the most important strategies for adherence to this public health measure.",Article,"Galvis, M.D.P.",ethics; ethical; vaccine; COVID-19; SARS; CoV-2,ethics;ethical;vaccine;COVID-19;SARS;CoV-2,Colombia,
,,,1,WOS:000596733900004,2020,"COVID-19: Adaptation of a model to predict healthcare resource needs in Valle del Cauca, Colombia","Background: Valle del Cauca is the region with the fourth-highest number of COVID-19 cases in Colombia (>50,000 on September 7, 2020). Due to the lack of anti-COVID-19 therapies, decision-makers require timely and accurate data to estimate the incidence of disease and the availability of hospital resources to contain the pandemic. Methods: We adapted an existing model to the local context to forecast COVID-19 incidence and hospital resource use assuming different scenarios: (1) the implementation of quarantine from September 1st to October 15th (average daily growth rate of 2%); (2-3) partial restrictions (at 4% and 8% growth rates); and (4) no restrictions, assuming a 10% growth rate. Previous scenarios with predictions from June to August were also presented. We estimated the number of new cases, diagnostic tests required, and the number of available hospital and intensive care unit (ICU) beds (with and without ventilators) for each scenario. Results: We estimated 67,700 cases by October 15th when assuming the implementation of a quarantine, 80,400 and 101,500 cases when assuming partial restrictions at 4% and 8% infection rates, respectively, and 208,500 with no restrictions. According to different scenarios, the estimated demand for reverse transcription-polymerase chain reaction tests ranged from 202,000 to 1,610,600 between September 1st and October 15th. The model predicted depletion of hospital and ICU beds by September 20th if all restrictions were to be lifted and the infection growth rate increased to 10%. Conclusion: Slowly lifting social distancing restrictions and reopening the economy is not expected to result in full resource depletion by October if the daily growth rate is maintained below 8%. Increasing the number of available beds provides a safeguard against slightly higher infection rates. Predictive models can be iteratively used to obtain nuanced predictions to aid decision-making",Article,"Iragorri, N.; Gomez-Restrepo, C.; Barrett, K.; Herrera, S.; Hurtado, I.; Khan, Y.; Mac, S.; Naimark, D.; Pechlivanoglou, P.; Rosselli, D.; Toro, D.; Villamizar, P.; Ximenes, R.; Zapata, H.; Sander, B.",COVID-19; SARS-CoV-2; healthcare resources; resource constraints; Valle del Cauca; Colombia; Global health,COVID-19;SARS-CoV-2;healthcare resources;resource constraints;Valle del Cauca;Colombia;Global health,Canada;Colombia;Brazil,

In this narrative review of literature 44 articles that had information about street-level bureaucracy regarding healthcare workers in the COVID-19 pandemic in specific countries (China, United States, Italy, Brazil, Mexico and Colombia) were selected from various databases and analyzed to explore how the implementation of health public policies during the current COVID-19 pandemic impacted and shaped the work of healthcare workers. Various ideas were extracted and analyzed using the street-level bureaucracy model as a reference point. We concluded that street-level bureaucrats have played a crucial role in this pandemic and that providing them with government support, clear public policies and enough resources is essential for them to correctly manage public health problems. Further research needs to be done regarding the consequences brought upon street-level bureaucrats by the pandemic and the impact that street-level bureaucrats have had in countries like Colombia.",Review,"Mendez, D.M.; Gomez, S.M.; Camargo, Y.C.",street-level bureaucrats; healthcare workers; COVID-19; pandemic; autonomy; discretion; public policies; political will,street-level bureaucrats;healthcare workers;COVID-19;pandemic;autonomy;discretion;public policies;political will,Colombia,

Therefore, this paper analyzes changes in the idiosyncratic risk of Bitcoin in a portfolio of commodities and global stocks. For this purpose, the M-GARCH model employed considers the interdependence among all the portfolio assets by using a time-varying asset pricing framework. This framework measures the impact of commodities and global stock prices as sources of systemic risk for Bitcoin returns before and after the COVID-19 pandemic. The evidence suggests that during the COVID-19 pandemic, the effects of changes in commodities and global prices on the idiosyncratic risk of Bitcoin were statistically significant. The idiosyncratic risk of Bitcoin measured as a percentage of total variance not accounted for by the proposed model rose from 86.06% to 95.05% during the pandemic. These results are in line with previous studies regarding the properties of Bitcoin as a hedge or safe haven asset for a portfolio composed of commodities and global stocks.",Article,"Cayon, Edgardo.; Sarmiento, Julio",Bitcoin;COVID-19;Diversification;Idiosyncratic risk;Safe haven;Systemic risk,Bitcoin;COVID-19;Diversification;Idiosyncratic risk;Safe haven;Systemic risk,Colombia;Colombia,

A cross-sectional observational study was conducted using a digital anonymous survey. Rheumatic patients >= 18 years from non-English-speaking PANLAR countries were included. Our survey included 3502 rheumatic patients living in more than 19 Latin-American countries. Median age of patients was 45.8(36-55) years and the majority (88.9%) was female. Most frequently self-reported disease was rheumatoid arthritis (48.4%). At least one anti-rheumatic treatment was suspended by 23.4% of patients. Fear of contracting SARS-Cov2 (27.7%) and economic issues (25%) were the most common reasons for drug discontinuation. Self-rated disease activity increased from 30 (7-50) to 45 (10-70) points during the pandemic. Communication with their rheumatologist during the pandemic was required by 55.6% of patients, mainly by telephone calls (50.2%) and social network messages (47.8%). An adequate knowledge about COVID-19 was observed in 43% of patients. Patients with rheumatic diseases in Latin America were negatively affected by the COVID-19 pandemic.

Methods: We carried a cross sectional study using a web-based survey to assess mental health and personal impact among 18 to 24 years old living in Bogotá during the first 4 months of the 2020 COVID-19 pandemic lockdown. The depressive symptoms were measured with PHQ-8 and anxiety symptoms with (GAD-7). We also designed a questionnaire exploring changes in personal, family and social life. Results: Overall, 23% of the sample (n = 834) reported mild depressive symptoms (males 24% and females 23%); 29% reported moderate depressive symptoms (males 28%, females 30%); 22% moderate-severe symptoms (males 20%, females 23%) and 17% severe symptoms (males 15%, females 17%). Mild anxiety symptoms were reported by 29% of the sample (males 30%, females 29%); moderate anxiety symptoms by 29% (males 26%, females 30%); moderate-severe 18% (males 15%, females 20%) and severe anxiety by 6.0% (males 6.0% and females 6.0%). High symptoms of depression (PHQ-8 ≥ 10) were associated with being female, considering that the quarantine was stressful, having one member of the family losing their job, worsening of family relationships, decrease of physical activity and having a less nutritious diet. Having high anxiety symptoms (GAD-7 ≥ 10) were associated with sometimes not having enough money to buy food. Conclusions: The first months of the pandemic lockdown were associated with high depressive and anxiety symptoms among young persons living in Bogotá, Colombia.

Objectives- Three mathematical optimization models are proposed, aiming to find the lowest billing cost for the end-user through flexible load characteristics and seeking optimization through mixed-integer linear programming models. Methodology- For the calculation of hourly rates, the mathematical formulation described in resolution CREG 015 is implemented and hourly rates are obtained in three different levels following a logic similar to the demand response schemes called Time of Use. Results- The results obtained show that a demand response program with hourly rates effectively introduces an economic incentive during the evaluated period, through the possibility of modifying consumption patterns that reduce the payment of the electricity bill. Conclusions- The proposed model of energy demand through scheduling selected flexible loads model and the opportunity to use the energy stored in electric vehicles generates economic benefits for the user by minimizing the cost of energy during the teleworking period in COVID-19 pandemic.",Article,"Montana-Salas, S.D.; Correa-Florez, C.A.",Demand Response; optimization; storage systems; Covid-19,Demand Response;optimization;storage systems;Covid-19;MARKETS,Colombia,

Radiation oncology departments and international collaboration groups are sharing their management adaptations made in response to the pandemic. The present narrative review summarizes the current recommendations. Relevance: There is a need to define which patients are candidates for safe treatment delay until the pandemic is over or controlled, to reduce exposure to the virus in the healthcare personnel and patients. Conclusions: Telemedicine is recommended for follow-up visits. Active surveillance is the preferred treatment for patients with favorable intermediate risk. In greater risk disease, hormone therapy safely postpones radiotherapy up to 7 months. Radiosurgery is suggested in centers that have the necessary technology and previous experience. A moderately hypofractionated regimen is recommended if radiosurgery/ultra-hypofractionation is not available. Hypofractionation should be implemented if image-guided radiation therapy is already in place. Countries with low and middle-income economies face challenges in adopting the recommendations for prostate cancer management during the pandemic.

Objective: To evaluate the impact of the use of two types of PPE on quality of vision during gastrointestinal endoscopy. Methods: A cross-sectional observational pilot study in gastroenterologists who undergo an ophthalmological examination of visual acuity and quality of vision when using two types of PPE. Type #1: 3M N95 1860 green respirator + 3M mono safety glasses + protective screen. Type #2: 3M 6800 full facepiece + 3M NIOSH 7093C HF/P100 filters. Results: Visual acuity and quality of vison parameters white using the PPE that is routinely used when performing gastrointestinal endoscopy during the pandemic were evaluated. It was found that Modality #1 was associated with decreases of up to 37% in visual acuity, 25% in colour visualisation and 75% in contrast sensitivity among digestive endoscopists within minutes of placement. These figures worsened over the course of the procedure, rising to 75%, 60% and 100%, respectively. Modality #2 was not associated with any deterioration in quality of vision.

The impact on student satisfaction regarding their medical education is unknown, especially in postgraduate programs. Objective: To assess the satisfaction of residents in relation to theoretical and practical components, as well as their perception of change. Methods: The Department of Internal Medicine of Pontifical Xavierian University and San Ignacio University Hospital, in Bogotá, Colombia, have changed multiple theoretical academic activities into virtual modalities. They modified healthcare activities and used technological platforms that allowed the remote participation of residents or professors. A survey was designed for assessing the satisfaction of residents in relation to the theoretical and practical components, as well as their perception of change. Results: Forty-eight residents answered the survey. More than 72% reported being partially or totally satisfied with organization, with the content of the activities, with the interdisciplinary approach, and with the opportunity to discuss topics for theoretical activities. Regarding assessment of healthcare activities, 21.9% of the residents manifested that they were not satisfied with the training that they received for clinical practice and professional life, while 31.3% manifested their dissatisfaction with the interdisciplinary approach or with the time allotted to discuss cases. 72.9% were satisfied with the technological tools used. The level of perceived stress worsened for 62.5% of the respondents, while the opportunity to develop and practice skills worsened for 64.6% of those surveyed. Conclusions: Despite the high satisfaction with the theoretical activities and the technological tools used, residents consider that the implementation of remote academic activities is associated with higher levels of stress and fewer opportunities to develop and practice clinical skills.",Article,"Munoz, Oscar Mauricio",academic satisfaction;COVID-19;internal medicine;medical education;pandemic;postgraduate education;SARS-CoV-2,academic satisfaction;COVID-19;internal medicine;medical education;pandemic;postgraduate education;SARS-CoV-2,Colombia,

This challenge has been further compounded by the global COVID-19 pandemic and the subsequent lockdown and physical distancing measures implemented, which caused exceptional challenges to human activities. Online focus groups (OFGs) are an example of an alternative strategy and require further study. At present, OFGs have mostly been studied and used in high-income countries, with little information relating to their implementation in low- and middle-income countries (LMICs). Objective: The aim of this study is to share our experiences of conducting OFGs through a web conferencing service and provide recommendations for future research. Methods: As part of a broader study, OFGs were developed with adults and adolescents in Colombia during the COVID-19 pandemic. Through a convenience sampling method, we invited eligible participants via email in two different cities of Colombia to participate in OFGs conducted via Microsoft Teams. Researcher notes and discussion were used to capture participant and facilitator experiences, as well as practical considerations. Results: Technical issues were encountered, but various measures were taken to minimize them, such as using a web conferencing service that was familiar to participants, sending written instructions, and performing a trial meeting prior to the OFG. Adolescent participants, unlike their adult counterparts, were fluent in using web conferencing platforms and did not encounter technical challenges. Conclusions: OFGs have great potential in research settings, especially during the current and any future public health emergencies. It is important to keep in mind that even with the advantages that they offer, technical issues (ie, internet speed and access to technology) are major obstacles in LMICs.

Perspectives from the global pandemic,"In the context of Covid-19 pandemic, this paper reflects on the effects of great epidemics on our cultural attitudes towards illness and death. First, through a parallel between the coronavirus pandemic and the medieval Black Death, I examine the impact of epidemics on our ways of thinking about reality and of responding collectively to the fear of dying. Based on the historical periodization of the different mentalities towards death, formulated by Philippe Ariès, I argue that epidemic phenomena modify the way in which the different cultures conceive and deal with finitude, and how this fact manifests itself in the contemporary society, characterized by the denial of death. I conclude that current pandemic can lead us to a thoughtful reappropriation of our mortality. Second, based on the reflections of American writer Susan Sontag, I analyze the negative impact of military metaphors associated with contagious diseases, and how these metaphors promote our fears and irrational attitudes in the face of crisis. Finally, I show that the emergence of new pathologies, such as coronavirus disease, is generating a conceptual change in medicine that leads to rethinking many of the traditional ideas regarding microorganisms and the infections they cause. I claim that this scientific revolution may contribute to a positive modification in our ways of understanding death and disease, and to the search for a more balanced relationship with the natural environment that also helps prevent future pandemics.",Article,"Bohorquez-Carvajal, Julian",Attitudes towards death;Black death;Covid-19;Death denial;Ecological microbiology;Military metaphors;SARS-CoV-2,Attitudes towards death;Black death;Covid-19;Death denial;Ecological microbiology;Military metaphors;SARS-CoV-2,Colombia,

The Delta variant has a higher replication capacity and is associated with viral loads up to 1 260 times higher than those of infections caused by the original strain, which may be associated with an increased likelihood of hospitalization, ICU admission, need for oxygen therapy, pneumonia, or even death. Fully vaccinated individuals have almost similar protection against both Delta and Alpha variants. Given the impact of Delta in countries where it is the dominant variant, it is necessary for all countries to develop systematic action plans focused on implementing strict public health and social measures in the context of the COVID-19 pandemic and on increasing vaccination coverage. Bearing this in mind, the objective of this reflection paper is to describe the main characteristics of the Delta variant, its impact on the dynamics of the pandemic in some of the countries where it has been detected, the effectiveness of vaccines against this variant, and its implications for public health in Colombia.",Article,"Unknown.; Vega-Romero, Roman.; Restrepo-Henao, Alexandra.; Unknown.; Unknown.; Unknown",COVID-19;Pandemic;Public Health (MeSH);SARS-CoV-2,COVID-19;Pandemic;Public Health (MeSH);SARS-CoV-2,Colombia;Colombia;Colombia;Colombia;Colombia;Colombia,

Statistics on DA in intensive care in Colombia are scarce, as are the intervention data and resources available in the units. The main objective was to determine the prevalence and characteristics of anatomical and physiological difficult airway. Methods: An observational, cross-sectional, multicentre study was conducted in adult Intensive Care Units (ICU) in Quindío. Links to two Google® forms were sent to the Coordinating Intensivists, one general and one specific related to DA anatomical factors (Mallampati, obstructive apnoea, stiff cervical spine, obesity, external appearance, Cormack-Lehane > 2, etc.) and physiological (oxygenation disorder, state of collapse, anaemia, etc.). Results: Four units participated, with 62 beds (83.9% of the beds in the department); 56 hospitalized patients were found, 38 patients (67.8%) were intubated. Of the patients, 29% had some type of difficult airway. Of the patients with difficult airway, 100% had physiological DA parameters and 27.3% anatomical difficult airway: 18.2% Cormack-Lehane (CL) > 2, and 9.1% subglottic stenosis.

Pandemics are not a new phenomenon for humanity. COVID-19 pandemic brings unprecedented concerns that merit a careful reading, especially regarding digital contact tracing. Methods. A digital ethnography was carried out between March to September of 2020 to characterize the mobile applications created in Colombia for COVID-19 digital contact tracing. Emphasis was put on CoronApp, supported by the national government, leading to an analysis of citizens' discussions about these interventions on social networks. Results. Sixteen technologies for COVID-19 were identified, among mobile tracing applications and internet applications for labor, social, and mobility monitoring. The CoronApp application had more than 10 million downloads and it was the most used in the country. Users concerns were frequent, especially apropos the lack of guarantees of confidentiality in the handling of data, invasion of privacy, risk of commercialization, the power of state, the role of digital citizens' rights, as well as the lack of clarity on the epidemiological policy behind the apps.

Seeds from Caesalpinia spinosa, have been traditionally used for the treatment of inflammatory pathologies and respiratory diseases. Our team has obtained an extract called P2Et, rich in polyphenols derived from gallic acid with significant antioxidant activity, and the ability to induce complete autophagy in tumor cells and reduce the systemic inflammatory response in animal models. Methods: In this work, a phase II multicenter randomized double-blind clinical trial on COVID-19 patients was designed to evaluate the impact of the P2Et treatment on the clinical outcome and the immunological parameters related to the evolution of the disease. The Trial was registered with the number No. NCT04410510*. A complementary study in an animal model of lung fibrosis was carried out to evaluate in situ lung changes after P2Et in vivo administration. The ability of P2Et to inhibit the viral load of murine and human coronaviruses in cellular models was also evaluated. Results: Patients treated with P2Et were discharged on average after 7.4 days of admission vs. 9.6 days in the placebo group. Although a decrease in proinflammatory cytokines such as G-CSF, IL-15, IL-12, IL-6, IP10, MCP-1, MCP-2 and IL-18 was observed in both groups, P2Et decreased to a greater extent G-CSF, IL-6 and IL-18 among others, which are related to lower recovery of patients in the long term. The frequency of T lymphocytes (LT) CD3+, LT double negative (CD3+CD4-CD8-), NK cells increased in the P2Et group where the population of eosinophils was also significantly reduced. In the murine bleomycin model, P2Et also reduced lung inflammation and fibrosis. P2Et was able to reduce the viral replication of murine and human coronaviruses in vitro, showing its dual antiviral and anti-inflammatory role, key in disease control. Conclusions: Taken together these results suggest that P2Et could be consider as a good co-adjuvant in the treatment of COVID-19.

This review evaluated their therapeutic potential against Covid-19 and mapped the 10 most studied plants during the pandemic. The standardized protocol for systematic reviews (PRISMA-P) was developed in this study. All studies involving medicinal plants and their potential against Covid-19 infection were also considered. Two specific search fields “traditional medicine and Covid-19” and “medicinal plants and Covid-19” with appearance in the title, abstract and keywords were used to search for information. Only papers (review and original) published between 2020 and October 2021 were included. Short communications, letters to the editor, books and book chapters were excluded. A total of 24,046 articles were recorded among the four databases and an increase of 69% in publications for the 2021 search date, a higher percentage compared to the previous year (31%). China was the country with the highest production with 28% (2725 papers). The analysis of variance showed that the number of studies of Nigella sativa L. (1.62 ± 0.21; p = 0.02), Glycyrrhiza glabra L. (1.50 ± 0.32; p = 0.03), Zingiber officinale Roscoe (1.51 ± 0.32; p = 0.03) were statistically significant with respect to the other species. This is probably because these species show compounds with high antiviral spectrum.

Predictably, the most vulnerable populations have suffered the most devastating consequences in terms of health, unemployment and increased inequality. In some countries the informal economy has become larger than the formal economy. The Social and Solidarity Economy (hereafter SSE) has also suffered the consequences caused by covid-19, but it has also been a response to the multiple situations that have occurred in all countries. The aim of this paper is to examine the role of the SSE at the international level by looking at two issues: one, to examine the responses of the SSE to the crisis caused by the covid-19 pandemic and two, to analyse the role of the SSE in future social and economic recovery. To this end, a comparative analysis is made of the responses, strategies and role of the social economy in different territories, Quebec, Colombia and Spain.",Article,"Alvarez, J.F.; Bouchard, M.J.; Marcuello, C.",Social Economy; International Approach; COVID-19,Social Economy;International Approach;COVID-19,Colombia;Canada;Spain,

Despite the existence of teleconsultation services in Colombia, few studies about it have been published. As a result of the health crisis caused by the COVID-19 pandemic, the Telepsychology care service was implemented in a university psychological care center. The goal of this study is to characterize the care experiences of the Telepsychology modality from the point of view of the consultants and students in their clinical practice. This with the purpose of enhancing the knowledge in this area and contributing to the evaluation of the viability of these services. A descriptive characterization study was carried out, with a cross-sectional design. The research team elaborated a questionnaire, that was answered by 253 consultants and 77 students. The information obtained evidenced that Telepsychology care achieved high levels of satisfaction with the treatment received, the possibility of establishing a therapeutic bond and the development of clinical skills in students. Therefore, this care modality was an alternative to remove boundaries to health care.

The COVID-19 pandemic has led health services to adapt, surgical training has had to restructure, and personal life has had to thrive hardships. We aimed to describe the evolution of surgeons' and residents' per-ceptions about the impact COVID-19 has had on Colombia's surgical practice. Methods. Descriptive cross-sectional study using a structured electronic survey among general surgery residents, and graduated surgeons who have a clinical practice in Colombia. Results. 355 participants were included, with a median age of 37 years (IQR 30, 51), and 32.1% female. There were 28.7% residents, 43.3% general surgeons, and 27.8% subespecialist in surgery. Overall, 48.7% of respondents were from Bogotá, and 38.8% worked at academic private hospitals. Although almost all participants reported having used telemedicine platforms during the pandemic, 58% of the respondents did not view telemedicine as sufficient for follow-up consults. More than 80% of surgeons surveyed reported that their monthly incomes had been reduced. Discussion. The second survey showed a better-perceived adherence to safety protocols at their institutions than at the beginning of the pandemic. However, the toll on economic and academic domains are substantial among the surgical community. As the pandemic's effects are expected to last longer in our region, telemedicine services acceptance and healthcare providers' job stability need to be improved in Colombia.",Article,"Diaz-Castrillon, Carlos E.; Unknown.; Unknown.; Unknown.; Unknown",Colombia;Coronavirus infections;COVID-19;General surgery;Health postgraduate programs;Pandemics;Perception;Surveys and questionnaires,Colombia;Coronavirus infections;COVID-19;General surgery;Health postgraduate programs;Pandemics;Perception;Surveys and questionnaires,Colombia;United States;United States;Colombia,

Methods External validation study of a prediction model based on a retrospective cohort of patients with PE secondary to COVID-19 treated at Hospital Universitario San Ignacio and Hospital universitario La Samaritana, between March 2020 and August 2021. Calibration of the scale was evaluated using the Hosmer-Lemeshow test and a calibration belt diagram. Discrimination ability was evaluated using a ROC curve. Results 272 patients were included (median age 61.5 years, male 58.8%). PE was diagnosed in 45.6% of the patients at the time of admission. Of the remaining 54.4%, 95.9% received thromboprophylaxis until the time of diagnosis.17.6% of the patients died. Regarding calibration, the scale systematically underestimates risk in all classes of PESI. For class I, the ratio of observed/expected events was 4.4 vs 0.8%, class II 4.8 vs 1.8%, class III 15.2 vs 4.2%, class IV 14.3 vs 5.9% and class V 46.7 vs 5.8%. The calibration test rejected the adequate calibration hypothesis (p < 0.001). The discriminatory ability was adequate (AUC = 0.7128, 95% CI 0.63-0.79).

Cross-national BED data are presented here and compared with bulimia nervosa (BN) data in the World Health Organization (WHO) World Mental Health Surveys. Methods: Community surveys with 24,124 respondents (ages 18+) across 14 mostly upper-middle and high-income countries assessed lifetime and 12-month DSM-IV mental disorders with the WHO Composite International Diagnostic Interview. Physical disorders were assessed with a chronic conditions checklist. Results: Country-specific lifetime prevalence estimates are consistently (median; interquartile range) higher for BED (1.4%;.8-1.9%) than BN (.8%; .4-1.0%). Median age of onset is in the late teens to early 20s for both disorders but slightly younger for BN. Persistence is slightly higher for BN (6.5 years; 2.2-15.4) than BED (4.3 years; 1.0-11.7). Lifetime risk of both disorders is elevated for women and recent cohorts. Retrospective reports suggest that comorbid DSM-IV disorders predict subsequent onset of BN somewhat more strongly than BED and that BN predicts subsequent comorbid disorders somewhat more strongly than does BED. Significant comorbidities with physical conditions are due almost entirely to BN and to a somewhat lesser degree BED predicting subsequent onset of these conditions. Role impairments are similar for BN and BED. Fewer than half of lifetime BN or BED cases receive treatment. Conclusions: Binge eating disorder represents a public health problem at least equal to BN.

We investigated the prevalence of and factors associated with 22 FGIDs, in 33 countries on 6 continents. METHODS: Data were collected via the Internet in 24 countries, personal interviews in 7 countries, and both in 2 countries, using the Rome IV diagnostic questionnaire, Rome III irritable bowel syndrome questions, and 80 items to identify variables associated with FGIDs. Data collection methods differed for Internet and household groups, so data analyses were conducted and reported separately. RESULTS: Among the 73,076 adult respondents (49.5% women), diagnostic criteria were met for at least 1 FGID by 40.3% persons who completed the Internet surveys (95% confidence interval [CI], 39.9-40.7) and 20.7% of persons who completed the household surveys (95% CI, 20.2-21.3). FGIDs were more prevalent among women than men, based on responses to the Internet survey (odds ratio, 1.7; 95% CI, 1.6-1.7) and household survey (odds ratio, 1.3; 95% CI, 1.3-1.4). FGIDs were associated with lower quality of life and more frequent doctor visits. Proportions of subjects with irritable bowel syndrome were lower when the Rome IV criteria were used, compared with the Rome III criteria, in the Internet survey (4.1% vs 10.1%) and household survey (1.5% vs 3.5%). CONCLUSIONS: In a large-scale multinational study, we found that more than 40% of persons worldwide have FGIDs, which affect quality of life and health care use.

Cross-national population epidemiologic surveys were analyzed to evaluate generalizability of the subtype in more diverse samples. Methods: Interviews were administered to 25,018 respondents in 16 countries in the World Health Organization World Mental Health Surveys. The Composite International Diagnostic Interview was used to assess 12-month DSM-IV PTSD and other common DSM-IV disorders. Items from a checklist of past-month nonspecific psychological distress were used to assess dissociative symptoms of depersonalization and derealization. Differences between PTSD with and without these dissociative symptoms were examined across a variety of domains, including index trauma characteristics, prior trauma history, childhood adversity, sociodemographic characteristics, psychiatric comorbidity, functional impairment, and treatment seeking. Results: Dissociative symptoms were present in 14.4% of respondents with 12-month DSM-IV/Composite International Diagnostic Interview PTSD and did not differ between high and low/middle income countries. Symptoms of dissociation in PTSD were associated with high counts of re-experiencing symptoms and net of these symptom counts with male sex, childhood onset of PTSD, high exposure to prior (to the onset of PTSD) traumatic events and childhood adversities, prior histories of separation anxiety disorder and specific phobia, severe role impairment, and suicidality.

The World Mental Health (WMH) Surveys allow investigation of the implications of the changing criteria compared to DSM-IV and ICD-10. Methods: WMH Surveys in 13 countries asked respondents to enumerate all their lifetime traumatic events (TEs) and randomly selected one TE per respondent for PTSD assessment. DSM-IV and ICD-10 PTSD were assessed for the 23,936 respondents who reported lifetime TEs in these surveys with the fully structured Composite International Diagnostic Interview (CIDI). DSM-5 and proposed ICD-11 criteria were approximated. Associations of the different criteria sets with indicators of clinical severity (distress-impairment, suicidality, comorbid fear-distress disorders, PTSD symptom duration) were examined to investigate the implications of using the different systems. Results: A total of 5.6% of respondents met criteria for ""broadly defined"" PTSD (i.e., full criteria in at least one diagnostic system), with prevalence ranging from 3.0% with DSM-5 to 4.4% with ICD-10. Only one-third of broadly defined cases met criteria in all four systems and another one third in only one system (narrowly defined cases). Between-system differences in indicators of clinical severity suggest that ICD-10 criteria are least strict and DSM-IV criteria most strict. The more striking result, though, is that significantly elevated indicators of clinical significance were found even for narrowly defined cases for each of the four diagnostic systems. Conclusions: These results argue for a broad definition of PTSD defined by any one of the different systems to capture all clinically significant cases of PTSD in future studies.

The global incidence is increasing, and Latin America is no exception. This article reviews MRSA clonal distribution in Latin America and implications for clinical practice. Design: A PubMed literature search (1966-2008) identified 32 articles that characterized MRSA clones in Latin America. Results: Data from these articles show that since 1990, several epidemic MRSA clones have spread in Latin America. The multidrug-resistant Brazilian clone is widespread, especially in Brazil and Argentina, but more recently clones with susceptibility to a range of antibiotics have been detected in Brazil, whereas in Argentina, as in Chile, Colombia and Paraguay, the multidrug-resistant Cordobes/Chilean clone prevails. In Mexico, the New York/Japan clone is most frequent. Data were not available from every country and, despite the increasing prevalence of community MRSA infections, most were collected from tertiary care centers. Conclusions: A variety of epidemic MRSA clones are circulating in Latin America, some of which harbor genes that encode multidrug resistance or enhanced pathogenicity. Continued collection and reporting of epidemiological data is crucial for effective prevention and treatment. (C) 2009 International Society for Infectious Diseases. Published by Elsevier Ltd.

Ongoing surveillance is essential to support infection control committees and clinicians in the prevention and treatment of infection. However, in Latin America, resources for monitoring the changing epidemiology of MRSA remain limited. In this article, we review the current situation of MRSA in Latin America in order to highlight the need for a more harmonised effort to improve its management. Literature in the PubMed and SciELO databases as well as the website of the Pan American Health Organization were searched for articles and information about the epidemiology of MRSA in Latin America. MRSA is already the leading cause of nosocomial infection in the Latin American region, and the number of reports of community-acquired MRSA infections is also rising. However, the extent of the problem is not fully understood, especially since data tend to come from large hospitals whereas much of the population is served by small community healthcare centres that do not have extensive facilities for performing microbiological surveillance. In conclusion, wider-reaching and co-ordinated programmes to provide regular MRSA surveillance reports are required across the Latin American region.

Methods The burden of musculoskeletal disorders was calculated for the EMR's 22 countries between 1990 and 2013. A systematic analysis was performed on mortality and morbidity data to estimate prevalence, death, years of live lost, years lived with disability and disability-adjusted life years (DALYs). Results For musculoskeletal disorders, the crude DALYs rate per 100 000 increased from 1297.1 (95% uncertainty interval (UI) 924.3-1703.4) in 1990 to 1606.0 (95% UI 1141.2-2130.4) in 2013. During 1990-2013, the total DALYs of musculoskeletal disorders increased by 105.2% in the EMR compared with a 58.0% increase in the rest of the world. The burden of musculoskeletal disorders as a proportion of total DALYs increased from 2.4% (95% UI 1.7-3.0) in 1990 to 4.7% (95% UI 3.6-5.8) in 2013. The range of point prevalence (per 1000) among the EMR countries was 28.2-136.0 for low back pain, 27.3-49.7 for neck pain, 9.7-37.3 for osteoarthritis (OA), 0.6-2.2 for rheumatoid arthritis and 0.1-0.8 for gout.

Methods The International Diabetes Management Practices Study provides real-world evidence of patient profiles and diabetes care practices in developing countries in seven cross-sectional waves (2005-2017). At each wave, each physician collected data from ten consecutive participants with type 2 diabetes during a 2 week period. The primary objective of this analysis was to evaluate trends of glycaemic control over time. Results A total of 66,088 individuals with type 2 diabetes were recruited by 6099 physicians from 49 countries. The proportion of participants with HbA(1c) <53 mmol/mol (<7%) decreased from 36% in wave 1 (2005) to 30.1% in wave 7 (2017) (p < 0.0001). Compared with wave 1, the adjusted ORs of attaining HbA(1c) <= 64 mmol/mol (<= 8%) decreased significantly in waves 2, 5, 6 and 7 (p < 0.05). Over 80% of participants received oral glucose-lowering drugs, with declining use of sulfonylureas. Insulin use increased from 32.8% (wave 1) to 41.2% (wave 7) (p < 0.0001). The corresponding time to insulin initiation (mean +/- SD) changed from 8.4 +/- 6.9 in wave 1 to 8.3 +/- 6.6 years in wave 7, while daily insulin dosage ranged from 0.39 +/- 0.21 U/kg (wave 1) to 0.33 +/- 0.19 U/kg (wave 7) for basal regimen and 0.70 +/- 0.34 U/kg (wave 1) to 0.77 +/- 0.33 (wave 7) U/kg for basal-bolus regimen. An increasing proportion of participants had >= 2 HbA(1c) measurements within 12 months of enrolment (from 61.8% to 92.9%), and the proportion of participants receiving diabetes education (mainly delivered by physicians) also increased from 59.0% to 78.3%.

These can be addressed more effectively in a collaborative setting that fosters open exchange of knowledge. In this work, the Latin American and Caribbean Consortium on Dementia (LAC-CD) proposes an agenda for integration to deliver a Knowledge to Action Framework (KtAF). First, we summarize evidence-based strategies (epidemiology, genetics, biomarkers, clinical trials, nonpharmacological interventions, networking, and translational research) and align them to current global strategies to translate regional knowledge into transformative actions. Then we characterize key sources of complexity (genetic isolates, admixture in populations, environmental factors, and barriers to effective interventions), map them to the above challenges, and provide the basic mosaics of knowledge toward a KtAF.

However, there is a lack of objectively measured information on PA and SB in low- and middle-income countries. The aim of this study was to use objective data to characterise socio-demographic patterns of PA and SB in eight Latin American countries. 2732 participants (aged 15-65 years) from the Latin American Study of Nutrition and Health (ELANS) were included. PA and SB data were collected using accelerometers. Overall and country-specific average levels of time spent in PA and SB were compared by sex, age, socioeconomic and education level. Overall, the mean time spent in SB was 571.6 min/day, ranging from 553.8 min/day in Chile to 596.7 min/day in Peru. Average levels of light, moderate-to-vigorous physical activity (MVPA) and total PA were 311.1 min/day (95% CI: 307.7; 314.5), 34.9 min/day (95% CI: 34.0; 35.9) and 7531.2 MET-min/week (95% CI: 7450.4; 7611.9), respectively. MVPA and total PA were higher in men than women. The prevalence of physical inactivity was 40.6%, ranging from 26.9% (Chile) to 47% (Costa Rica and Venezuela). Women were more physically inactive than men (47.7% versus 33.0%). SB levels were highest among those with higher education; PA graded positively with socioeconomic level. Our findings can inform the planning of health policies and programmes designed to reduce levels of physical inactivity, as well as inform the local and cultural adaptation of these policies and programmes for implementation in Latin America. Highlights Worldwide studies of physical activity (PA) and sedentary behaviours (SB) have historically under-represented Latin American countries due to the lack of surveillance data. Across eight Latin American countries, the ELANS study collected data on PA and SB using an objective method (accelerometers) which we have analysed to quantify and characterise socio-demographic patterns. Over four-in-ten participants were physically inactive (40.6%); with a gender gap (47.7% women; 33.0% men); and striking differences between countries (47% Costa Rica and Venezuela; 26.9% Chile). In all countries, levels of moderate-to-vigorous physical activity (MVPA) were lowest, and levels of SB were highest, among participants in the higher education groups.

Nevertheless, the characteristics and uses in South America are unknown. Objectives: To identify sources, characteristics, and uses of RWE in Argentina, Brazil, Colombia, and Chile, and evaluate the context-specific challenges. The implications for future regulation and responsible management of RWE in the region are also considered. Methods: A systematic literature review, database mapping, and targeted gray literature search were conducted to identify the sources and characteristics of RWE. Findings were validated by key opinion leaders attending workshops in 4 South American countries. Results: A database mapping exercise revealed 407 unique databases. Geographic scope, database type, population, and outcomes captured were reported. Characteristics of national health information systems show efforts to collect interoperable data from service providers, insurers, and government agencies, but that initiatives are hampered by fragmentation, lack of stewardship, and resources. In South America, RWE is mainly used for pharmacovigilance and as pure academic research, but less so for health technology assessment decision making or pricing negotiations and not at all to inform early access schemes.

Their ecology is influenced by environmental factors and the presence of specific vectors that determine the establishment and epidemiology in different world regions. In America, during the 20th century, only three of these diseases were recognized: Rocky Mountain spotted fever, epidemic typhus and endemic typhus. However, since 2000, more than 10 different species that had previously been unknown in this continent have been described, both in arthropods and in clinical cases, fact that classifies them as emerging and re-emerging diseases. Given the clinical manifestations of the diseases caused by rickettsias, being the majority unspecific and, therefore, shared with other infectious diseases, especially viral and bacterial, they have been framed within the differential diagnoses of acute febrile syndrome in urban and tropical areas.

Dietary intake of phytoestrogens has been related to abnormal semen quality and hormone levels. However, its effect on couple fecundity is still unclear. Intake of soy products was assessed in 184 men from couples undergoing infertility treatment with invitro fertilization. Couples were recruited between February 2007 and May 2014 and prospectively followed to document treatment outcomes including fertilization, implantation, clinical pregnancy and live birth. Multivariate generalized linear mixed models with random intercepts, binomial distribution and logit link function were used to examine this relation while accounting for repeated treatment cycles and adjusting for potential confounders. Male partner's intake of soy foods and soy isoflavones was unrelated to fertilization rates, the proportions of poor quality embryos, accelerated or slow embryo cleavage rate, and implantation, clinical pregnancy and live birth. The adjusted live birth rates per initiated cycle (95% CI) for partners of men in increasing categories of soy food intake were 0.36 (0.28-0.45), 0.42 (0.29-0.56), 0.36 (0.24-0.51), and 0.37 (0.24-0.52), respectively.

Methods: We performed an external validation study within a historical cohort, including the patients of the primary prevention clinic from the Hospital Militar Central in Bogotá (Colombia). It comprised 1013 patients who were aged 30 to 74 years, free of cardiovascular disease at baseline (1984 to 1996) and followed over 10 years for cardiovascular disease events (coronary death, myocardial infarction, angina pectoris). We compared the number of predicted and observed 10-year cardiovascular disease events (calibration). Finally, we estimated the ability of the risk functions to separate high risk from low risk subjects (discrimination). Results: In patients with low and intermediate risk, the number of cardiovascular disease events predicted by Framingham risk function overestimated those observed (predicted to observed ratio 1.31), with a low ability to separate high risk from low risk subjects (c-statistic 0.65). The PROCAM risk function adjusted by sex had better ability to separate high risk from low risk subjects (c-statistic 0.74) with good calibration (predicted to observed ratio 1.07). We do not have enough high risk patients to extrapolate our results in that population. Conclusion: The Framingham risk function must be used with caution to estimate the absolute cardiovascular disease risk in Colombian low and intermediate risk population without any cardiovascular disease history because of its overestimation and low discrimination abilities.

A critical analysis of the epidemiological data, March to July 2020","Background: Colombia detected its first coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19) case on March 2, 2020. From March 22 to April 25, it implemented a national lockdown that, apparently, allowed the country to keep a low incidence and mortality rate up to mid-May. Forced by the economic losses, the government then opened many commercial activities, which was followed by an increase in cases and deaths. This paper presents a critical analysis of the Colombian surveillance data in order to identify strengths and pitfalls of the control measures. Methods: A descriptive analysis of PCR-confirmed cases between March and July 25 was performed. Data were described according to the level of measurement. Incidence and mortality rates of COVID-19 were estimated by age, sex, and geographical area. Sampling rates for suspected cases were estimated by geographical area, and the potential for case underestimation was assessed using sampling differences. Results: By July 25, Colombia (population 50 372 424) had reported 240 745 cases and 8269 deaths (case fatality rate of 3.4%). A total of 1 370 271 samples had been analyzed (27 405 samples per million people), with a positivity rate of 17%. Sampling rates per million varied by region from 2664 to 158 681 per million, and consequently the incidence and mortality rates also varied. Due to geographical variations in surveillance capacity, Colombia may have overlooked up to 82% of the actual cases. Conclusion: Colombia has a lower case and mortality incidence compared to other South American countries. This may be an effect of the lockdown, but may also be attributed, to some extent, to geographical differences in surveillance capacity. Indigenous populations with little health infrastructure have been hit the hardest. (C) 2020 The Authors.

The aim of this study was to use self-report data to characterise socio-demographic patterns of PA and ST in eight Latin American countries. Methods: Data were obtained from the Latin American Study of Nutrition and Health (ELANS), a household population-based, multi-national, cross-sectional survey (n = 9218, aged 15-65 years), collected from September 2014 to February 2015. Transport and leisure PA and ST were assessed using the International Physical Activity Questionnaire-long version. Overall and country-specific mean and median levels of time spent in transport and leisure PA and ST were compared by sex, age, socioeconomic and education level. Results: Mean levels of transport and leisure PA were 220.3 min/week (ranging from 177.6 min/week in Venezuela to 275.3 min/week in Costa Rica) and 316.4 min/week (ranging from 272.1 min/week in Peru to 401.4 min/week in Ecuador). Transport and leisure PA were higher (p < 0.005) in men than women with mean differences of 58.0 and 34.0 min/week. The mean and median for transport PA were similar across age groups (15-29 years: mean 215.5 and median 120 min/week; 30-59 years: mean 225.0 and median 120 min/week; >= 60 years: mean 212.0 and median 120 min/week). The median time spent in transport and leisure PA between three strata of socioeconomic and education levels were similar. The prevalence of not meeting PA recommendations were 69.9% (95% CI: 68.9-70.8) for transport and 72.8% (95% CI: 72.0-73.7) for leisure. Men, younger people (15-29 years), individuals with higher socioeconomic and education levels spent significantly (p < 0.001) more time sitting than women, older people (30-59 years and >= 60 years) and those in the middle and low socioeconomic and education groups, respectively.

Methods: This study examined data from 8185 adults (aged 18-65 years) from eight Latin American countries. The Neighbourhood Environment Walkability Survey - Abbreviated (NEWS-A) scale was used to assess perceptions of land use mix-diversity, land use mix-access, street connectivity, walking/cycling facilities, aesthetics, safety from traffic, and safety from crime. Perceived proximity from home to public open spaces (metropolitan parks, playgrounds, public squares) and to shopping centers was also measured. Transport-related and leisure-time PA were assessed using the long form of the International Physical Activity Questionnaire. Both logistic and linear regression models were estimated on pooled data. Results: Perceptions of higher land use mix-access (OR: 1.40; 95% CI: 1.22,1.61), the existence of many alternative routes in the neighbourhood (1.12; 1.04,1.20), slow speed of traffic (1.19; 1.03,1.35) and few drivers exceeding the speed limits (1.09; 1.03,1.15) were associated with greater odds of reporting at least 10 min/week of transport-related PA. Perceptions of higher levels of land use mix-diversity, better aesthetics and greater safety from crime, the presence of crosswalks and pedestrian signals, and greater proximity of shopping centers were associated with more min/week of transport-related PA. Perceptions of higher land use mix-diversity (1.12; 1.05,1.20), higher land use mix-access (1.27; 1.13,1.43), more walking/cycling facilities (1.18; 1.09,1.28), and better aesthetics (1.10; 1.02,1.18) were associated with greater odds of engaging in at least 10 min/week of leisure-time PA versus none. Perceptions of higher land use mix-diversity were associated with more min/week of leisure PA.

Methods We conducted an observational study, using data from 24 population- and hospital-based surveillance registries in 18 countries contributing as members of the International Clearinghouse for Birth Defects Surveillance and Research (ICBDSR). Cases of spina bifida that resulted in livebirths or stillbirths from 20 weeks' gestation or elective termination of pregnancy for fetal anomaly (ETOPFA) were included. Among liveborn spina bifida cases, we calculated mortality at different ages as number of deaths among liveborn cases divided by total number of liveborn cases with spina bifida. As a secondary outcome measure, we estimated the prevalence of spina bifida per 10 000 total births. The 95% confidence interval for the prevalence estimate was estimated using the Poisson approximation of binomial distribution. Results Between years 2001 and 2012, the overall first-week mortality proportion was 6.9% (95% CI 6.3, 7.7) and was lower in programmes operating in countries with policies that allowed ETOPFA compared with their counterparts (5.9% vs. 8.4%). The majority of first-week mortality occurred on the first day of life. In programmes where information on long-term mortality was available through linkage to administrative databases, survival at 5 years of age was 90%-96% in Europe, and 86%-96% in North America. Conclusions Our multi-country study showed a high proportion of stillbirth and infant and child deaths among those with spina bifida. Effective folic acid interventions could prevent many cases of spina bifida, thereby preventing associated childhood morbidity and mortality.",Article,"Bakker, M.K.; Kancherla, V.; Canfield, M.A.; Bermejo-Sanchez, E.; Cragan, J.D.; Dastgiri, S.; De Walle, H.E.K.; Feldkamp, M.L.; Groisman, B.; Gatt, M.; Hurtado-Villa, P.; Kallen, K.; Landau, D.; Lelong, N.; Lopez-Camelo, J.S.; Martinez, L.; Morgan, M.; Mutchinick, O.M.; Nembhard, W.N.; Pierini, A.; Sipek, A.; Rissmann, A.; Szabova, E.; Tagliabue, G.; Wertelecki, W.; Zarante, I.; Mastroiacovo, P.",epidemiology; mortality; registry-based study; spina bifida,epidemiology;mortality;registry-based study;spina bifida;NEURAL-TUBE DEFECTS;NEW-YORK-STATE;BIRTH-DEFECTS;SURVIVAL;POPULATION;PREVENTION;INFANTS;PREVALENCE;COHORT,Netherlands;United States;Spain;Iran;Argentina;Malta;Colombia;Sweden;Israel;France;Mexico;United Kingdom;Italy;Germany;Czech Republic;Slovakia;Ukraine,2-s2.0-85074233326

The aim of this study was to test the hypothesis that pain, which is localized to the low back, differs epidemiologically from that which occurs simultaneously or close in time to pain at other anatomical sites Summary of Background Data. Low back pain (LBP) often occurs in combination with other regional pain, with which it shares similar psychological and psychosocial risk factors. However, few previous epidemiological studies of LBP have distinguished pain that is confined to the low back from that which occurs as part of a wider distribution of pain. Methods. We analyzed data from CUPID, a cohort study that used baseline and follow-up questionnaires to collect information about musculoskeletal pain, associated disability, and potential risk factors, in 47 occupational groups (office workers, nurses, and others) from 18 countries. Results. Among 12,197 subjects at baseline, 609 (4.9%) reported localized LBP in the past month, and 3820 (31.3%) nonlocalized LBP. Nonlocalized LBP was more frequently associated with sciatica in the past month (48.1% vs. 30.0% of cases), occurred on more days in the past month and past year, was more often disabling for everyday activities (64.1% vs. 47.3% of cases), and had more frequently led to medical consultation and sickness absence from work. It was also more often persistent when participants were followed up after a mean of 14 months (65.6% vs. 54.1% of cases). In adjusted Poisson regression analyses, nonlocalized LBP was differentially associated with risk factors, particularly female sex, older age, and somatizing tendency. There were also marked differences in the relative prevalence of localized and nonlocalized LBP by occupational group. Conclusion. Future epidemiological studies should distinguish where possible between pain that is limited to the low back and LBP that occurs in association with pain at other anatomical locations.",Article,"Coggon, D.; Ntani, G.; Walker-Bone, K.; Palmer, K.T.; Felli, V.E.; Harari, R.; Barrero, L.H.; Felknor, S.A.; Gimeno, D.; Cattrell, A.; Vargas-Prada, S.; Bonzini, M.; Solidaki, E.; Merisalu, E.; Habib, R.R.; Sadeghian, F.; Kadir, M.M.; Warnakulasuriya, S.S.P.; Matsudaira, K.; Nyantumbu, B.; Sim, M.R.; Harcombe, H.; Cox, K.; Sarquis, L.M.M.; Marziale, M.H.; Harari, F.; Freire, R.; Harari, N.; Monroy, M.V.; Quintana, L.A.; Rojas, M.; Harris, E.C.; Serra, C.; Martinez, J.M.; Delclos, G.; Benavides, F.G.; Carugno, M.; Ferrario, M.M.; Pesatori, A.C.; Chatzi, L.; Bitsios, P.; Kogevinas, M.; Oha, K.; Freimann, T.; Sadeghian, A.; Peiris-John, R.J.; Sathiakumar, N.; Wickremasinghe, A.R.; Yoshimura, N.; Kelsall, H.L.; Hoe, V.C.W.; Urquhart, D.M.; Derrett, S.; McBride, D.; Herbison, P.; Gray, A.; Vega, E.J.S.",diagnostic classification; disability; epidemiology; low back pain; medical consultation; occupation; prognosis; risk factors; sciatica; sickness absence; somatizing,diagnostic classification;disability;epidemiology;low back pain;medical consultation;occupation;prognosis;risk factors;sciatica;sickness absence;somatizing;CHRONIC WIDESPREAD PAIN;MUSCULOSKELETAL PAIN;RISK-FACTORS;COHORT;HEALTH;TRANSITION;NECK,United Kingdom;Brazil;Ecuador;Colombia;United States;Spain;Italy;Greece;Estonia;Lebanon;Iran;Pakistan;Sri Lanka;Japan;South Africa;Australia;New Zealand;Costa Rica;Germany;Malaysia,2-s2.0-85019175875

METHODS: A random sample stratified by decade of age in the database of preoperative electrocardiograms of patients hospitalized for any cause and of those who consult to the emergency department of a high complexity hospital of Bogota. Each electrocardiogram was reviewed to confirm or discard atrial fibrillation. RESULTS: Of a total of 31,716 records, a sample of 2,308 electrocardiograms was selected of which 110 (4.8%) showed atrial fibrillation. The distribution by age group was as follows: 60-69 years 1.8% (16 of 848), 70-79 years 4.6% (38 of 821), 80-89 years 8.9% (43 of 521), and over 90 years 11.0% (13 of 118). The adjusted prevalence for the Colombian population over60 years is 3.6% (95% CI: 3.4-3.8).

It is a cross-sectional, cluster sampling study, which recruited 4454 participants aged >= 20 years. The data were collected in community health-care centers by trained health professionals and medical students. The data collected from each subject included, after informed consent, structured questionnaires (clinical, demographic, physical activity, nutritional and psychological), anthropometric measurements (weight, height and waist circumference), body fat by bioelectrical impedance, hand grip, blood pressure, electrocardiogram, and biochemical measurements (standard 75 g oral glucose tolerance test, total cholesterol, HDL-cholesterol, LDL-cholesterol and triglycerides). The data will be used to estimate the prevalence of overweight, obesity, prediabetes, diabetes, hypertension, dyslipidemias, sarcopenia and metabolic syndrome; and to examine their relationships with lifestyle factors. The risk of coronary heart disease and impaired glucose regulation will be estimated using the Framingham Coronary Heart Disease Risk Score and the Latin America adaptation of the Finnish Diabetes Risk Score (LA-FINDRISC), respectively.

The purpose of this paper is to describe the methods and procedures used for the assessment of physical activity and sedentary time in the Latin American Study of Nutrition and Health (Estudio Latinoamericano de NutriciOn y Salud; ELANS). ELANS is a multicentre, cross-sectional and surveillance study of a nationally representative sample from eight Latin American countries: Argentina, Brazil, Chile, Colombia, Costa Rica, Ecuador, Peru, and Venezuela. Two instruments were used to evaluate different domains and intensities of physical activity and sedentary time: self-reported data and a triaxial accelerometer (model GT3X+). ELANS will generate important self-reported and objective information for the Latin American populations, namely: evidence on the distribution of physical activity and sedentary time across population subgroups (e.g. sex, age, socioeconomic- and educational level). These sets of information will increase the evidence base and can help to inform future intervention strategies in Latin America; self-reported and objective information on physical activity and sedentary time.

Our aim was to determine the prevalence of the microorganisms in the main infections treated in Intensive Care Units (ICUs) in our country. Methods: This is a sub-study of a prospective cohort with 10 general hospitals in Colombia during a 6-month period. The inclusion criteria were hospitalization in ICU and confirmation of infection according to the CDC definitions. Patients were classified into three groups, that is, community, hospital and intensive care, according to the site where the infection was acquired. Results: A total of 826 patients were included in this analysis. Of these, 51% developed infections in the community, 5.33% in the hospital and 43.7% in intensive care unit. Overall, the most common diagnoses were pneumonia (29.54%), intra-abdominal infection (18.16%) and urinary tract infection (11.62%). The most frequent germ in community-acquired infections was E. coli-lung (16.4%), peritoneum (57.7%), urine (55.5%), blood (22.4%)-. E. coli-peritoneum (29.3%), urine (52.9%)- also predominated in the ICU-acquired infections, except for lung and blood in which Staphylococcus aureus (32.4%) and Klebsiella pneumoniae (15.7%) were the most prevalent. Cultures were requested from 655 patients, 40% of them having received antibiotics before cultures were taken, although this did not affected the percentages of positive cultures (P = 0.583). Conclusions: Pneumonia was the main cause of infection regardless of the site of acquisition. E. coli was the most prevalent germ, except in the pulmonary infections acquired in UCI in which S. aureus was the most prevalent. (C) 2010 Elsevier Espana, S.L. and SEMICYUC.

Herein we present systematic data as part of an international multicenter initiative evaluating congenital malformations in South America over a 24-year period. Materials and Methods: A nested case-control study was conducted using the Latin American Collaborative Study of Congenital Malformations (ECLAMC), between January 1989 and December 2012. Cases were stratified as isolated (IH) and non-isolated hypospadias (NIH). Global prevalence was calculated and discriminated by country. Associations between birth weight and gestational age, and NIH distribution by associated abnormality and severity of hypospadias, were analyzed. Results: A total of 159 hospitals from six countries participated, reporting surveillance on 4.020.384 newborns. A total of 4.537 hypospadias cases were detected, with a global prevalence of 11.3/10.000 newborns. Trend analyses showed in Chile, Brazil and Uruguay a statistically significant increase in prevalence. Analysis of severity and associated anomalies did not to find an association for distal cases, but did for proximal (RR= 1.64 [95% CI=1.33-2.03]). Conclusion: This is one of only a few Latin American multicenter studies reporting on the epidemiology of hypospadias in South America in the last two decades.

Its prevalence varies according to the region of the world it is evaluated in. We analyzed a range of maternal, neonatal, and familial variables in a case group and a control group, and compared them with the existing literature.Methods: We collected information from the Latin-American Collaborative Study on Congenital Malformations (ECLAMC) gathered between 2001 and 2006, where we found 27 cases of isolated microtia; we also collected information from 103 control subjects. Data were analyzed using Student's. t and odds ratio (OR).Results: Microtia distribution was 3 (11.1 %) patients with grade I microtia, 19 (70.4 %) with grade II microtia, 2 (7.4 %) with grade III microtia. We found no patients with anotia. Regarding laterality, the right side was involved more often. Male-to-female ratio was 1.7:1. Birthweight ≤ 2,500. g produces an OR of 3.25 (95 % CI, 1.11-9.58) for the development of microtia.Conclusions: Microtia may be directly or indirectly associated with the early onset of labour. Future studies should include long-term follow up of the patients in order to detect possible anomalies of the oculo-auriculo-vertebral spectrum. It is also important to take anthropometric measurements to increase the likelihood of detecting cases of grade I microtia and mid-face hypoplasia, and to define with greater accuracy whether isolated microtia is the mildest form of the oculo-auriculo-vertebral syndrome. © 2009 Elsevier España.

As part of the Latin American Study of Nutrition and Health (ELANS), data were collected from 2524 participants (18-65 years) across eight countries. Participants reported time spent sedentary in different activities (computer use at home, videogame use, reading, sitting down to chat with friends/relatives or listening to music, speaking on the phone, watching TV, and riding in a car). Overall sitting time was assessed using a single item from the International Physical Activity Questionnaire (IPAQ). Device-based sedentary time was assessed using Actigraph GT3X accelerometers. Self-reported overall sitting time (227.1 min/day) produced the lowest values of the three assessment methods, followed by self-reported sum of different types of sedentary behavior (364.1 min/day) and device-based sedentary time (568.6 min/day). Overall, correlation coefficients and ICC varied from weak to moderate (rho: 0.25-0.39; ICC: 0.21:0.39) between self-reported sum of different types of sedentary behavior, self-reported overall sitting time, and device-based sedentary time. The Bland-Altman plots indicated low to moderate agreement between self-reported overall sitting time and device-based sedentary time by sex. Self-report measures underestimate sedentary behavior and overall sitting time when compared with device-based measures. The weak and moderate level of agreement between methods indicates that caution is required when comparing associations between different self-report and device-based measures of sedentary behavior with health outcomes.",Article,"Ferrari, G.; Werneck, A.O.; Silva, D.R.; Kovalskys, I.; Gomez, G.; Rigotti, A.; Cortes, L.Y.; Garcia, M.Y.; Liria, M.; Herrera-Cuenca, M.; Zimberg, I.Z.; Guajardo, V.; Pratt, M.; Cristi-Montero, C.; Marques, A.; Peralta, M.; Bolados, C.C.; Leme, A.C.B.; Rollo, S.; Fisberg, M.",Accelerometry; Epidemiology; Questionnaire; Sedentary lifestyle,Accelerometry;Epidemiology;Questionnaire;Sedentary lifestyle;PHYSICAL-ACTIVITY QUESTIONNAIRE;UNITED-STATES;SITTING TIME;BEHAVIOR;ASSOCIATION;RELIABILITY;MORTALITY;DISEASE;DOMAIN;ADULTS,Chile;Brazil;Argentina;Costa Rica;Colombia;Ecuador;Peru;Venezuela;United States;Portugal;Canada,2-s2.0-85099991877

Global prevalence is 2 in 1000 and in Colombia, 1 in 700. Our goal was to describe cleft palate (CP) prevalence and cleft lip with or without cleft palate (CL +/- P) from 2001 to 2015 in Bogota and Cali, Colombia. Method: Using the ECLAMC case-control design method, information was obtained from the Congenital Anomalies Monitoring and Surveillance Programs in Bogota and Cali. We describe the prevalence of cases classified into the following groups: isolated, polymalformed, and syndromic. The proportion of cases and controls was 1:4. Data were analyzed using frequency distribution and Student t test to compare means and 95% confidence intervals (CIs). Results: We identified 529 OFC cases and 2116 controls from 448,930 births: a rate of 11.8 per 10,000 (CI = 10.80-12.83). From the total cases, 73% were identified with CL/CP compared to 27% with CP. Males had higher CL +/- P (59%) prevalence, whereas the highest neonatal mortality was observed among polymalformed cases (7%). The most common anomaly identified among our cases was cleft lip without isolated cleft palate (58%). We found that OFCs are linked to birthweight, size, and gestational age and higher parity with statistically significant differences in all variables compared to controls. Conclusions: OFC is a highly prevalent anomaly in Colombia, with a range of maternal and infant differences across case subgroups.

Methods This cross-sectional study was carried out from February to November 2007. Multistage conglomerate sampling of 55 rural areas in 13 municipalities led to 516 people being surveyed. The questionnaires used were recommended by PAHO (anthropometric and biochemical measurements). The resulting data was subjected to univariate and bivariate descriptive analysis using 95 % CI, significance tests and comparison with previous studies. Results There was 21.1 % (19.2-23.3 95 %CI) current smoker prevalence, 31.2 % sedentarism (27.8-32.6 95 % CI), 86.3 % people consumed less than 5 portions of fruit and vegetables per day (84.4-87.9 95 % CI), 2.2 % had high alcohol consumption level (1.6-3.2 95 %CI), 26.2 % suffered from hypertension (23.9-28.6 95 % CI), 4.6 % diabetes (3.6-5.8 95 % CI), 62.1 % hyperlipidaemia (59.5-64.7 95 % CI) and 42.9 % (40.4-45.5 95 % CI) were overweight or obese. 85 % had at least 2 or more risk factors simultaneously.

In 2001, the March of Dimes launched a series of biennial assemblies called the International Conference on Birth Defects and Disabilities in the Developing World (ICBD). The latest ICBD, in 2017, convened in Bogota, Colombia, and was attended by over 300 professionals, policymakers, and donors. The conference attendees, a majority of whom were from LAC, supported a call to action in the form of a consensus statement. The consensus statement lists key actions for maximizing birth defects surveillance, prevention, and care in LAC: 1) improving surveillance; 2) reducing risks for birth defects; 3) fortifying staple foods; 4) preventing and treating infections associated with birth defects; 5) implementing newborn screening; 6) providing care and services for people with birth defects and disabilities; 7) involving governments, civil society, and international agencies; and 8) advancing research for birth defects.

Contemporary data on the cancer burden aims to inform effective cancer policies; this article provides an update and benchmarking of national cancer incidence and mortality estimates for the year 2020, alongside recent mortality trends in the region. Methods: The number of new cancer cases and deaths were extracted from the GLOBOCAN 2020 database developed by the International Agency for Research on Cancer (IARC), and mortality data over time from IARC's cancer mortality database, New cancer cases, deaths and corresponding age-standardized rates per 100,000 person-years are presented. Random fluctuations in mortality trends by country, sex and cancer site were smoothed using LOWESS regression. Findings: An estimated total of 1.5 million new cancer cases and 700,000 deaths occur annually in LAC, with corresponding incidence and mortality rates of 186.5 and 86.6 per 100,000. The most common cancers in 2020 were prostate (15%), breast (14%), colorectal (9%), lung (7%) and stomach (5%). Lung cancer remained the leading cause of cancer death (12%), though rates varied substantially between countries. The mortality trends of infectious-related cancers tended to decline in most countries, while rates of cancer types linked to westernization were mainly increasing. Assuming rates remain unchanged, the cancer burden in LAC will increase by 67% reaching 2.4 million new cases annually by 2040. Interpretation: The cancer patterns reflect important underlying sociodemographic changes occurring over the last decades. With an increasing burden anticipated over the next decades in this region, there is a need to plan oncological service provision accordingly.

Significant advances have been achieved in the diagnosis, management, and treatment of LSDs patients. In terms of approved therapies, these include enzyme replacement therapy (ERT), substrate reduction therapy, hematopoietic stem cell transplantation, and pharmacological chaperone therapy. In this review, we summarize the Colombian experience in LSDs thorough the evidence published. We identified 113 articles published between 1995 and 2019 that included Colombian researchers or physicians, and which were mainly focused in Mucopolysaccharidoses, Pompe disease, Gaucher disease, Fabry disease, and Tay-Sachs and Sandhoff diseases. Most of these articles focused on basic research, clinical cases, and mutation reports. Noteworthy, implementation of the enzyme assay in dried blood samples, led to a 5-fold increase in the identification of LSD patients, suggesting that these disorders still remain undiagnosed in the country.

Methods Exposures (based on the weighted daily root mean square acceleration, A(8); the daily vibration dose value, VDV(8); and the daily equivalent static compression dose, S-ed(8)) of 2302 workers during 4 years were estimated using each worker's monthly vehicle operation records and WBV measurements from 11 different types of heavy equipment vehicles in a large coal mine. Company payroll data provided work absence during the concurrent 4 years of exposure. Cox regression models estimated the associations between the different WBV metrics and time to first work absence related to back pain. An adjusted R-2 statistic provided a measure of model fit. Results All estimated metrics of WBV exposures were positively and significantly associated with back pain-related absence. HRs varied from 2.03 to 12.39 for every 0.21 m/s(2) increase in the A(8)-based exposures; from 1.03 to 1.18 for every 1.72 m/s(1.75) increase in VDV(8)-based exposures; and from 1.04 to 1.07 for every 0.06 MPa increase in S-ed(8)-based exposures. Models using the estimated VDV(8) metric for the z axis fit the data best as measured by the R-2 statistic.

The motivation of this study is to analyse the concordance between the ACC/AHA 2013 equation, SCORE and adjusted Framingham, as well as the impact of using one or another in the amount of patients classified as high risk and the amount of patients requiring pharmacological management. Methods 800 patients between 40 and 74 years old were assessed, from the primary prevention clinic of the Hospital Militar Central in Bogotá (Colombia), who were free of cardiovascular events. 10-year risk for atherosclerotic vascular disease was estimated according to the equations proposed by ACC/AHA 2013 guides, the risk of cardiovascular death according to the SCORE function of the European guide and the coronary risk according to the adjusted Framingham function recommended by the Colombian guide. The indication of pharmacological management was considered with an ACC/AHA or adjusted Framingham risk of > 7.5%. A >20% Framingham or a >5% SCORE risk were considered high risk. Results According to Framingham there was a 5.9% of high-risk patients, according to SCORE equations for low-risk countries an 18.7% and according to SCORE equations for high-risk countries, a 31.2%. The Kappa coefficient showed a low concordance between adjusted Framingham and each of the SCORE equations (0.28 and 0.22 respectively). According to the ACC/AHA guide recommendations, hypolipidemic treatment would be indicated in 40.8% of patients, versus a 50.6% following the Colombian guide indications (adjusted Framingham). Kappa coefficient was 0.5735.

Methods As part of the CUPID (Cultural and Psychosocial Influences on Disability) study, potential risk factors for sickness absence from musculoskeletal pain were determined for 11 922 participants from 45 occupational groups in 18 countries. After approximately 14 months, 9119 (78%) provided follow-up information about sickness in the past month because of musculoskeletal pain, including 8610 who were still in the same job. Associations with absence for pain at specific anatomical sites were assessed by logistic regression and summarised by ORs with 95% CIs. Results 861 participants (10%) reported absence from work because of musculoskeletal pain during the month before follow-up. After allowance for potential confounders, risk of absence ascribed entirely to low back pain (n=235) increased with the number of anatomical sites other than low back that had been reported as painful in the year before baseline (ORs 1.6 to 1.7 for >= 4 vs 0 painful sites). Similarly, associations with wider propensity to pain were observed for absence attributed entirely to pain in the neck (ORs up to 2.0) and shoulders (ORs up to 3.4). Conclusions Sickness absence for pain at specific anatomical sites is importantly associated with wider propensity to pain, the determinants of which extend beyond established risk factors such as somatising tendency and low mood.

The aim of this study is to describe the mortality among older adults in the first wave of COVID-19 in Colombia and Mexico. Methods. This is an observational, prospective study on data obtained from open data sets that are publicly available on the websites of the health ministries of the respective countries. COVID-19 cases, age, sex, date to mortality, and mortality itself were analyzed with Kaplan-Meier curves and Cox regressions. Results. Data on 1 779 877 individuals were analyzed, 58.2% from Mexico, with a higher frequency of men for both countries, and 11.7% were older adults. Survival curves show a continuous increase in mortality for Mexico, with higher rates for older adults, while for Colombia the mortality was observed up to 50 days of the follow-up. Finally, hazard ratios were higher for older adults in both countries. Colombia implemented a rigid curfew for older adults, and the effect on mortality is clear from the survival curves.

They include granulomatosis with polyangiitis, microscopic polyangiitis and eosinophilic granulomatosis with polyangiitis. In Latin America, there are few descriptive registries of these patients. The objective of the study was to describe the demographic and clinical characteristics and in-hospital morbidity and mortality of patients with vasculitis associated with anti-neutrophil cytoplasmic antibodies in a university hospital in Colombia. This was a cross-sectional descriptive study. We performed computer searches with terms related to patients with anti-neutrophil cytoplasmic antibody-associated vasculitis, between 2005 and 2017 who met the American College of Rheumatology classification criteria for vasculitis associated with anti-neutrophil cytoplasmic antibodies, and their clinical and laboratory characteristics. One hundred and six patients with anti-neutrophil cytoplasmic antibody-associated vasculitis were included in the study. The average age was 55 years, and 57.5% were women. In 68.8% of the cases, the diagnosis was made during hospitalization, with an average hospital stay of 16.6 days (+/- 12.22). The distribution by type of vasculitis was: granulomatosis with polyangiitis 52%, microscopic polyangiitis 45.2% and eosinophilic granulomatosis with polyangiitis 1.8%. Alveolar hemorrhage occurred in 35% of patients; 20.7% had variable renal involvement, of which 53.8% progressed to advanced kidney disease. Treatment included glucocorticoids 91.5%, cyclophosphamide 62.2%, plasmapheresis 14.1%, and 41.5% required renal replacement therapy. In-hospital mortality was 16.5%, Sepsis was the most common cause of death. We present clinical information on a group of patients with anti-neutrophil cytoplasmic antibody-associated vasculitis; renal involvement was the the most common type of affectation.

HypothesisPhenotypic characterization of EA patients has the potential to identify variables that influence prognosis and subgroups with distinct contributing factors. MethodsA comprehensive cross-sectional phenotypic characterization of 147 EA patients from one of the main referral institutions for CHD in Colombia was carried out. The most prevalent comorbidities and distinct subgroups within the patient cohort were identified through cluster analysis. ResultsThe most prevalent cardiac comorbidities identified were atrial septal defect (61%), Wolff-Parkinson-White syndrome (WPW; 27%), and right ventricular outflow tract obstruction (25%). Cluster analysis showed that patients can be classified into 2 distinct subgroups with defined phenotypes that determine disease severity and survival. Patients in cluster 1 represented a particularly homogeneous subgroup with a milder spectrum of disease, including only patients with WPW and/or supraventricular tachycardia (SVT). Cluster 2 included patients with more diverse cardiovascular comorbidities. ConclusionsThis study represents one of the largest phenotypic characterizations of EA patients reported. The data show that EA is a heterogeneous disease, very frequently associated with cardiovascular and noncardiovascular comorbidities. Patients with WPW and SVT represent a homogeneous subgroup that presents with a less severe spectrum of disease and better survival when adequately managed.

This study aimed to characterize total and whole grain intake in Latin American countries and to investigate foods contributing to these intake in the region. Methods Data were obtained from the multicenter cross-sectional survey Latin American Study of Nutrition and Health (ELANS), including 9128 participants residing in urban areas of eight Latin American countries. Data collection was performed via two household visits using a standardized questionnaire and two 24 h dietary recalls. Usual dietary intake of total grain foods and foods containing whole grains was estimated. The association between the intake of grain food groups and sociodemographic variables was investigated using multiple linear regression models with random intercepts. Results Mean intake of total grain foods and foods containing whole grains was 318.6 g/d and 14.7 g/d, respectively. Total grain foods were less consumed by participants at older ages (-9.8 g/d), and females (-9.9 g/d), and more consumed by those in the lowest socioeconomic category (24.8 g/d). Foods containing whole grains were more consumed by participants at older ages (3.3 g/d), and females (4.0 g/d), while those in the lowest socioeconomic category consumed 2.9 g/d less. Major contributors to energy provided from foods containing whole grains were oatmeal, masa harina, whole-wheat bread, corn chips, and wheat crackers.

Previous AD epidemiologic studies have been mainly retrospective and/or have been performed through surveys instead of in-person visits. Epidemiological studies concerning AD in Latin American countries are scarce. Objective: To describe sociodemographic and clinical features and the economic burden of AD on children and adult patients in Colombia through in-person visits. Methods: This was a cross-sectional study of 212 patients that included sociodemographic and clinimetric data. The diagnostic criteria of Hanifin and Rajka was used and data relating to disease distribution, disease severity (through the BSA: Body surface area; EASI: Eczema Area and Severity Index; SCORAD: Scoring Atopic Dermatitis), Fitzpatrick's skin phototypes, personal and familiar history of allergic diseases, previous treatments, and personal history of comorbidities, was collected. Results: Patient age range was 12–76, and 52.8% were female. Disease distribution was mainly flexural (19.6%). Early age start, Denni-Morgan fold, and infections tendency were more frequent in adolescents compared to adults. Mean age of diagnosis was 12 years old, AD diagnosis was made mostly by a dermatologist, 48.1% (102 patients) reported alcohol consumption, and 59% of consumers were heavy drinkers. Comorbidities found were: chronic rhinitis (68.9%) food allergy (32.5%), allergic conjunctivitis (29.7%), and asthma (28.8%).

Studies assessing the prevalence of systemic hypertension in Colombia have included main cities and small regions. However, there is no available data regarding the country as a whole. Objective: To describe the prevalence of systemic hypertension according to reports made to the official information systems in Colombia. Method: The prevalence of systemic hypertension was calculated through the extraction and analysis of data contained within the SISPRO tool, the official information system for the Colombian Ministry of Health and Social Protection. The prevalence was then standardized by age, and for the different geographical regions of the country in the period comprised between years 2013 and 2017. Results: During the five years of follow-up, we located 12,386,343 registries reporting systemic hypertension as a main diagnosis. The lowest prevalence (4.65%) was found in year 2013, and the highest prevalence (5.83%) was found in 2017. The mean national prevalence for patients above the age of 60, during the aforementioned 5-year period, was 28.14%. The prevalence was higher in women, with a women-to-men ratio of 1.78:1.

The aim of this article is to determine the epidemiology of TC in Colombia. METHODS: A literature review on four databases was performed PubMed, Embase, Lilacs and Scielo. Studies of incidence, prevalence, mortality and survival of TC were taken from different countries. Studies included were published in the last 10 years. RESULTS: 2308 references were reviewed by title and abstract. In search of local references in non-indexedjournals 5 references were extracted. In total 139 references for review in full text were selected. The global incidence and prevalence of cancer varies. In the Northern Europe region, the highest incidence is evident, mainly in Denmark, Croatia and Norway. Followed by Western Europe and South America with Chile. In Colombia the general age incidence is 2,2/100.000, finding a zero incidence in departments such as Choco and Guajira. CONCLUSIONS: A rise in the incidence of TC has been seen globally, this trend mainly in developing countries. In Colombia most studies are crossectional studies.

The public health impact of the coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19) pandemic has motivated a rapid search for potential therapeutics, with some key successes. However, the potential impact of different treatments, and consequently research and procurement priorities, have not been clear. Methods. Using a mathematical model of severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2 (SARS-CoV-2) transmission, COVID-19 disease and clinical care, we explore the public-health impact of different potential therapeutics, under a range of scenarios varying healthcare capacity, epidemic trajectories; and drug efficacy in the absence of supportive care. Results. The impact of drugs like dexamethasone (delivered to the most critically-ill in hospital and whose therapeutic benefit is expected to depend on the availability of supportive care such as oxygen and mechanical ventilation) is likely to be limited in settings where healthcare capacity is lowest or where uncontrolled epidemics result in hospitals being overwhelmed. As such, it may avert 22% of deaths in high-income countries but only 8% in low-income countries (assuming R = 1.35). Therapeutics for different patient populations (those not in hospital, early in the course of infection) and types of benefit (reducing disease severity or infectiousness, preventing hospitalization) could have much greater benefits, particularly in resource-poor settings facing large epidemics. Conclusions. Advances in the treatment of COVID-19 to date have been focused on hospitalized-patients and predicated on an assumption of adequate access to supportive care. Therapeutics delivered earlier in the course of infection that reduce the need for healthcare or reduce infectiousness could have significant impact, and research into their efficacy and means of delivery should be a priority.",Article,"Unknown.; Unknown.; Alvarez, Carlos Arturo.; Unknown.; Unknown.; Unknown.; Chanda, Duncan.; Unknown.; Unknown.; Unknown.; Unknown.; Perez, Zulma Milena Cucunuba.; Unknown.; Unknown.; Unknown.; Unknown.; Unknown.; Unknown.; Unknown.; Unknown.; Unknown.; Unknown.; Unknown.; Unknown.; Unknown.; Unknown.; Unknown.; Unknown.; Unknown.; Unknown.; Unknown.; Unknown.; Unknown.; Unknown.; Unknown.; Unknown.; Unknown.; Unknown.; Unknown.; Unknown.; Unknown.; Unknown.; Unknown.; Unknown.; Unknown.; Unknown.; Unknown.; Unknown.; Valderrama-Beltran, Sandra Liliana.; Unknown.; Unknown.; Unknown.; Unknown",COVID-19;epidemiology;modelling;SARS-CoV-2;therapeutics,COVID-19;epidemiology;modelling;SARS-CoV-2;therapeutics,Thailand;Thailand;Viet Nam;United Kingdom;Ecuador;Thailand;Colombia;Zambia;Zambia;Indonesia;Indonesia;Kenya;Colombia;Brazil;Colombia;Venezuela;Brazil;United Kingdom;India;United Kingdom;United Kingdom;Thailand;United Kingdom;Brazil;United Kingdom;Brazil;Venezuela;United States;Kenya;Brazil;Venezuela;Thailand;Argentina,

The impact of the indwelling urinary catheter on etiologic agents and clinical outcomes has been poorly studied in Latin America. Methods: Cross-sectional study including patients with cUTI, with positive urine culture, treated at Hospital Universitario San Ignacio, Bogotá (Colombia) between 2017 and 2020. Clinical and microbiologic characteristics, treatments and outcomes are explored, comparing those with and without indwelling urinary catheter. Results: Seven hundred thirty-five patients with non-catheter-associated cUTI (NC-cUTI) and 165 with catheter-associated cUTI (CAUTI) were included. CAUTI group had a higher proportion of recurrent UTI (18% vs 33.3%, p < 0.001), ICU requirement (2.7% vs 8.5%, p < 0.001), longer hospital stay (6 vs 10 days, p < 0.001) and > 30 days unplanned readmission rate (5.8% vs 10.3%, p < 0.001).

In some parts of Columbia the disease is endemic, and its incidence appears to be increasing, with outbreaks and sporadic cases of diarrhoea becoming more frequent. We used pulsed-field gel electrophoresis (PFGE) to determine (1) whether the isolates obtained from infectious diarrhoea were identical or different and (2) the extent of generic diversity among the isolates. A molecular characterisation using PFGE of 19 samples of Salmonella enterica from faecal isolates was undertaken on fragments of chromosomal DNA digested by Xbal isolates. Three different patterns were observed by this method. The patterns were quite similar to each other and consisted of 10-14 restriction fragments, each with 50-1000 kbp. These results suggest that the different S. enterica isolates belong to a single clone.",Article,"Unknown.; Mattar, Salim.; Unknown",Colombia;Diarrhoea;Epidemiology;Paediatrics;Pulsed field gel electrophoresis (PFGE);Salmonella spp.,Colombia;Diarrhoea;Epidemiology;Paediatrics;Pulsed field gel electrophoresis (PFGE);Salmonella spp.,Colombia;Colombia,

However, no studies exist that have examined the integration of these 24-hour movement behaviors in Latin America. The purpose of this study was to examine the prevalence of meeting the Canadian 24-Hour Movement Guideline recommendations and sociodemographic correlates of meeting the guidelines in adults from eight Latin American countries. Methods: This was a multi-national cross-sectional study of 2338 adults aged 18 to 64 years from the Latin American Study of Nutrition and Health. MVPA and ST data were collected using accelerometers. Sleep duration was self-reported using a daily log. Socio-demographic correlates included sex, age, education level, and marital status. Meeting the 24-hour movement guidelines was defined as: >= 150 min/week of MVPA; <= 8 h/day of ST; and between 7 and 9 h/day of sleep. Logistic regression models were estimated on pooled data. Results: The prevalence of adults who met the MVPA, ST, sleep duration, and integrated recommendations was 48.3, 22.0, 19.4, and 1.6%, respectively. Overall, being a woman (OR: 0.72; 95%CI: 0.55,0.93) and having a middle (0.63; 0.47,0.85) or high education level (0.31; 0.17,0.56) was associated with lower odds of meeting all three of the 24-hour movement guideline recommendations. Being married (1.70; 1.25,2.29) was associated with greater odds of meeting all three recommendations. Being a woman (0.46; 0.39,0.55), aged 50-64 years (0.77; 0.60,0.97), and married (0.79; 0.65,0.96) were associated with lower odds of meeting the MVPA recommendation. Having a middle (0.64; 0.50,0.80) or high (0.36; 0.23,0.55) education level was associated with lower odds and being married (1.86; 1.46,2.36) was associated with greater odds of meeting the ST recommendation. Being a woman (0.63; 0.51,0.78) was associated with lower odds; whereas being aged 50-64 years (1.40; 1.04,1.88) and having a middle education level (1.37; 1.09,1.73) were associated with greater odds of meeting the sleep duration recommendation. Conclusions: Overall, the proportion of Latin American adults achieving healthy levels of 24-hour movement behaviors was low.

This study used data from ReLAMC registries to quantify the prevalence of microcephaly from 2010 to 2017 (before, during and after the Zika virus epidemic). Design Nine ReLAMC congenital anomaly registries provided case-level data or aggregate data for any live births, still births or terminations of pregnancy with microcephaly. Births to pregnant women infected with Zika virus first occurred in Brazil in 2015, and in the remaining registry areas in 2016 with the exception of Chile that did not experience Zika virus. Therefore the prevalence of microcephaly for 2010-2014 and individual years 2015, 2016 and 2017 was estimated using multilevel random effect Poisson models. Clinical classification and characteristics of the cases were compared pre and post Zika for all centres providing individual case-level data. Results The prevalence of microcephaly for all registries excluding Brazil was 2.3 per 10 000 (95% CI 2.0 to 2.6) for 2010-2014 rising to 5.4 (95% CI 4.8 to 6.0) in 2016 and 5.9 (95% CI 5.3 to 6.6) in 2017. Brazil had a prevalence of 0.6 per 10 000 (95% CI 0.5 to 0.6) in 2010-2014, rising to 5.8 (95% CI 5.6 to 6.1) in 2015, 8.0 (95% CI 7.6 to 8.3) in 2016 and then falling in 2017.

This characterization allows prioritizing populations with specific risks, programming the use of health services, and planning the costs necessary to guarantee equitable care. Objective To assess the demographic and clinical characteristics of a cohort of patients with rheumatoid arthritis using national data collected by the High-Cost Disease Fund (CAC in Spanish). Methods A cross-sectional study from a secondary source. Data was gathered from a national administrative registry. A descriptive analysis was performed on sociodemographic and clinical characteristics. Age-standardized prevalence was estimated at national level and by geographical regions. Remission rates were also estimated for Colombian departments and regions. Results By 2019, 81,386 patients with rheumatoid arthritis were reported in Colombia. The relation female-male was 5.2:1. The median age was 59 years (IQR: 50-67). Prevalence was higher in people aged 50-69 years. The most frequent comorbidities were high blood pressure (31.15%) and osteoporosis (19.46%). Age-standardized prevalence of rheumatoid arthritis was 0.24 per 100 population (95% CI: 0.23-0.24). In cases with complete information, 57.57% of departments had remission rates up to 30%.

Methods Based on age-specific and sex-specific data on colorectal cancer incidence, data from population-based surveys for the exposure data and population projections, the macrosimulation model Prevent V.3.01 was used to model expected colorectal cancer incidence for the period 2016-2050. Baseline models were those where exposure levels were not subject to change because of interventions. Two intervention scenarios were specified: one with elimination of exposure to the risk factor as of 2017 and a second one where over a 10-year period the current prevalence data gradually declined until they reach 90% of the 2016 levels. Results Under the reference scenarios, a total number of 274 637 colorectal cancers would be expected to occur in the period 2016-2050. Under the scenario of 10% gradual decline in the prevalence of alcohol and tobacco consumption, physical inactivity and high body mass index, a total of 618, 488, 2954 and 2086 new cases, respectively, would be avoided. Under scenarios of elimination, these numbers of avoided cases would be 6908 (elimination alcohol), 6104 (elimination tobacco), 16 637 (optimizing physical inactivity) and 25 089 (all on ideal weight). Conclusions In order to reduce the burden of colorectal cancer, it is important to take measures to halt the current trends of increasing sedentary behaviour and overweight in the Colombian population.

Design Retrospective cohort study. Setting Database reports of events related to services that insurers provided (Health Promoter Enterprises, EPS in Spanish) in the Colombian health system, which covered 22.19 million residents in 2016. Participants The study cohort comprised 3 849 849 patients aged 18 years and up admitted to the Colombian hospitals between 1 January and 31 December 2016. Primary outcome The study aimed to gauge the CCI's predictive value for mortality by comparing the calibration and discrimination of three different versions of the index, with mortality information obtained from death certificates, including date of death and diagnoses associated with cause of death. Follow-up was conducted for at least 1 year. Results Altogether, 46 429 patients died within 1 year (1.21%). Discriminatory power in predicting 1-year mortality was calculated for three versions of the ICC. In the original CCI model, the area under the Receiver operating characteristic (ROC) curve was 0.906 (95% CI (0.906 to 0.907), p<0.001). In the version for Colombia, it was 0.908 (95% CI (0.908 to 0.909), p<0.001) and for the new model it was 0.909 (95% CI (0.908 to 0.910), p<0.001).

Methods: A study of external validation in a historical cohort, which included patients hospitalized between 2006 and 2012 in the Hospital Universitario San Ignacio in Bogota Colombia, wasper formed. Medical records of patients older than 18 years, who had been diagnosed as acute myocardial infarction without ST segment elevation, were included. The number of events(bleeding) predicted and observed during hospitalization (calibration) were compared. Finally, the ability to separate subjects at high and low risk (discrimination) was estimated. Results: 252 patients were included. The number of major events was 30 (11.9%) and that of minor events 23 (9.12%); 12 patients (7.46%) died. In the group of very high risk (more than 50 points on the scale), the largest number of events (regarding the study population)was reported. At assessing the scale, a good calibration capacity was evidenced (X2 p =.84); however, discrimination was not adequate (0.6128 AUC [95% CI 0.46 to 0.76]). Conclusions: Few events were found, although the data suggest that the scale slightly underestimates the risks. The scale has good calibration, but lacks adequate discriminatory capacity, probably due to the fact that a small number of events with high standard deviations were obtained. Therefore, further studies with greater statistical power are required.",Article,"Garcia-Pena, Angel Alberto.; Munoz, Oscar Mauricio.; Urrea Zapata, Juan Karlo.; Unknown",Acute coronary syndrome without ST elevation;Epidemiology;Hemorrhage,Acute coronary syndrome without ST elevation;Epidemiology;Hemorrhage,Colombia;Colombia;Colombia,

Design We conducted a multicentre cross-sectional study to collect physical activity and built environment data. The levels of physical activity were calculated through the International Physical Activity Questionnaire survey. Using the Neighbourhood Environment Walkability Scale-Abbreviated, characteristics of the built environment were measured through three domains: accessibility, microinfrastructure and security. To estimate the association of the built environment and physical activity, we used mixed effects logistic regression analysis. In addition, likelihood ratio test to account for clustered effect within countries and/or cities was used. Setting Eight countries in LA. Participants Adults aged 15-65 years (n=9218) living in urban areas and consented to participate of the Latin American Study of Nutrition and Health. Results Most of the population in LA had access to a grocery store (97.2%), public transport stop (91.5%) and children's playground (81.6%). Metropolitan parks were more accessible in Ecuador (59.8%) and Colombia (59.2%) than in Venezuela (33.5%). Individuals located within 20 min of walking from sport facilities or children's playground areas were more likely to perform moderate-to-high physical activity OR 1.20 (95% CI 1.06 to 1.36) and OR 1.25 (95% CI 1.02 to 1.53), respectively. Only 14.5% of the population from the region considered that their neighbourhood had an adequate design for walking or cycling. Likewise, among adults living in LA, only 39.75% had the perception of living in a safe neighbourhood.

Methods: Retrospective case series of patients with scleritis from 2015 to 2020. Clinical records were obtained from seven uveitis referral centers in Colombia. Patients with a diagnosis of episcleritis were excluded. Results: We evaluated 389 patients with scleritis (509 eyes). There was a female predominance (75.6%) with a mean age of 51 ± 15 years. Most cases were noninfectious (94.8%) and unilateral (69.2%). The most frequent type of inflammation was diffuse anterior scleritis (41.7%), followed by nodular scleritis (31.9%) and necrotizing scleritis (12.3%). Systemic autoimmune diseases were found in 41.3% of patients, the most common being rheumatoid arthritis (18.5%) and granulomatosis with polyangiitis (5.9%). Polyautoimmunity was found in 10.4% of those with a systemic autoimmune disease. The most frequent treatment was systemic steroids (50.9%), followed by systemic NSAIDs (32.4%). Steroid-sparing immunosuppression was required in 49.1% of patients. Systemic autoimmune diseases were more common in patients with necrotizing scleritis and those older than 40 years of age. Best-corrected visual acuity of 20/80 or worse at presentation was more common in necrotizing scleritis and subjects with associated uveitis, ocular hypertension, or who were over 40 years of age. Conclusions: This is the first study in Colombia and the largest in Latin America describing the clinical characteristics and presentation patterns of scleritis. The most common presentation was in females, with unilateral, anterior diffuse noninfectious scleritis.

Objectives To describe the sociodemographic and clinical features and the economic burden of psoriasis among children and adult patients from Colombia. Methods This cross-sectional study included patients from dermatology private practice offic-es, health provider institutions and hospitals in seven Colombian cities. We collected data on disease distribution, weight, height, body mass index, waist-hip ratio, disease severity, therapy, personal history of comorbidities, and direct costs. Multiple logis-tic regression analyses were conducted to assess the associations between severity scales and sociodemographic and clinical variables. Results Two-hundred-three patients (43.8% women, 56.2% men) with an age range between 7 to 89 years old were included. The main subtype was psoriasis vulgaris and mean age of diagnosis was 37.1 years. The most common comorbidities were obesity, hypertension, psoriatic arthritis, dyslipidemia and diabetes. Women had a significant increased odds of presenting with psoriatic arthritis. Body-mass-index and hypertension were significantly associated with a higher psoriasis severity, whereas being fe-male and non-obese was associated with a lower risk. A third of the patients had a family history of psoriasis and sleeping disorders. Forty-one percent of participants either had no income or had an income below 224 US dollars per month and >20% of their income was spent on their disease. Conclusions This study is supported by robust scientific data and contributes to understanding the burden of psoriasis in Latin America.

There is an apparent relationship between the development of countries and the epidemiology of cancer; the objective of this article is to observe the epidemiology of bladder cancer in our environment respect to other countries and to describe the possible associated factors. Methods A review of the literature was performed in four databases: Medline, Embase, Cochrane database and Lilacs. Studies about Incidence, prevalence, mortality, survival and burden of disease, published in the past 5 years, were included. Results 7806 references were found that were discriminated by title and abstract, 44 references in full text were included at the end. Different incidence and mortality rates were observed, the highest being found in Europe mainly in the Czech Republic followed by North America. In Colombia, the general incidence was 6.8 / 100,000 in men and 2.1 / 100,000 in women between 2003 and 2007, finding low numbers in departments such as Guajira. Conclusions There has been an increase in the incidence and mortality of bladder cancer worldwide. There seems to be an association with smoking and diet, as well as with the Human Development Index. There is little information in Latin America; in Colombia, observing the data of some departments and the distribution of specialists in the different regions a sub-register can be consider, making necessary to improve surveillance systems, as well as health policies for the diagnosis and early intervention of cancer.",Article,"Medina-Rico, Mauricio.; Unknown.; Unknown.; Prada, Juan.; Lopez-Ramos, Hugo Enrique",Bladder cancer;Epidemiology;Incidence;Mortality;Prevalence;Survival rate,Bladder cancer;Epidemiology;Incidence;Mortality;Prevalence;Survival rate,Colombia,

Upper limb trauma accounts for 10% to 40% of emergency department visits in North America and Europe and can cause significant temporary or permanent disability. After searching the local literature, the authors did not find any studies regarding the epidemiological data of upper limb trauma in regional literature in Medellín, Colombia. The objective of this study was to describe the epidemiological characteristics of upper limb trauma in 6 local health care institutions during a 1-year period. Methods. Retrospective, multicenter study, the institutional databases of all adult patients presenting to the emergency departments of 6 reference institutions in Medellín, Colombia, from January to December 2016 with any codes for upper extremity trauma were analyzed. Variables such as: national identity number, gender, age, code of the International Classification of Diseases and the insurance company were identified. Analysis of the demographic and clinical characteristics of the study patients was performed for the entire sample and by institutions, and a qualitative exploratory analysis was performed to identify differences between demographic and clinical variables. Results. There were 259.163 consultations found for all causes and 25.646 consultations for upper limb trauma (9.89%); 66.4% were in the group of 18 to 39 years and 70.74% were men. The most frequent types of trauma were wounds and contusions (68.1%), followed by fractures (17.1%). Trauma most frequently occurred in the hand (including the fingers) (31%) and due to work-related accidents (33%). Conclusions. Upper limb trauma represents a major cause of morbidity in our local institutions. The results of this study are consistent with previously published papers.

Disease symptoms are nonspecific and, therefore, their clinical diagnosis is difficult. Indirect immunofluorescence (IFA) is the gold standard assay for diagnosis. The interest for conducting studies on these pathologies has resurfaced in Colombia since 2001; besides, previous studies have evidenced cases of rickettsiosis in the north of the department of Caldas. Objective: To establish the frequency of antibodies and seroconversion against Rickettsia spp. In patients consulting health institutions in Caldas, Colombia, from 2016 to 2019. Materials and methods: We conducted a quantitative, observational, and descriptive study on a non-probabilistic sample of 175 patients with symptoms compatible with rickettsiosis who consulted in different municipalities of Caldas, Colombia; IFA was performed to detect antibodies in the acute and convalescent phases against Rickettsia rickettsii, Rickettsia typhi, and Rickettsia felis. Results: The average age of the patients was 31 years. The municipalities with the highest proportion of seropositive cases were Belalcazar, Chinchina, Filadelfia, La Dorada, La Merced, and Manizales; 66% of patients owned pets and 12% reported arthropod bites. The most frequent signs and symptoms were headache (69.7%), arthromyalgia (60%), and fever (58.2%). IgG seroprevalence was 60% for R. rickettsii, 47.9% for R. typhi, and, and 24% for R. felis.

The etiology of this disease is related to the human papilloma virus, alcohol and cigarette use. This study tries to quantify the effect on oral cancer incidence of a hypothetical change in the prevalence of these risk factors in the period 2015-2050. Methods: macrosimulation models based on secondary data. Results: According to the simulated scenarios, elimination of cigarette and alcohol use and elimination of infection by the human papillomavirus in the Colombian population, would probably prevent 27.6 % to 82.1 % of all new cases of oral cavity cancer expected to occur in the period 2015-2050. Conclusions: according to the projections produced by the World Health Organization and the models we specified, there will be a potential increase in the number of new patients diagnosed with oral cavity cancer associated with the use of alcohol and a low impact of the interventions currently in place. It will be necessary to implement measures to descrease alcohol consumption and sustain current efforts to reduce cigarette use.

The epidemiology of Hodgkin lymphoma has always been a source of fascination to researchers due to its heterogeneous characteristics. Since 1993 in Colombia, the coverage of health services has been extended, and there is now an extensive registry of healthcare processes through the Social Protection Comprehensive Information System. The aim of our study was to calculate the prevalence, and describe the demographic characteristics, of Hodgkin lymphoma in Colombia. Material and methods: This is a descriptive cross-sectional study with data from the Comprehensive Social Protection Information System of the Ministry of Health of Colombia between 2015 and 2019. Results: 4,396 cases were identified, giving a prevalence of 8.9 per 100,000 inhabitants; of these, 55% were men, with a male:female ratio of 1.2:1, with a higher prevalence in the 75–79 years age group. The departments with the highest prevalence were Risaralda (13.33), Bogotá D.C. (13.30), Boyacá (11.9), Quindío (11.49) and Santander (11.44). Conclusions: Our prevalence is higher than that reported based on population-based cancer registries in Colombia 5.4 per 100,000 inhabitants between 2016 and 2020.

The use of indexes and additional variables in their interpretation could improve prediction of cardiovascular outcomes. Methods By conducting a descriptive, analytical and retrospective study, the relationship and prediction ability of the slope ST/HR and ΔST/ΔHR indexes with the development of cardiovascular events were assessed at one year. Out of a total of 438 studies, 138 were selected that complied with the evaluation criteria. A descriptive analysis of the variables of interest was carried out, and later on a univariate and multivariate analysis of the different variables and outcomes of interest. Conclusions A statistically significant relationship was found between exercise capacity, ST/HR slope index and the development of cardiovascular events, without findings of a significant relationship with the ΔST/ΔHR slope index.

The number of specialists in this field, however, seems insufficient. No recent studies have diagnosed the attributes of rheumatology training in Latin America. Methods This is a descriptive cross-sectional study. We obtained data on each country through local rheumatologists of the Pan-American League Against Rheumatism, who acted as principal investigators for participating countries. Our sample was analyzed and described through means and standard deviations or through frequencies and percentages, depending on the variable. Results Countries with the most rheumatology-training programs were Brazil (n = 50), Argentina (n = 18), and Mexico (n = 15). Ecuador, Honduras, and Nicaragua do not have rheumatology-training programs. The countries with the most available slots for rheumatology residents were Brazil (n = 126) and Argentina (n = 36). To be admitted into rheumatology training, candidates were required to have completed graduate studies in internal medicine in 42.1% of the programs. In 8 countries (42.1%), residents are not required to pay tuition; the median cost of tuition in the remaining countries is US $528 (interquartile range, US $2153). Conclusions Conditions associated with rheumatology training in Latin America vary. Significant differences exist in income and tuition fees for residents, for example, and 4 countries in Latin America do not currently offer programs.

In Colombia, there are few reports on the epidemiology of brain tumors, and those that exist are from local databases that don ' t have a rigorous and massive registry. Aim: To determine the survival rates of brain tumors in Colombia. Methods: A retrospective descriptive observational study was conducted, using databases of population-based cancer registries in Colombia. We extracted information from 2003-2012 of patients with tumors without age group restriction. The survival rates were calculated, using the Kaplan-Meier method and the statistical software Stata 14.0. Results: From 2003-2012, 775 adult patients and 123 pediatric patients were reported with a new central nervous system tumor diagnosis in the four cities. The most frequent tumors in the pediatric age group were neuroepithelial tumors, embryonal tumors and ependymal tumors; whereas for adults, the most frequent were neuroepithelial tumors, meningiomas and hematolymphoid tumors. The global survival rate at 6 months, 1 year, 2 years and 3 years, were approximately 49.9%, 35.2%, 21.4% and 15.3% in the pediatric population, and 70.2%, 58.9%, 43.3% and 35.4% in the adult population. Conclusions: The present work constitutes the most recent and multicentric study on the epidemiology of brain tumors in Colombia. There was a clear underreport of this type of tumor and inferior rates compared to universal literature. Despite this, these results will help to widen data recollection and coverage in population-based cancer registries.

This study aimed to examine the associations between walking and cycling as form active transportation and obesity indicators in Latin American adolescents. Methods: Population-based study with 671 adolescents (mean age: 15.9 [standard deviation: 0.8] years) from eight countries participating in the Latin American Study of Nutrition and Health/Estudio Latino Americano Nutrition y Salud (ELANS). Walking and cycling for active transportation were measured using the International Physical Activity Questionnaire long version. Body mass index, waist circumference, neck circumference, and relative fat mass were used as obesity indicators. Associations were estimated using logistic regression models for the pooled data adjusted for country, sex, age, socio-economic levels, race/ethnicity, leisure-time physical activity and energy intake. Results: Mean time spent walking and cycling was 22.6 (SD: 33.1) and 5.1 (SD: 24.1) min/day, respectively. The median values were 12.8 (IQR: 4.2; 25.7) and 0 (IQR: 0; 6.2) for walking and cycling. Participants reporting ≥ 10 min/week of walking or cycling for active transportation were 84.2% and 15.5%, respectively. Costa Rica (94.3% and 28.6%) showed the highest prevalence for walking and cycling, respectively, while Venezuela (68.3% and 2.4%) showed the lowest prevalence. There was no significant association between walking for active transportation and any obesity indicator. In the overall sample, cycling for ≥ 10 min/week was significantly associated with a lower likelihood of overweight/obesity based on BMI (OR: 0.86; 95%CI: 0.88; 0.94) and waist circumference (OR: 0.90; 95%CI: 0.83; 0.97) adjusted for country, sex, age, socio-economic level, race/ethnicity, leisure-time physical activity and energy intake compared to cycling for < 10 min/week. There were no significant associations between cycling for active transportation and neck circumference as well as relative fat mass. Conclusions: Cycling for active transportation was negatively associated with obesity indicators, especially body mass index and waist circumference. Programs for promoting cycling for active transportation could be a feasible strategy to tackle the high obesity rates in adolescents in Latin America.

For developing countries to indigenize health research systems, it is essential to build research capacity. We review the positive features and weaknesses of various approaches to capacity building, emphasizing that complementary approaches to human resource development work best in the context of a systems and long-term perspective. As a key element of capacity building, countries must also address issues related to the enabling environment, in particular: leadership, career structure, critical mass, infrastructure, information access and interfaces between research producers and users. The success of efforts to build capacity in developing countries will ultimately depend on political will and credibility, adequate financing, and a responsive capacity-building plan that is based on a thorough situational analysis of the resources needed for health research and the inequities and gaps in health care.

The MMSE was examined as total score (0-30) or divided into 2 global domains: (1) no-memory (score 0-24): Orientation, attention, and language; and (2) memory (score 0-6): working and delayed memory. Mean age and total MMSE were 72.7 years and 24.6 at baseline, and 81.7 years and 20.5 at 11 years of follow-up. Spanish-speaking participants had less education (4.1 vs 7.4 years, P < .0001), they had significantly higher adjusted mean scores for memory, no-memory, and total MMSE compared with English-speaking participants. In multivariate longitudinal analyses, participants with more years of education performed better than those with less education, especially in total MMSE and no-memory domain.

Methods The International Diabetes Management Practices Study provides real-world evidence of patient profiles and diabetes care practices in developing countries in seven cross-sectional waves (2005-2017). At each wave, each physician collected data from ten consecutive participants with type 2 diabetes during a 2 week period. The primary objective of this analysis was to evaluate trends of glycaemic control over time. Results A total of 66,088 individuals with type 2 diabetes were recruited by 6099 physicians from 49 countries. The proportion of participants with HbA(1c) <53 mmol/mol (<7%) decreased from 36% in wave 1 (2005) to 30.1% in wave 7 (2017) (p < 0.0001). Compared with wave 1, the adjusted ORs of attaining HbA(1c) <= 64 mmol/mol (<= 8%) decreased significantly in waves 2, 5, 6 and 7 (p < 0.05). Over 80% of participants received oral glucose-lowering drugs, with declining use of sulfonylureas. Insulin use increased from 32.8% (wave 1) to 41.2% (wave 7) (p < 0.0001). The corresponding time to insulin initiation (mean +/- SD) changed from 8.4 +/- 6.9 in wave 1 to 8.3 +/- 6.6 years in wave 7, while daily insulin dosage ranged from 0.39 +/- 0.21 U/kg (wave 1) to 0.33 +/- 0.19 U/kg (wave 7) for basal regimen and 0.70 +/- 0.34 U/kg (wave 1) to 0.77 +/- 0.33 (wave 7) U/kg for basal-bolus regimen. An increasing proportion of participants had >= 2 HbA(1c) measurements within 12 months of enrolment (from 61.8% to 92.9%), and the proportion of participants receiving diabetes education (mainly delivered by physicians) also increased from 59.0% to 78.3%.

Methods. - This cross-sectional study and longitudinal follow-up describe the data (demographic and socioeconomic profiles, clinical characteristics, treatment of hyperglycaemia and associated cardiovascular risk factors, resource consumption) collected during the second phase (2006) of the International Diabetes Management Practices Study (IDMPS). Patients received diabetes education directly from the practice nurse, dietitian or educator, or were referred to ad hoc group-education programmes; all programmes emphasized healthy lifestyle changes, self-care and active participation in disease control and treatment. Educated vs non-educated T2DM patients (n = 5692 in each group), paired by age, gender and diabetes duration, were randomly recruited for the IDMPS by participating primary-care physicians from 27 countries in Eastern Europe, Asia, Latin America and Africa. Outcome measures included clinical (body weight, height, waist circumference, blood pressure, foot evaluation), metabolic (HbA(1c) levels, blood lipid profile) and biochemical control measures. Treatment goals were defined according to American Diabetes Association guidelines. Results. - T2DM patients' education significantly improved the percentage of patients achieving target values set by international guidelines. Educated patients increased their insulin use and self-care performance, had a lower rate of chronic complications and a modest increase in cost of care, and probably higher salaries and slightly better productivity. Conclusion. - Diabetes education is an efficient tool for improving, care outcomes without having a major impact on healthcare costs. (C) 2011 Elsevier Masson SAS.

Using a new technique which measures the effects of changes in the quantities and prices of individual dimension of human capital on overall wage inequality, we identify changes in wage premiums associated with more education as an important cause of the different inequality outcomes. We present evidence that the different education price effects were due to different rates of growth in the demand for more-educated workers. Furthermore, inequality increased in Chile despite a large equalizing education quantity effect. (C) 2001 Elsevier Science Ltd.

However, many studies have confirmed the lack of knowledge as to how to act in these cases. The aim of this study was to determine the knowledge in regard to dental trauma of school teachers in Colombia. Materials and MethodsA multicentre, descriptive cross-sectional study was performed in 251 schools using a stratified randomized sampling. A structured hard copy survey was personally delivered to 2390 school teachers in the selected schools. The survey contained questions related to work experience, teaching level and demographic data, as well as questions related to their knowledge of and attitude towards emergency dental trauma management. ResultsThe response rate was 96%. Most of the school teachers (95%) had never received training related to dental trauma, although 35% had witnessed at least 1 case. Of 2296 school teachers surveyed, only 5.8% would have replanted an avulsed tooth. An association was found between work experience and appropriate management of an avulsed tooth. No significant differences were found in regard to school location (city), school type (private/public), gender and school teachers' education level.

Objectives: This study set out to describe nurses' roles in the prevention and management of CINV and to identify any gaps that exist across countries. Methods: A self-reported survey was completed by 458 registered nurses who administered chemotherapy to cancer patients in Australia, China, Hong Kong, and 9 Latin American countries. Results: More than one-third of participants regarded their own knowledge of CINV as fair to poor. Most participants (965%) agreed that chemotherapy-induced nausea and chemotherapy-induced vomiting should be considered separately (79%), but only 35% were confident in their ability to manage chemotherapy-induced nausea (53%) or chemotherapy-induced vomiting (59%). Only one-fifth reported frequent use of a standardized CINV assessment tool and only a quarter used international clinical guidelines to manage CINV. Conclusions: Participants perceived their own knowledge of CINV management to be insufficient. They recognized the need to develop and use a standardized CINV assessment tool and the importance of adopting international guidelines to inform the management of CINV. Implications for Practice: Findings indicate that international guidelines should be made available to nurses in clinically relevant and easily accessible formats, that a review of chemotherapy assessment tools should be undertaken to identify reliable and valid measures amenable to use in a clinical settings, and that a CINV risk screening tool should be developed as a prompt for nurses to enable timely identification of and intervention for patients at high risk of CINV.",Article,"Krishnasamy, M.; So, W.K.W.; Yates, P.; de Calvo, L.E.A.; Annab, R.; Wisniewski, T.; Aranda, S.",Cancer; Chemotherapy-induced nausea and vomiting; Education; Nurses,Cancer;Chemotherapy-induced nausea and vomiting;Education;Nurses,Australia;China;Colombia;United States,2-s2.0-84902660535

Methods: This is a secondary analysis of the SABE/2012 Bogota survey; a cross-sectional study including 2000 subjects aged >= 60years. The MoCA test was the dependent variable and was stratified by cognitive domains, incorrect answers and scores were considered. Educational level was assessed through years of formal education. Age, sex and selected medical conditions were also included to adjust the multivariate models. Bivariate analyses, fitted logistic and linear regression models were employed for analyzing association between these variables. Results: The proportion of incorrect answers increased as schooling years decreased and as age increased. In the multivariate analysis, visuospatial and executive function were the most affected domains. Educational level displayed less influence than age on short memory-recall task (standardized beta 0.19 vs -0.24). Educational level showed a greater influence than age on no-memory tasks (the sum of all other domains; standardized beta 0.50 vs -0.29). Conclusions: It seems logical to consider that performance in most domains of the MoCA is influenced by years of education. Therefore, low scores on these tasks could lead to low total MoCA scores and thus to bias and over diagnosis of cognitive impairment in patients with lower educational levels. Memory-recall domain is not affected much by education and applying it separately could be useful in patients with low educational level in whom we suspect memory impairment.",Article,"Borda, M.G.; Reyes-Ortiz, C.; Perez-Zepeda, M.U.; Patino-Hernandez, D.; Gomez-Arteaga, C.; Cano-Gutierrez, C.A.",Dementia and cognitive disorders; age associated memory problems; education; screening and diagnosis,Dementia and cognitive disorders;age associated memory problems;education;screening and diagnosis;MENTAL-STATE-EXAMINATION;ASSESSMENT MOCA;SCREENING TOOL;VALIDATION;IMPAIRMENT;DEMENTIA;POPULATION;SPANISH;VERSION;BOGOTA,Colombia;Norway;United States;Mexico,2-s2.0-85057303364

Through an online survey, we explored whether restoration professionals in Latin America have been trained on the ecological, socioeconomic, and management dimensions of ecological restoration, and their perceptions of training constraints and curricula needs. Half of the 411 respondents simultaneously work in academia, governments, and nongovernmental organizations, lessening the typical division between the science and practice of restoration, and suggesting the need for stronger multidimensional training to adequately respond to different needs and expectations. Over 80% received formal academic training in fields relevant for restoration and most respondents also reported attending interdisciplinary courses. Training was more focused on the ecological dimension of restoration compared to socioeconomic or management dimensions. Respondents have similar education levels (i.e. most respondents have postgraduate degrees), independently from the organization type in which respondents work, and multidimensionality among organization types was slight. Professionals expressed a need for training opportunities not demanding full-time dedication. Although increasing training opportunities in socioeconomic and management dimensions is needed, we highlight opportunities to reinforce multidimensional training on restoration through organizational and institutional training, and collaborations among organizations.",Article,"Meli, P.; Schweizer, D.; Brancalion, P.H.S.; Murcia, C.; Guariguata, M.R.",capacity building; ecological restoration; education; multiple dimensions of restoration; restoration practice; restoration training; social perceptions,capacity building;ecological restoration;education;multiple dimensions of restoration;restoration practice;restoration training;social perceptions;APPLIED NUCLEATION;UNITED-STATES;FOREST;STRAIGHTFORWARD;OPPORTUNITIES;CAPACITY;SCIENCE,Brazil;Spain;Switzerland;Colombia;United States;Peru,2-s2.0-85062891440

The results of this double aging process are especially striking for health care services because of the concurrent epidemiologic transition, which has led to infectious diseases being replaced by noninfectious, habitually chronic diseases that occur predominantly in older age. In these circumstances, older adults begin to predominate among the patients whom physicians in Latin America now serve and in the near future, older adults will constitute the immense majority of those patients. To respond to this situation, the training of professionals responsible for providing care to older adults should be improved, and the preparation of specialists in geriatric medicine should be enhanced both quantitatively and qualitatively. Future doctors should have the knowledge, abilities, and attitudes to enable them to appropriately serve this population segment. With these aims in mind, structures and procedures should be established that make it possible to impart the specific contents of geriatric medicine during medical school not only as a part of the traditional vertical teaching of the core curriculum of geriatric medicine, but also through the horizontal teaching of some of the material in other subjects. This article discusses why, with what objectives, with what contents, with what procedures, and with what staffing and materials the training of professionals in geriatric medicine should be carried out, and why it is time to give priority to this undertaking.

In this observational study, carried out in a medical school in Colombia, we developed a survey to explore the association between misconduct and stress, potential stressors and other possible contributing factors, such as sex, age and academic year. Of the 433 students that responded to our survey, 97.9% did not fully disagree with at least one of the mentioned misconducts and 99.8% admitted to at least one transgression. Based on a scale we developed, 61.4% of the students consistently agreed with misconduct and 44.9% frequently engaged in misconduct. A logistic regression model suggests that being male (OR 1.90, CI 95% 1.27-2.84) and stress (OR 1.04, CI 95% 1.01-1.06) may increase the likelihood of misconduct. In a subgroup of students, excluding those in their last year of studies, higher academic semester (OR 1.25, CI 95%: 1.10-1.42) may also be a risk factor for misconduct. Most of the observed variation in the data, however, is not explained by these factors.

However, most existing research does not explicitly consider socio-cultural aspects, which differ between developing and developed countries. In this paper, we describe a multidisciplinary research line on technology-based assistive solutions for motor disabilities involving institutions in Colombia and Switzerland. The key aspect of our approach is the involvement of engineers, therapists, designers and end-users from early stages of the design process. This allowed us to characterize the local population with motor disabilities, highlighting a large incidence of violence- related injuries, reduced accessibility to assistive technologies and a perception of social exclusion. In the quest for context- suited solutions, we have developed a mechanical wheelchair and a sensorized facility for motor rehabilitation. The prototypes of these devices will be tested in the upcoming months.

The MPC calculates an optimal charging sequence at each time step of the prediction horizon, but it applies the control signal only for the first step of the sequence, following a receding horizon strategy. The results of the MPC strategy lead to track a dayahead scheduling by considering uncertainties on the EV arrival state of charge, and generation disturbances.

Methods: Using Colombian national mortality statistics, we calculated age-standardized mortality rates (ASMR) as well as age-specific rates per 100,000 person-years, applying redistribution factors according to international recommendations. We imputed missing data for educational level. Multivariate Poisson regression models were constructed to incorporate age and educational level as independent variables. To assess changes in educational inequalities, we estimated the Relative Index of Inequality (RII). All estimates were also evaluated over time, resulting in estimated annual percent changes (EAPC). Results: Over time, cervical cancer mortality declined rapidly up to 2013 (EAPC = - 5.4%, ASMR 27.2 in 1998, 12.5 in 2013), after which ASMR stabilized. This pattern was present in all but the youngest age group and in all educational levels, but much stronger initial declines were observed among women with tertiary education (EAPC = - 8.3%) compared with those with primary (EAPC = - 4.0%) and secondary (EAPC = - 3.4%) educational levels.

In this paper, we describe the experience of a Colombian reference center for the research, diagnosis, training and education on IEM. During the last 20 years, important advances have been achieved in the clinical knowledge of these disorders, as well as in the local availability of several diagnosis tests. Organic acidurias have been the most frequently detected diseases, followed by aminoacidopathies and peroxisomal disorders. Research efforts have been focused in the production of recombinant proteins in microorganisms towards the development of new enzyme replacement therapies, the design of gene therapy vectors and the use of bioinformatics tools for the understanding of IEM. In addition, this center has participated in the education and training of a large number professionals at different levels, which has contributed to increase the knowledge and divulgation of these disorders along the country. Noteworthy, in close collaboration with patient advocacy groups, we have participated in the discussion and construction of initiatives for the inclusion of diagnosis tests and treatments in the health system.",Review,"Echeverri, O.Y.; Guevara, J.M.; Espejo-Mojica, A.J.; Ardila, A.; Pulido, N.; Reyes, M.; Rodriguez-Lopez, A.; Almeciga-Diaz, C.J.; Barrera, L.A.",Inborn errors of metabolism; Colombia; Latin America; Research; Education; Diagnosis; Training; Rare diseases,Inborn errors of metabolism;Colombia;Latin America;Research;Education;Diagnosis;Training;Rare diseases;RECOMBINANT N-ACETYLGALACTOSAMINE-6-SULFATE SULFATASE;ENZYME REPLACEMENT THERAPY;TANDEM MASS-SPECTROMETRY;NEWBORN;EXPRESSION;MORQUIO;COLI;DISEASE;BONE,Colombia,2-s2.0-85051730509

Collaboration platforms have been proposed to support cooperation between people, however it is not easy to incorporate at the same time aspects as: semantic and structured communication, people diversity, adaptation to the context, group awareness, and resource management in a distributed and mobile environment. The Ayllu model for collaboration uses software agents as mediators between people that behave as cooperative rational agents. This approach has the advantage of making interactions semantic oriented and properly structured by the use of well-defined interaction protocols. However, for real world situations, these features are not enough to support the requirements of group work. In this paper, the complete general Ayllu architecture for collaboration is presented. This architecture, not only includes components to apply the Ayllu cooperative approach, but also to provide personalization, context adaptation, awareness, and resource management. All the components have been designated to work in a coherent way in a distributed cooperative environment. The Ayllu platform is designed to be a general collaboration framework that can be easily adapted for specific domains; in this paper the case of study is the education one. © 2012 IADIS.",Conference Paper,"Arias-Baez, Maria Paula.; Torres-Ribero, Luis Guillermo.; Carrillo-Ramos, Angela.; Pomares-Quimbaya, Alexandra.; Gonzalez, Enrique",Adaptation;Agent Platform;Collaboration;Distributed System;Education;Resource Management,Adaptation;Agent Platform;Collaboration;Distributed System;Education;Resource Management,Colombia,

According with Andrés Fernández et al in their report called “e-Health in Latin America and the Caribbean: progress and challenges” published in 2011, due to the greater population ageing and the increase in the prevalence of chronic illnesses in Latin America, new technologies in healthcare emerged and showed to be more effective supporting the national health services. In addition, during the 1980s major reforms were made by the goverments in the health systems in the regions, to improve access to health care which lead to the use of new technologies such as ICTs to improve the data storage, aggregate and analyze data, clinical and health information, to increase efficiency and to support decision making in any health organization [1]. In order to accomplish these improvements it was necessary to have properly medical and technical trained professionals, facilities and medical devices with the required standards; as a result new biomedical engineering and bioengineering programs emerged and curriculums were updated to fit the needs of each region. Nowadays, Latin America has 60 Biomedical Engineering and Bioengineering programs stablished [2][3][4]. Regarding the accreditation, each government has an accreditation program for their universities. This programs were built in order to guarantee a high educational system standard. For international accreditation the most implemented system is ABET (Accreditation Board for Engineering and Technology).

Central and South America, with the exception of Chile, Uruguay and the French Guiana, show high rates of corruption. This study sought to find the meanings that ordinary people attach to corruption as well as the relationship between their narratives and sociodemographic characteristics, such as sex and educational level, and political standpoints, such as their political party affiliation. A total of 325 people participated, 166 females aged 18-69 (M = 35.58, SD = 13.44) and 159 males aged 19-74 (M = 36.09, SD = 13.02). All education levels (primary, secondary, technical, university, postgraduate and none) were represented in the sample. Narratives were analysed via uni- and multidimensional methods and using the SPAD software programme. Variables used for the analysis were: meaning of corruption, corruption cases, seriousness of corruption (textual), and sex, educational level, socioeconomic level, political party affiliation (categorical). The primary results suggested that the meanings and definitions of corruption frequently feature the following verbs: to benefit, power, to obtain, to take advantage of, to steal, to bribe, and to threaten. Participants also mentioned acts of corruption that they learned about via mass media, and that involved the participation of government agents and large amounts of money. A third result was evidence that sociodemographic characteristics such as sex and education level are closely related with perceptions of what is and is not corrupt. Likewise, identification with a political party influences the judgments made on acts of corruption by both the opposing group and the group to which participants belong. We first discuss the gender difference in terms of the facts and meanings of corruption, and then we discuss how the facts of corruption (big and small) are perceived as serious or not depending on the education level of the citizens. Finally, we discuss how the attitudes and judgements expressed regarding an illegal act are considered more or less corrupt depending on the social or political group with which the citizens identify.

Schools and campuses-which used to be spaces for social exchange-had to cease face-toface instruction and shift to remote learning with no prior planning or training, which posed several challenges to education systems around the globe. In Latin America-responsible, today, for over half of the planet's daily COVID-19-related deaths-this scenario is even more dramatic. The diverse socioeconomic levels of the student population is a major challenge for online teaching, as institutions cannot provide computer training, equipment and connectivity to all those in need.

An assessment of the reliability, comprehensiveness, and quality of information uploaded to SoMe for Spanish-speaking patients with SLE is lacking. Methods This analytical observational study evaluates the videos uploaded to YouTube (R) in Spanish about SLE. Information about video length, engagement (i.e., views and likes), time on the internet, popularity index, and source was retrieved, and an evaluation on reliability, comprehensiveness, and quality was performed using standardized scores. Results One hundred eighty-six videos were included in the analysis. Most videos were considered as useful (87%) or useful patient opinion (8.1%), whereas only 2.2% were considered misleading and 2.7% as misleading patient opinion. The number of views (Median 7207 vs 113,877, p = .012), popularity index (Median 13.8 vs 168.7, p < .001), number of likes (Median 155 vs 3400, p < .001), and number of dislikes (Median 3 vs 138, p = .004) were higher for misleading videos. The videos uploaded by independent users had a higher engagement than those from government or news agencies, professional organizations or academic channels. Misleading videos and those uploaded by independent users had lower rates of reliability, comprehensiveness and quality (p < .001). Conclusions Most of the information shown in YouTube (R) videos on SLE tends to be useful. However, audience engagement parameters are larger for misleading videos.

In light of this trend, the concept of Circular Economy (CE) is gaining relevance since CE enables a set of strategies to avoid and reduce resource consumption, energy, and emissions derived from transforming raw material into functional products. These strategies also imply extending product lifespan, keeping their value as long as possible, and closing the loop of materials involved in such products. Future engineers will face the CE model, which involves a radical shift from the current linear model based on throw-away practices. Therefore, there is a need to educate professionals with knowledge in the topic and advance the research in the field. However, CE has not been yet globally introduced in the engineering curriculum in many parts of the world, and the research in the field has also been limited. CE has not been widely adopted yet as a strategy for the sustainable development of new products. Consequently, this article reviews and summarizes the research work and some implementation initiatives on CE in learning activities for engineering students during the last 10 years following a systematic approach. Results of the study provide a broad viewpoint in terms of where the research work is taking place and the means of disseminating the results. Additionally, an analysis based on the content reflects the methodological approaches used to introduce CE in the curriculum. Finally, the literature review also identifies the focus areas of the CE research and the emphasis during the life cycle of the products. This work also reflects on some challenges for implementing CE in the engineering curriculum. The analysis presented in this article serves as a keystone for educators, lecturers, and researchers in engineering education to include and implement CE strategies and methodological tools in the curriculum of engineering and advance the research work in this area.",Conference Paper,"Mesa, Jaime A.; Esparragoza, Ivan",Circular Economy;Curriculum;Education;Learning;Sustainability,Circular Economy;Curriculum;Education;Learning;Sustainability,Colombia,

We concentrate on educational outcomes addressing contradictory results in previous contributions. We use a randomized controlled trial implemented in 1993 that randomly assigned children to either TC or KMC. OLS results suggest that KMC children spent more time in preschool, had fewer temporary school absences, and showed lower math test scores. Both groups observed similar effects on high-school graduation and language test scores. We correct for attrition, small sample, and multiple outcomes.

The characterization and classification of the lesion is essential for proper surgical planning, with anteroposterior (AP), lateral and traction radiograph of the hip, paramount for decision-making. Patients and methods: This is a retrospective concordance study of 64 patients with hip fracture who consulted the hospital between January and July 2017. Four radiographs were taken of each: AP, AP with traction, lateral and lateral with traction. This set of images was evaluated by 9 observers, with different levels of experience, to answer questions regarding the classification, emphasize in potential instability and requirement of other images. A statistical analysis of concordance between and within observers was performed using Cohen's kappa coefficient. Results: Of the 64 patients, 70.6% were women; the average age was 69.5 years. 82.8% presented a secondary fracture from falling from their own height. As the observer's experience increases, the need for traction radiograph decreases; interobserver kappa goes from 0.98 in experts to 0.01 in students. Traction radiograph is important in the diagnosis of potentially unstable fractures. Of the 1,503 radiographs with traction, 636 (42.38%) were classified as potentially unstable. And of the 708 without traction, 560 (79.1%) were classified as potentially unstable. Conclusions: Traction hip radiograph continues to be a useful tool in training environments to adequately classify an intertrochanteric fracture, considering it is a low-cost, minimal morbidity intervention, and is easily accessible. In similar studies, we found similar findings regarding the usefulness of traction to perform an adequate classification in people in training or in young orthopedists. It also influences to determine the potential instability, and this would modify the choice of the implant 0 2020 Elsevier Ltd.

An input for its learning,"Assessing creativity in industrial design tends to focus on artifactual outcomes rather than the cognitive skills that support it, reducing the evaluative approach to an instrumental dimension. This can happen because cognition is a discrete process, which occurs in the subject's mind without being directly observable, unlike the final artifactual result. Hence the question of how to evaluate creative cognition skills in design teaching-learning processes framed in evaluation for learning. In order to respond, an assessment model was formulated to favor the teaching of creative cognition skills in project processes in industrial design, not only from a psychometric approach, but as an input to manage the teaching-learning processes. The model measured four variables characteristic of divergent thinking: fluidity, flexibility, originality and elaboration in the two phases of the design project process: problematization and ideation. This exercise made some creative cognitive skills visible by designing measurement instruments and interpreting the variables, allowing students and teachers to know their level of development, raising awareness of these skills applied to the industrial design project.",Article,"Pulido, R.C.; Mihajlovic, E.H.",design; creativity; cognition; assessment; education,design;creativity;cognition;assessment;education,Colombia,

Findings from previous studies, however, have been inconsistent, and the nature of the associations is unclear. Methods: We conducted Mendelian randomization analyses to evaluate the association of breast cancer risk, using genetic instruments, with fasting insulin, fasting glucose, 2-h glucose, body mass index (BMI) and BMI-adjusted waist-hip-ratio (WHRadj BMI). We first confirmed the association of these instruments with type 2 diabetes risk in a large diabetes genome-wide association study consortium. We then investigated their associations with breast cancer risk using individual-level data obtained from 98 842 cases and 83 464 controls of European descent in the Breast Cancer Association Consortium. Results: All sets of instruments were associated with risk of type 2 diabetes. Associations with breast cancer risk were found for genetically predicted fasting insulin [odds ratio (OR) = 1.71 per standard deviation (SD) increase, 95% confidence interval (CI) = 1.26-2.31, p = 5.09 x 10(-4)], 2-h glucose (OR = 1.80 per SD increase, 95% CI = 1.3 0-2.49, p = 4.02 x 10(-4)), BMI (OR = 0.70 per 5-unit increase, 95% CI = 0.65-0.76, p = 5.05 x 10(-19)) and WHRadj BMI (OR = 0.85, 95% CI = 0.79-0.91, p = 9.22 x 10(-6)). Stratified analyses showed that genetically predicted fasting insulin was more closely related to risk of estrogen-receptor [ER]-positive cancer, whereas the associations with instruments of 2h glucose, BMI and WHRadj BMI were consistent regardless of age, menopausal status, estrogen receptor status and family history of breast cancer. Conclusions: We confirmed the previously reported inverse association of genetically predicted BMI with breast cancer risk, and showed a positive association of genetically predicted fasting insulin and 2-h glucose and an inverse association of WHRadj BMI with breast cancer risk.

Interventions at the household level require the diagnosis of nutritional status among family members. The aim of this study was to describe the prevalence and patterns of various anthropometric typologies over a decade in Colombia using a novel approach that considers all children in the household as well as the mother. This approach also allows identifying a dual burden of malnutrition within a household, where one child may be overweight and another one undernourished. Methods: This study used data from the Demographic and Health Survey and the Colombian National Nutrition Survey [2000 n = 2,876, 2005 n = 8,598, and 2010 n = 11,349].Four mutually exclusive household (HH) anthropometric typologies -normal, undernourished, overweight/obese,anddual burden- were created. Anthropometric information of height-for-age Z-scores (HAZ) and body-mass-index-for-age Z-scores (BMIz) in children under the age of 5 y, and on body mass index (BMI) in mothers, 18-49 y was used. Results: Prevalence of overweight/obese HHs increased between 2000 (38.2%) and 2010 (43.1%) (p < 0.05), while undernourished and dual burden HHs significantly decreased between 2005 (13.7% and 10.6%, respectively) and 2010 (3.5% and 5.1%, respectively) (p < 0.05). A greater increase of overweight/obesity was observed for the lowest quintile of wealth index (WI), with an increase of almost 10% between 2000 and 2010, compared to 2% and 4% for the fourth and highest WI, respectively. Although in 2010 there is still a higher prevalence of overweight/obesity HHs in urban areas (43.7%), the prevalence of overweight/obesity HHs in rural areas increased sharply between 2000 (34.3%) and 2010 (41.6%) (p < 0.05).Conclusion: The observed prevalence of dual burden households was not different from the expected prevalence. Results from this study indicate that although overweight/obesity continues to be more prevalent among high-income Colombian households, it is growing at a faster pace among the most economically disadvantaged.",Article,"Unknown.; Unknown.; Gomez, Luis F.; Unknown.; Haire-Joshu, Debra.; Sarmiento, Olga L.; Unknown.; Unknown",Colombia;Dual burden;Malnutrition;Nutrition transition;Obesity;Overweight;Stunting,Colombia;Dual burden;Malnutrition;Nutrition transition;Obesity;Overweight;Stunting,United States;Colombia;Colombia;United States;United States;United States;United States,

In the brain, the inflammatory response is mediated by activated microglial cells, which undergo morphological and biochemical changes and can directly affect cell viability. Recent evidence shows that the use of estrogenic compounds can control microglia-induced inflammation with promising results. In this study, we explored the actions of the synthetic steroid tibolone on BV-2 microglia cells stimulated with palmitic acid. Our results demonstrated that tibolone increased cell viability and reduced nuclear fragmentation and the production of reactive oxygen species, as well as preserved mitochondrial membrane potential. These effects were accompanied by reduced nuclear translocation of NF-kappa B p65, upregulation of neuroglobin, and improved antioxidant defense. Furthermore, estrogen receptor beta (ER beta) inhibition partially dampened tibolone's protective actions in BV-2 cells stimulated with palmitic acid. In conclusion, tibolone protects BV-2 cells by a mechanism involving ER beta and upregulation of neuroglobin.",Article,"Hidalgo-Lanussa, O.; Avila-Rodriguez, M.; Baez-Jurado, E.; Zamudio, J.; Echeverria, V.; Garcia-Segura, L.M.; Barreto, G.E.",Palmitic acid; Obesity; Neurodegenerative diseases; Microglia; Neuroglobin; Estrogen receptors; Tibolone; Neuroinflammation,Palmitic acid;Obesity;Neurodegenerative diseases;Microglia;Neuroglobin;Estrogen receptors;Tibolone;Neuroinflammation;PI3K/AKT SIGNALING PATHWAY;SATURATED FATTY-ACIDS;NF-KAPPA-B;NEUROGLOBIN EXPRESSION;GLUCOSE DEPRIVATION;DIABETES-MELLITUS;ASTROCYTIC CELLS;BV-2 MICROGLIA;UP-REGULATION;17-BETA-ESTRADIOL,Colombia;United States;Chile;Spain,2-s2.0-85029808332

ER stress constitutes a cellular process characterized by accumulation of misfolded proteins, impaired lipid metabolism and induction of inflammatory responses. ER stress has been suggested to be involved in several human pathologies, including neurodegenerative diseases and obesity. Different studies have shown that both neurodegenerative diseases and obesity trigger similar cellular responses to ER stress. Moreover, both diseases are assessed in astrocytes as evidences suggest these cells as key regulators of brain homeostasis. However, the exact contributions to the effects of ER stress in astrocytes in the various neurodegenerative diseases and its relation with obesity are not well known. Here, we discuss recent advances in the understanding of molecular mechanisms that regulate ER stress-related disorders in astrocytes such as obesity and neurodegeneration. Moreover, we outline the correlation between the activated proteins of the unfolded protein response (UPR) in these pathological conditions in order to identify possible therapeutic targets for ER stress in astrocytes. We show that ER stress in astrocytes, shares UPR activation pathways during both obesity and neurodegenerative diseases, demonstrating that UPR related proteins like ER chaperone GRP 78/Bip, PERK pathway and other exogenous molecules ameliorate UPR response and promote neuroprotection.

Thus, the involvement of the most abundant and heterogeneous group of glial cells in neurodegenerative diseases, the astrocytes, is caused by a combination of the failure on their normal homeostatic functions and the increase of toxic metabolites upon pathological event. Upon brain damage, molecular signals induce astrocyte activation and migration to the site of injury, entering in a highly active state, with the aim to contribute to ameliorating or worsening the pathology.

Several randomized control studies that found success in preventing the progression to T2D in high-risk populations have identified early and intensive intervention based on an individualized prevention model as the key factor for participant benefit. The global prevalence of both overweight and obesity has now been widely recognized as the major epidemic of the 21st century. Obesity is a major risk factor for the progression from normal glucose tolerance to prediabetes and then to T2D. However, not all obese individuals will develop prediabetes or progress to diabetes. Intensive, multicomponent behavioural interventions for overweight and obese adults can lead to weight loss. Diabetes medications, including metformin, GLP-1 agonists, glitazones, and acarbose, can be considered for selected high-risk patients with prediabetes when lifestyle-based programmes are proven unsuccessful. Nutrition education is the cornerstone of a healthy lifestyle. Also, physical activity is an integral part of the prediabetes management plan and one of the main pillars in the prevention of diabetes. Mobile phones, used extensively worldwide, can facilitate communication between health professionals and the general population, and have been shown to be helpful in the prevention of T2D.

Obesity is frequently associated with risk factors for cardiovascular and metabolic diseases. Central obesity is a marker of increased intra-abdominal adiposity and a known risk factor for atherosclerosis and diabetes; it is also a good predictor of risk for coronary events, cardiovascular mortality, diabetes and metabolic syndrome. A less predictive alternate measurement is known as the body mass index (BMI). Objective. Obesity prevalence was estimated first by BMI and then by abdominal obesity (measured by waist circumference, WC) in primary care patients. Materials and methods. As part of an international study, primary care physicians recruited consecutive patients aged 18 to 80 years who consulted for any reason on two pre-specified half-days. Age, gender, smoking status and history of cardiovascular disease or diabetes were recorded. Height, weight and WC were measured using standard methods. Pregnant women and subjects unwilling to participate were excluded. Results. A total of 3,795 patients from 105 primary care centers located throughout Colombia were evaluated. The mean age was 45 years (69% females). Of these, 60.7% of males and 53.9% of females were overweight or obese according to their BMI; 24.6% of males and 44.6% of females had abdominal obesity when National Cholesterol Education Program guidelines were used, but numbers changed to 62.5% and 67.0% when the International Diabetes Federation guidelines were used. Obesity, either determined by BMI or by WC, was associated with higher prevalence of diabetes, hypertension and dyslipidemia. Conclusions.

This study examined associations between time spent traveling in motor vehicles per week (TSTMV) and BMI and abdominal obesity (AO) among Colombian adults residing in urban areas who do not own car. Method. Secondary data analysis of the 2005 National Nutrition Survey of Colombia was conducted. TSTMV was assessed using the long International Physical Activity Questionnaire. Body composition was measured in 7900 adults. Polytomous and binary logistic regressions were conducted, stratified by gender and adjusted for confounders, including physical activity (PA). Results. Forty-two percent of participants were either overweight or obese according to their BM!, and 22.4% had AO. Males in the middle (10 to 149 min) and highest (>150 min) TSTMV tertiles were more likely to be overweight (POR = 1.58, 95% CI = 1.13-2.21 and POR = 1.55, 95% CI = 1.12-2.15 respectively, p-trend = 0.012), obese (POR = 2.39, 95% CI = 1.43-3.99 and POR = 1.93, 95% CI = 1.22-3.08 respectively, p trend = 0.019) and to have AO (POR = 1.81, 95% CI = 1.18-2.78 and POR = 1.73, 95% CI = 1.18-2.54 respectively, p-trend = 0.009). Associations were not significant in females. Conclusions. TSTMV was positively associated with overweight and AO in adult Colombian males even after adjusting for PA. These findings highlight the potential deleterious health effects of sedentary behaviors such as prolonged traveling time, independently of having met PA recommendations. (C) 2012 Elsevier Inc.

To explore the physiological importance of Nisch, here we generated Nisch loss-of-function mutant mice and analyzed their metabolic phenotype. Nisch-mutant embryos exhibited delayed development, characterized by small size and attenuated weight gain. We uncovered the reason for this phenotype by showing that Nisch binds to and inhibits the activity of AMP-activated protein kinase (AMPK), which regulates energy homeostasis by suppressing anabolic and activating catabolic processes. The Nisch mutations enhanced AMPK activation and inhibited mechanistic target of rapamycin signaling in mouse embryonic fibroblasts as well as in muscle and liver tissues of mutant mice. Nisch-mutant mice also exhibited increased rates of glucose oxidation with increased energy expenditure, despite reduced overall food intake. Moreover, the Nisch-mutant mice had reduced expression of liver markers of gluconeogenesis associated with increased glucose tolerance. As a result, these mice displayed decreased growth and body weight.

Design: We calculated age-and sex-specific Z-scores for BMI, ASF, waist circumference, waist-to-height ratio and three other skinfold-thickness sites. Logistic regression with stepwise selection (P=0.80 for entry and P=0.05 for retention) was performed to identify predictors of IR and extreme IR, which were determined by age-and sex-specific Z-scores to identify the >= 90th and >= 95th percentile of homeostasis model assessment (HOMA(IR)), respectively. We used receiver operating characteristic curves to compare the area under the curve between models. Setting: Bucaramanga, Colombia. Subjects: Children (n 1261) aged 6-10 years in Tanner stage 1 from a population-based study. Results: A total of 127 children (seventy girls and fifty-seven boys) were classified with IR, including sixty-three children (thirty-three girls and thirty boys) classified with extreme IR. Only ASF and BMI Z-scores were retained as predictors of IR by stepwise selection. Adding ASF Z-score to BMI Z-score improved the area under the curve from 0.794 (95% CI 0.752, 0.837) to 0.811 (95% CI 0.770, 0.851; P for contrast=0.01). In predicting extreme IR, the addition of ASF Z-score to BMI Z-score improved the area under the curve from 0.837 (95% CI 0.790, 0.884) to 0.864 (95% CI 0.823, 0.905; P for contrast=0.01).

It is considered a multicausal disease, and one of the determining factors is nutritional imbalances, which include high-fat diets. In this paper, we use the zebrafish model to assess the impact of overfeeding and a high-fat diet in somatic and cardiac parameters in young and adult zebrafish. The results show that fish receiving a high-fat diet showed greater weight gain compared to fish receiving a standard fat diet. Additionally, changes in the heart, including increases in size, a change in the triangular shape of the ventricle to a globular shape, and an increase in the thickness of the trabeculae of the spongy myocardium were observed. These changes could be indicators of cardiovascular overload. The results show that there is a direct relationship between the intake of a high-fat diet and obesity, which in turn can induce cardiac changes, supporting the hypothesis of the relationship between high-fat diets and cardiovascular risk factors. Given the genetic similarity between zebrafish and humans, these results could be extrapolated to human beings, and the findings similarly highlight the importance of incorporating a balanced diet from the early life stages to reduce the risk of cardiovascular disease.",Article,"Vargas, R.; Vasquez, I.C.",Nutrition; Body mass index; Obesity; Myocardium; Cardiovascular risk,Nutrition;Body mass index;Obesity;Myocardium;Cardiovascular risk;METABOLIC SYNDROME;BIRTH-WEIGHT;CHILDHOOD;INSULIN;HEALTH;ADIPOKINES;CHILDREN;IMPACT;GROWTH,Colombia,2-s2.0-85028325305

Evidence suggests that sugar sweetened beverages (SSB) are associated to overweight/obesity, and that taxes on these beverages could reduce their associated health consequences. This paper assesses the potential effect of different levels of a SSB tax in Colombia on overweight and obesity prevalence. Using peer-reviewed local data on own-price elasticity of SSB, we applied a comparative risk assessment strategy to simulate the effect of the SSB tax on a nationally representative nutritional survey with 7140 adults in 2010 (ENSIN, 2010). Our results varied depending on the tax scenario, pass-through assumption and household socio economic strata (SES). We found that among individuals belonging to lower SES households, the SSB tax would reduce overweight and obesity between 1.5-4.9 and 1.1-2.4 percentage points (p < 0.05), respectively. Among individuals belonging to higher SES households, we found no statistically significant effects on obesity, and a reduction on overweight prevalence between 2.9 and 3.9 percentage points (p < 0.05). In the most conservative scenario (40% pass-through), a tax rate of at least 75 cents of Colombian peso (0.75 COP) per milliliter (24% of the average price) is needed to have statistically significant effects on both overweight and obesity prevalence among lower SES households. The results of this study suggest that a SSB tax could reduce the overweight and obesity prevalence in Colombia, especially among lower SES households. This study shows that SSB taxes have a particularly beneficial effect in the most vulnerable population. Additional social and individual benefits, or individual costs arising from the tax are not assessed in this research, implying that even larger health gains could be observed.",Article,"Vecino-Ortiz, A.I.; Arroyo-Ariza, D.",Colombia; Taxes; Sugar sweetened beverages; Overweight; Obesity,Colombia;Taxes;Sugar sweetened beverages;Overweight;Obesity;PASS-THROUGH;PRICES;HEALTH;METAANALYSIS;CONSUMPTION;BEHAVIOR;WELFARE;POLICY;RISK;FOOD,Colombia;United States,2-s2.0-85047630567

Increased impulsivity has been described across all stages and phases of BD as being also associated with a worse prognosis. Although obesity and impulsivity are common features among rapid cycling bipolar disorder (RC-BD) patients, there is a lack of understanding about the clinical implications of these conditions combined in BD. Methods: To explore and integrate available evidence on shared clinical associations between obesity and impulsivity in RC-BD a systematic search of the literature in the electronic database of the National Library of Medicine (PubMed) has been conducted. Results: One hundred and fourteen articles were included in our systematic review. Among RC-BD patients, substance abuse disorders (SUDs), anxiety disorders (ADs), predominantly depressive polarity, chronic exposure to antidepressants, psychotic symptoms, suicidality, and comorbid medical conditions are strongly associated with both obesity and impulsivity. Limitations: Heterogeneity of published data, inconsistent measurements of both obesity and impulsivity in RC-BD and an absence of control for RC-BD in epidemiological surveys. Consequently, their combined impact on the severity of RC-BD is yet to be recognized and remains to be poorly understood. Conclusion: In RC-BD patients the co-occurrence of obesity and impulsivity is associated with an unfavorable course of illness, specific shared clinical correlates, negative psychosocial impact, and overall worse prognosis. There is a need to examine obesity and impulsivity as modulating factors and markers of severity in RC-BD. (C) 2014 Elsevier B.V.

Minimum sample size was calculated at 366 patients. A total of 501 patients were admitted in the study. Visceral fat measurement using bioimpedance was defined as high over the 9% mark; from there the cut-off points of the waist circumference for men and women were estimated with a ROC curve. A cut-off point of 89 cm was estimated for women, with a sensitivity of 82.35% and specificity of 78.77% and area under the curve 0.89 (CI: 95%, 0.85-0.92).

As a result of this study, the definition of abdominal obesity is proposed as the cut-off point of the waist circumference greater than or equal to 91 cm for men and greater than or equal to 89 cm for women.

Preventive or therapeutic interventions are difficult to implement and maintain over time. On the other hand, the majority of adolescents in the United States have a smartphone, representing a huge potential for innovative digitized interventions, such as weight loss programs delivered via smartphone applications. Although the number of available smartphone applications is increasing, evidence for their effectiveness in weight loss is insufficient. Therefore, the proposed study aims to assess the efficacy of a gamification-based smartphone application for weight loss in overweight and obese adolescents. The trial is designed to be a phase II, single-centre, two-arm, triple-blinded, randomized controlled trial (RCT) with a duration of 6 months. Method: The intervention consists of a smartphone application that provides both tracking and gamification elements, while the control arm consists of an identically designed application solely with tracking features of health information. The proposed trial will be conducted in an urban primary care clinic of an academic centre in the United States of America, with expertise in the management of overweight and obese adolescents. Eligible adolescents will be followed for 6 months. Changes in body mass index z score from baseline to 6 months will be the primary outcome. Secondary objectives will explore the effects of the gamification-based application on adherence, as well as anthropometric, metabolic and behavioural changes. A required sample size of 108 participants (54 participants per group) was calculated. Discussion: The benefits of the proposed study include mid-term effects in weight reduction for overweight and obese adolescents.

In Colombia, the distribution of sleep disorders remains unclear. We aimed to describe the distribution of sleep disorders, according to demographic, geographic and anthropometric characteristics, in adult Colombian populations. Methods: A multicenter study was conducted with 5474 participants recruited from three Colombian cities at different altitudes. A two-stage cluster sampling method was applied. Participants' mean age was 40.2 years and 53.8% were female. Collected data included demographic information and anthropometric characteristics of adiposity such as body mass index, neck circumference and waist circumference, as well as participants' scores on five scales used to assess sleep disorders. Disorders included sleepiness, obstructive sleep apnea (OSA), insomnia, poor sleep quality and restless legs syndrome; the scales were the Epworth Sleepiness Scale, Berlin questionnaire, STOP -Bang questionnaire, Pittsburgh Sleep Quality Index and diagnostic criteria for the restless legs syndrome set out by the International Restless Legs Syndrome Study Group. Results: Nearly two-thirds of the population reported at least one sleep disorder according to their results on the five scales (59.6% [95%CI 57.4; 61.81)]. This proportion was similar by sex. Prevalence of overweight was 34.8% and of obesity was 14.4%. Sleep disorders were more frequent among those aged 65 years or more (91.11 [95%CI 86.1; 94.43]), those who were obese (83.71% [95%Cl 78.94; 87.56]) and those who resided in the cities at the lowest altitude (72.4% [95%CI 70.2; 74.5]). Waist circumference showed a stronger association with sleep disorders among women than among men. Conclusions: Sleep disorders are common in Colombia, irrespective of sex and geographical location. They are associated with obesity. Abdominal obesity could explain the high frequency of sleep disorders among women. We believe that this part of the study will substantially contribute to the understanding of sleep disorders. Further research is needed to identify key factors behind the high prevalence rates of sleep disorders and obesity in Colombia. (C) 2016 The Authors.

Therefore, we characterized anthropometry, dietary intake, PA and sitting time (ST) in adolescents aged 15-17 years from eight Latin American countries. Methods: Six hundred seventy-one adolescents (41.4% girls) from the Latin American Study of Nutrition and Health (ELANS) were included. Nutritional status was classified by four BMI (kg/m(2)) categories. Waist circumference (WC) was categorized as above or below thresholds. Dietary intake was assessed through two non-consecutive 24-h dietary recalls. PA and ST were measured using the International Physical Activity Questionnaire (IPAQ). We calculated overall and country-specific estimates by sex and tested for differences between boys and girls. Results: Differences in the prevalence of overweightness (15.1 and 21.6%) and obesity (8.5 and 6.5%) between boys and girls, respectively, were statistically insignificant (p = 0.059). Average energy intake was 2289.7 kcal/day (95% CI: 2231-2350) for boys and 1904.2 kcal/day (95% CI: 1840-1963) for girls (p < 0.001). In relation to macronutrient intake for boys and girls, respectively, the average intake (expressed as percentage of total energy) was 15.0 and 14.9% for protein; 55.4 and 54.9% for carbohydrates; 14.1 and 14.5% for added sugar; 29.5 and 30.1% for total fat; and 9.6 and 9.9% for saturated fat (p > 0.05 for all outcomes). There was no statistically significant difference in the prevalence of total energy (TE) saturated fat and added sugar (>10% of TE) between girls and boys (49.6% versus 44.8 and 81.7% versus 76.1%, respectively). Prevalence of physical inactivity was 19% in boys and 43.7% in girls (p < 0.001). Median levels of vigorous-intensity PA and total PA were significantly higher for boys than for girls (p < 0.05 for both outcomes); whereas levels of ST were similar (273.7 versus 220.0 min/day for boys and girls, respectively; p > 0.05).

Maternal hyperglycaemia and hyperinsulinemia play an important role in the aetiology of GDM. A combination of these and other factors predisposes women to developing GDM with pre-pregnancy normal weight, viz. classic GDM. However, women with GDM and prepregnancy obesity (gestational diabesity, GDty) or overweight (GDMow) show a different metabolic status than women with classic GDM. GDty and GDMow are associated with altered l-arginine/nitric oxide and insulin/adenosine axis signalling in the human foetoplacental microvascular and macrovascular endothelium. These alterations differ from those observed in classic GDM. Here, we have reviewed the consequences of GDty and GDMow in the modulation of foetoplacental endothelial cell function, highlighting studies describing the modulation of intracellular pH homeostasis and the potential implications of NO generation and adenosine signalling in GDty-associated foetal vascular insulin resistance. Moreover, with an increase in the rate of obesity in women of childbearing age worldwide, the prevalence of GDty is expected to increase in the next decades. Therefore, we emphasize that women with GDty and GDMow should be characterized with a different metabolic state from that of women with classic GDM to develop a more specific therapeutic approach for protecting the mother and foetus.",Review,"Cornejo, M.; Fuentes, G.; Valero, P.; Vega, S.; Grismaldo, A.; Toledo, F.; Pardo, F.; Moore-Carrasco, R.; Subiabre, M.; Casanello, P.; Faas, M.M.; van Goor, H.; Sobrevia, L.",adenosine; diabesity; diabetes; intracellular pH; obesity; placenta,adenosine;diabesity;diabetes;intracellular pH;obesity;placenta;NITRIC-OXIDE SYNTHASE;L-ARGININE TRANSPORT;NA+/H+ EXCHANGER ACTIVITY;INSULIN-RECEPTOR ISOFORM;AMINO-ACID-TRANSPORT;GROWTH-FACTOR-II;ADENOSINE TRANSPORT;ENDOTHELIAL-CELLS;PREGNANT-WOMEN;HIGH-AFFINITY,Chile;Netherlands;Brazil;Colombia;Spain;Australia,2-s2.0-85105639718

Objective: This review discusses the relationships between sleep, obesity, and breathing disorders with concomitant risks of developing cancer. Results: Sleep disorders result in abnormal expression of clock genes, decreased immunity, and melatonin release disruption. Therefore, these disorders may contribute to cancer development. Moreover, in sleep breathing disorder, which is frequently experienced by obese persons, the sufferer experiences intermittent hypoxia that may stimulate cancer cell proliferation. Discussion: During short- or long-duration sleep, sleep -wake rhythm disruption may occur. Insomnia and obstructive sleep apnea increase cancer risks. In short sleepers, an increased risk of stomach cancer, esophageal squamous cell cancer, and breast cancer was observed. Among long sleepers (>9 hours), the risk of some hematologic malignancies is elevated.

The economic impact of obesity was calculated by multiplying the cost of care per patient for each comorbidity by the number of cases attributable exclusively to obesity. Results: A total of 997 371 DALYs were estimated, 45% of which corresponded to men; 81% of DALYs corresponded to years lived with disability. Conditions with greater attributable DALYs are, in order, hypertension (31.6% of the total DALYs), type 2 diabetes mellitus (28.0%), cardiac ischemic disease (14.6%), and lower back pain (11.2%). An estimation of 20.5 DALYs per 1000 inhabitants was made. The economic impact of care for comorbidities associated with obesity could amount to $2158 million.

Bariatric surgery has shown to be more effective in reducing weight than the traditional pharmacologic and nonpharmacologic treatments. Objective: To evaluate the cost-effectiveness of this alternative compared with standard treatment in the Colombian context. Methods: A Markov single cohort model was used to simulate the incremental cost per quality-adjusted life-year (QALY) gained every year over a base-case 5-year time horizon. The model considers 5 health states: comorbidity, remission, acute myocardial infarction, stroke, and death. Four comorbidity conditions were evaluated separately: diabetes, hypertension, dyslipidemia, and sleep apnea. The model was evaluated from a third-payer perspective. All costs were expressed in 2016 Colombian pesos ($1.00 = 3051 COP). A 5% annual discount rate was applied to both costs and outcomes. Results: In baseline analysis, bariatric surgery was a cost-effective alternative compared with nonsurgical treatment in the diabetes and hypertension cohort with an incremental cost-effectiveness ratio of $6 194 899 and $43 689 527 per QALY gained, respectively. In the sleep apnea cohort, surgery has greater effectiveness and lower costs, which is why it is a dominant strategy. In the dyslipidemia cohort, bariatric surgery is dominated by the nonsurgical approach. Conclusion: The current study provides evidence that bariatric surgery is a cost-effective alternative among some cohorts in the Colombian setting. For obese patients with sleep apnea or diabetes, bariatric surgery is a recommendable alternative (dominant and cost-effective, respectively) for the Colombian healthcare system.",Article,"Gil-Rojas, Y.; Garzon, A.; Lasalvia, P.; Hernandez, F.; Castaneda-Cardona, C.; Rosselli, D.",cost-effectiveness; cost-utility; bariatric surgery; obesity; pharmacologic treatment,cost-effectiveness;cost-utility;bariatric surgery;obesity;pharmacologic treatment,Colombia,2-s2.0-85065424359

The aim of this study was to establish the association of maternal, family, and contextual correlates of anthropometric typologies at the household level in Colombia using 2005 Demographic Health Survey (DHS/ENDS) data. Methods. Household-level information from mothers 18-49 years old and their children <5 years old was included. Stunting and overweight were assessed for each child. Mothers were classified according to their body mass index. Four anthropometric typologies at the household level were constructed: normal, underweight, overweight, and dual burden. Four three-level [households (n = 8598) nested within municipalities (n = 226), nested within states (n = 32)] hierarchical polytomous logistic models were developed. Household log-odds of belonging to one of the four anthropometric categories, holding 'normal' as the reference group, were obtained. Results. This study found that anthropometric typologies were associated with maternal and family characteristics of maternal age, parity, maternal education, and wealth index. Higher municipal living conditions index was associated with a lower likelihood of underweight typology and a higher likelihood of overweight typology. Higher population density was associated with a lower likelihood of overweight typology. Conclusion.

This pathological phenomenon induces deleterious metabolic changes in cells and is associated with neurodegenerative diseases, dyslipidemia, and obesity. Recent evidence has demonstrated that tibolone, a synthetic steroid, protects cellular damage through various mechanisms; but its underlying actions upon lipotoxic damage are unknown. In this study, we assessed the effects of tibolone administration on normal human astrocytes subject to supraphysiological levels of palmitic acid as a model to induce cytotoxicity. Our results demonstrated that tibolone attenuated lipotoxic damage of PA in normal human astrocytes by reducing PI uptake in 53%, prevented cardiolipin loss by 17%, reduced fragmented/condensed nuclei by 50.81% and attenuated the production of superoxide ions by around 20%. In conclusion, these data suggest that protective effects of tibolone against lipotoxicity may be mediated, in part, through modulation of the different cellular mechanisms of astrocytes.",Article,"Martin-Jimenez, C.; Gonzalez, J.; Vesga, D.; Aristizabal, A.; Barreto, G.E.",Human astrocytes; Tibolone; Palmitic acid; Obesity; Neuroprotection,Human astrocytes;Tibolone;Palmitic acid;Obesity;Neuroprotection;FATTY-ACIDS;OXIDATIVE DAMAGE;PROGENITOR CELLS;UP-REGULATION;IN-VITRO;ESTROGEN;MITOCHONDRIA;EXPRESSION;PROTECTS,Colombia;Ireland,2-s2.0-85087625257

Additionally, hyperglycemia, independent of associated comorbidities, is related to the loss of muscle mass and strength, and contributes to functional impairment in older adults. We studied the mediation effect of glucose levels, in the relationship between abdominal obesity and relative handgrip strength (HGS). A total of 1571 participants (60.0% women, mean age 69.1 +/- 7.0 years) from 86 municipalities were selected following a multistage area probability sampling design. Measurements included demographic and anthropometric/adiposity markers (weight, height, body mass index, and waist circumference). HGS was measured using a digital dynamometer for three sets and the mean value was recorded. The values were normalized to body weight (relative HGS). Fasting glucose was analyzed by enzymatic colorimetric methods. Mediation analyses were performed to identify associations between the independent variable (abdominal obesity) and outcomes (relative HGS), as well as to determine whether fasting glucose levels mediated the relationship between excess adiposity and relative HGS. A total of 1239 (78.8%) had abdominal obesity. Abdominal obesity had a negative effect on fasting glucose (beta = 9.04, 95%CI = 5.87 to 12.21); while fasting glucose to relative HGS was inversely related (beta = -0.003, 95%CI = -0.005 to -0.001),p< 0.001. The direct effect of abdominal obesity on relative HGS was statistically significant (beta = -0.069, 95%CI = -0.082 to -0.057),p< 0.001. Lastly, fasting glucose levels mediates the detrimental effect of abdominal obesity on relative HGS (indirect effect beta = -0.002, 95%CI = -0.004 to -0.001),p< 0.001. Our results suggest that the glucose level could worsen the association between abdominal obesity status and lower HGS.

In this review we describe multiple lines of evidence indicating that altered secretion of androgens and adipokines, from dysfunctional adipose tissue, are independently linked with BC development. However, adipokines (adiponectin and leptin) participate in important biological processes in BC cells by modulating signaling pathways similar to those used by the androgen receptor. These similarities suggest that crosstalk between these factors can occur, with a high probability that its interactions may be responsible for modifying the behavior of normal and tumor cells, especially in obesity. The knowledge of how adiponectin and leptin can interact with the androgen receptor signaling may prospectively guide the development of therapeutic approaches aimed at potentiating the inhibitory actions of adiponectin and androgen receptor or interfering with the pro-stimulatory role of leptin in BC. Obesity is an increasing health challenge and is recognized as a breast cancer risk factor. Although obesity-related breast cancer mechanisms are not fully understood, this association has been linked to impaired hormone secretion by the dysfunctional obese adipose tissue (hyperplasic and hypertrophic adipocytes). Among these hormones, altered production of androgens and adipokines is observed, and both, are independently associated with breast cancer development. In this review, we describe and comment on the relationships reported between these factors and breast cancer, focusing on the biological associations that have helped to unveil the mechanisms by which signaling from androgens and adipokines modifies the behavior of mammary epithelial cells. Furthermore, we discuss the potential crosstalk between the two most abundant adipokines produced by the adipose tissue (adiponectin and leptin) and the androgen receptor, an emerging marker in breast cancer. The identification and understanding of interactions among adipokines and the androgen receptor in cancer cells are necessary to guide the development of new therapeutic approaches in order to prevent and cure obesity and breast cancer.",Review,"Rangel, N.; Villegas, V.E.; Rondon-Lagos, M.",obesity; breast cancer; androgens; androgen receptor; adipokines; adiponectin; leptin,obesity;breast cancer;androgens;androgen receptor;adipokines;adiponectin;leptin;BODY-MASS INDEX;CYCLIN D1 EXPRESSION;SEX STEROID-HORMONES;ESTROGEN-RECEPTOR;ADIPOSE-TISSUE;ER-ALPHA;GROWTH-FACTOR;TAMOXIFEN RESISTANCE;MOLECULAR SUBTYPES;PIK3CA MUTATIONS,Colombia,2-s2.0-85105121682

The aim of this study was to determine (i) the detrimental effect of excess adiposity on dependence in activities of daily living (ADL), and (ii) whether relative handgrip strength (HGS) moderates the adverse effect of excess adiposity on dependence, and to provide the threshold of relative HGS from which the adverse effect could be improved or worsened. A total of 4169 participants (69.3 +/- 7.0 years old) from 244 municipalities were selected following a multistage area probability sampling design. Measurements included anthropometric/adiposity markers (weight, height, body mass index, waist circumference, and waist-to-height ratio (WHtR)), HGS, sarcopenia ""proxy"" (calf circumference), and ADL (Barthel Index scale). Moderation analyses were performed to identify associations between the independent variable (WHtR) and outcomes (dependence), as well as to determine whether relative HGS moderates the relationship between excess adiposity and dependence. The present study demonstrated that (i) the adverse effect of having a higher WHtR level on dependence in ADL was moderated by relative HGS, and (ii) two moderation thresholds of relative HGS were estimated: 0.35, below which the adverse effect of WHtR levels on dependency is aggravated, and 0.62, above which the adverse effect of fat on dependency could be improved.

Poorly controlled diabetes (hemogloblin A1c [HbA1c] >= 7%) was found in 58.6, 73.0 and 78.3% of participants with diabetes duration of < 5, 5-12 and > 12 years, respectively (in association with a high prevalence of macro- and microvascular complications). Moreover, 37.7% of participants with diabetes duration of 5-12 years were treated only with oral antihyperglycemic drugs. The GOAL study investigated the efficacy of insulin in 2704 poorly controlled participants (mean HbA1c 9.7%; diabetes duration 10.1 +/- 6.7 years; 10 LMIC). A significant 2% reduction in mean HbA1c levels was observed after 12 months of treatment. Only 7.2% of participants experienced a symptomatic episode of hypoglycemia (nocturnal or severe hypoglycemia events were infrequent). Conclusion The rate of well-controlled participants (HbA1c < 7.0%) in the Wave 7 sub-analysis was lower than that observed in the USA (NHANES survey) or in European countries (GUIDANCE study), and the incidence of microvascular complications was higher. The GOAL study showed that insulin treatment improves glycemic control and reduces this gap. The Expert Panel recommends intensifying diabetes treatment as soon as possible, as well as patients' education and other preventive measures, initiatives which require modest costs compared to hospitalization and treatment of diabetes complications.",Article,"Aschner, P.; Galstyan, G.; Yavuz, D.G.; Litwak, L.; Gonzalez-Galvez, G.; Goldberg-Eliaschewitz, F.; Hafidh, K.; Djaballah, K.; Tu, S.T.; Unnikrishnan, A.G.; Khunti, K.",Diabetes complications; Diabetes mellitus; Glycemic control; Health policy; Health promotion; Health services development; Human resources; Low; and middle-income countries; Nutrition; Obesity,Diabetes complications;Diabetes mellitus;Glycemic control;Health policy;Health promotion;Health services development;Human resources;Low;and middle-income countries;Nutrition;Obesity;MANAGEMENT-PRACTICES;TYPE-2;BARRIERS;PEOPLE;COST;CARE;ACHIEVEMENT;IMPACT;DEATH,Colombia;Russian Federation;Turkey;Argentina;Mexico;Brazil;United Arab Emirates;France;Taiwan;India;United Kingdom,2-s2.0-85104132931

A variety of measures to assess eating habits and physical activity are available, being the self-report frequency questionnaires the most common and cost-efficient. Nevertheless, those questionnaires generate a large amount of data. Considering this, the purpose of the study was to develop a proposal to synthesize information from the Child Overweight/Obesity Healthy related Habits Questionnaire (CHS-SO), through the creation of indexes and a combination of a factorial method and cluster analysis. Nine indexes were created to assess eating habits, physical activity, and digital entertainment use, allowing to classify children into healthy or unhealthy in each index. The CHS-SO was administered to 239 children between 8 and 12 years old from Cali, Colombia. Data obtained from the indexes were analyzed using a multiple correspondence analysis and cluster analysis. Results show that most of the children have healthy eating habits, physical activity was lower in girls and digital entertainment use was high.",Article,"Arevalo, Maria Teresa Varela.; Unknown.; Cuevas, Jose Rafael Tovar",Consumption of digital entertainment;Eating habits;Obesity;Overweight;Physical activity,Consumption of digital entertainment;Eating habits;Obesity;Overweight;Physical activity,Colombia;Colombia,

Method: We used data from three upper middle-income settings (Colombia-SABE-Bogota, Mexico-SAGE, and South Africa-SAGE) and two high-income countries (England-ELSA and US-HRS) to estimate logistic regression models using age, gender, and education to predict health and health behaviors. Results: The sharpest gradients appear in middle-income settings but follow expected patterns found in high-income countries for poor self-reported health, functionality, cognitive impairment, and depression. However, weaker gradients appear for obesity, hypertension, diabetes, and other chronic conditions in Colombia and Mexico and the gradient reverses in South Africa. Strong disparities exist in risky health behaviors and in early nutritional status in the middle-income settings. Discussion: Rapid demographic and nutritional transitions, urbanization, poor early life conditions, social mobility, negative health behavior, and unique country circumstances provide a useful framework for understanding the SES health gradient in middle-income settings. In contrast with high-income countries, the increasing prevalence of obesity, an important risk factor for chronic conditions and other aspects of health, may ultimately change the SES gradient for diseases in the future.",Article,"McEniry, M.; Samper-Ternent, R.; Florez, C.E.; Pardo, R.; Cano-Gutierrez, C.",Diabetes; Health disparities; Hypertension; Middle-income countries; Obesity; Socioeconomic status,Diabetes;Health disparities;Hypertension;Middle-income countries;Obesity;Socioeconomic status;UNITED-STATES;SOCIOECONOMIC INEQUALITIES;EDUCATIONAL-ATTAINMENT;SOUTH-AFRICA;MORTALITY;PREVALENCE;NUTRITION;POPULATION,United States;Colombia,2-s2.0-85071704468

No study has focused on simultaneous evaluation of associations between iron stores and the above cardiometabolic diseases (CMD) in the same population. We aim to evaluate the association between serum ferritin and risk of T2D, CHD and CEVD in Scottish population over a wide range of ferritin levels. Methods Longitudinal study in 6,497 participants of the 1995 and 1998 Scottish health surveys, who were followed-up until 2011. Cox regression models were conducted adjusting for age, sex/menopausal status, fibrinogen, GGT levels, smoking, alcohol consumption, total cholesterol, HDL-cholesterol, blood pressure, and BMI. Ferritin was used as continuous (sex/menopausal status-specific Z score) and categorical variable (sex/menopausal status-specific quartiles, quintiles and sextiles). Results During follow-up, 4.9% of the participants developed T2D, 5.3% CHD, and 2.3% CEVD. By using ferritin quartiles, serum ferritin was positively associated with T2D, CHD and CEVD but only the association with T2D remained after adjustment for covariates [Quartile 4 v. 1: adjusted HR 95% CI 1.59 (1.10-2.34); P = 0.006]. When ferritin sextiles were used (6 v. 1), the ferritin-CEVD association became slightly stronger and significant [adjusted HR 95% CI 2.08 (1.09-3.94); P = 0.024].

There are relatively few studies that explore the effect of accelerometer-determined moderate-to-vigorous physical activity (MVPA) on neck circumference (NC), most of them confined to single high-income countries. The present study investigated the association of accelerometer-determined MVPA with NC in adolescents and adults from eight Latin American countries, which are mostly upper-middle income countries.MethodsThe sample consisted of 2370 participants (47.8% male) from the Latin American Study of Nutrition and Health, a multicenter cross-sectional nutrition and health surveillance study of a nationally representative sample from eight Latin American countries (Argentina, Brazil, Chile, Colombia, Costa Rica, Ecuador, Peru, and Venezuela). Times (min/day) in MVPA (defined as time accumulated at 1952 activity counts/min) was assessed by ActiGraph GT3X+ accelerometer over 7days. NC for adolescent was categorized as abnormal if circumference was >34.5cm for boys and>31.25 for girls, whereas for adults the cut-off points for abnormal were>39cm for men and>35cm women. Multilevel logistic models, including country and region as random effects and adjusted for sex, age, socioeconomic level, and educational level, were used to study the association between MVPA and NC.ResultsThe average time of MVPA was 34.88min/day, ranging from 31.16 in Venezuela to 40.27 in Chile. Concerning NC, 37.0% of the sample was classified as having elevated NC. Chile was the country with the highest percentage of people with elevated NC (56.9%), and Colombia had the lowest percentage (24.8%). Overall, the MVPA (min/day) was associated with elevated NC (OR=0.994, CI95%=0.990-0.998). In Costa Rica and Peru, there were significant associations between MVPA and NC when analyzed by country.ConclusionsThe present study provided evidence of significant associations between MVPA and NC in adolescents and adults from Latin America, independent of sex, age, socioeconomic level, and educational level. This analysis of accelerometry data and NC represents the first examination of these associations in eight Latin America countries. Further research is required to understand the differences between countries in the observed associations.Trial registrationClinicalTrials.Gov NCT02226627.

,,,2,WOS:000492707500009,2019,Gait speed moderates the adverse effect of obesity on dependency in older Colombian adult,"Introduction: Gait speed worsens with the presence of obesity, and is a powerful marker of functional dependence. Accordingly, gait speed could be a factor that improves or worsens the relationship between obesity and dependence in activities of daily living (ADL). However, to date this potential role has not been examined and the minimum gait speed threshold in the relationship between obesity and ADL is not known. The aim of this study was to determine whether speed moderates the association between obesity and dependence in ADL, and also define the gait speed threshold of this relationship. Methods: A total of 20,507 community-dwelling older adults from a cross-sectional analysis of national survey data - the Colombian Health, Well-being and Aging study (SABE, 2015) - were surveyed. The research data were collected using structured questionnaires, including basic information, ADL measured using the Barthel Index, body mass index, and gait speed (3 m). The Johnson-Neyman technique was applied to determine the gait speed threshold adjusted for age, sex and comorbidities. Results: Regression analysis showed a significant detrimental effect of obesity on dependence in ADL, which was moderated by gait speed (beta = 0.081; 95%CI: 0.045 to 0.117; p < 0.001). Adjusted for major covariates, the Johnson-Neyman technique defined two gait speed thresholds: < 0.77 m/s, indicating an aggravated adverse effect; and > 1.06 m/s, indicating a positive effect. Conclusions: The adverse effect of obesity on dependence in ADL is moderated by gait speed. Considering these thresholds, the distribution of older adults in each of the proposed areas of significance were: below 0.77 (m/s) = 14,324 (70.0%), above 1.06 (m/s) = 1553 older adults (7.5%) and between areas = 4630 older adults (22.5%).",Article,"Ramirez-Velez, R.; Perez-Sousa, M.A.; Venegas-Sanabria, L.C.; Chavarro-Carvajal, D.A.; Cano-Gutierrez, C.A.; Correa-Bautista, J.E.; Gonzalez-Ruiz, K.; Izquierdo, M.",Gait speed; Obesity; Dependence; Latin-American; Elderly,Gait speed;Obesity;Dependence;Latin-American;Elderly;INCIDENT DISABILITY;WALKING SPEED;MORTALITY;STRENGTH;DECLINE;PERFORMANCE;WEIGHT;PEOPLE;HEALTH;RISK,Spain;Colombia,

The aim of this study was to determine the prevalence of PCOS in women with ED in an outpatient program and to analyze the potential associations with BD. A total of 388 patients (88 with PCOS and 300 without PCOS) aged among 14 to 61 years were included in the study. Pelvic ultrasound, laboratory tests, and physical exams were performed to each participant. Bivariate analyses were carried out between PCOS, BD and other variables such as: psychiatric comorbidities, body mass index and type of ED. An association model was built. PCOS and BD prevalence were 22.7% and 13.1% respectively. The variables associated with PCOS were: BD type II, overweight or obesity and having an ED with binges and/or purges. When obesity and bulimic ED subtypes were controlled, patients with PCOS and BD type have 5.8 times higher risk of BD type II (OR = 5.85; 95% IC = 2.9-11.6).

Prostate cancer, on the other side, is the leading cause of cancer in men around the world. Several studies have suggested an association between the presence of metabolic syndrome and the diagnosis of prostate cancer. The information about the association of prostate cancer and obesity is controversial. Our objective is to determine if there is a relationship between the presence of obesity and the diagnosis of prostate cancer in older adults in the city of Bogotá. Objective and Methods Data from the Health, Wellbeing and Aging study (SABE) Bogotá 2012 were analyzed. Self-report of prostate exam in the last 2 years was used as a dependent variable and was evaluated with respect to anthropometric variables as well as sociodemographic factors through a multivariate analysis. Results The prevalence of prostate cancer was 3.15%. 31.9% of men have a BMI greater than 30. A significant association was found between BMI and the diagnosis of prostate cancer (p = 0.005), coronary disease and prostate cancer (p = 0.03) and level of education and diagnosis of prostate cancer (p = 0.012).

Results from ELANS Study,"Neck circumference (NC) is being used to identify the risk of chronic diseases. There is a high prevalence of overweight and obesity in Latin America, and neck circumference is a simple and practical measurement to assess this, especially in primary health centers.

We applied Pearson's correlation to identify the correlate NC with the other anthropometric variables stratified by sex; the sensitivity (Se) and specificity (Sp) by sex were evaluated according to the cut-off established with the Youden Index. The strongest correlations between NC and WC were found when stratified by sex (women: r = 0.71; men: r = 0.69, respectively) followed by the correlation between NC and BMI (r = 0.65, both sex). NC cut-off points of 39.0 cm in men and 32.9 cm in women identified those individuals with an increased WC and 39.8 and 33.7 cm, respectively, for a substantial increase in WC.

We report here a case of a surgical procedure for weight reduction in a hemodialysis patient and adjustment of dry weight through bioelectrical impedance. CASE PRESENTATION: A 44-year-old male with CKD on hemodialysis for 26 years. After 3 years on dialysis, he underwent a cadaveric kidney transplant. However, after 8 years of transplant, he loses the kidney graft and returns to dialysis treatment. The patient's BMI increased to 42 kg/m(2) and he had difficult-to-control hypertension and severe sleep apnea. Behavioral, nutritional and pharmacologic measures were not sufficient to achieve an adequate weight control. Thus, a surgical procedure for weight reduction was considered. The patient underwent a laparoscopic gastric sleeve without any complications. Dry weight was adjusted through bioelectrical impedance before each hemodialysis session. The patient did not display hypotension, cramps, or fluid overload. After a 30 kg weight loss, the patient's BMI was 28.3 kg/m(2), allowing registration on the kidney transplant waitlist. DISCUSSION: Obesity in CKD restricts access to kidney transplant waitlist. Bariatric surgery has proven to be safe and effective for sustained weight loss and it seems that the fact that a patient is dialysis dependent does not independently increase post-operatory complications. CONCLUSION: Surgical procedures for weight reduction in dialysis patients does not independently increase the risk for adverse outcomes after bariatric surgery. The estimation of DW through BIA is an effective method for avoiding complications generated by excessive or deficient ultrafiltration. (C) 2019 The Authors.

Methodology: A macro-simulation study was performed under three scenarios of future distributions of the body mass index: the first or of “Reference” (without intervening on the risk factor) and two interventions scenarios: the second consisting of a gradual reduction, accumulated over the first ten years, of 10 % of the difference between the expected and ideal mean values of the body mass index and sustaining these until 2050; and the third corresponding to achieve “Complete population with ideal Body Mass Index” as of 2017. Results: It was estimated that the proportions of cancers that could be avoided under the third scenario, would range between 8,0 % (colorectal cancer) and 16,7 % (liver cancer) among women and between 10,4 % (colorectal cancer) and 12,2 % (liver cancer) among men. The avoidable number of cases projected under the second scenario would correspond to approximately 4009 breast cancers (in women), 2086 colorectal cancers and 728 liver cancers, and under the third scenario to 48 410 breast cancers, 25 089 colorectal cancers and 8648 liver cancers. Conclusion: Interventions to reduce excess weight in the Colombian population, would especially contribute to avoid liver cancer in both sexes and the new cases of breast cancer (in women).",Article,"Unknown.; Herran, Oscar F.; Torres-Ibarguen, Miguel Zamir.; Diaz, Gustavo.; de Vries, Esther",Body mass index;Neoplasms;Obesity;Simulation,Body mass index;Neoplasms;Obesity;Simulation,Colombia;Colombia;Colombia;Colombia,

METHODS: An analytical observational study with retrospective data collection was conducted. We reviewed the medical records of all the patients who underwent radical prostatectomy between the years 2012-2014. The analysis of the data included a bivariate model to study the associations between BMI and the surgical procedure, its complications, oncologic outcomes and cancer follow-up. Then, we used multivariate logistic regression analysis to determine if there was an independent association between oncologic outcomes and BMI; the model was adjusted by age, hypertension and diabetes mellitus. RESULTS: 272 patients underwent radical prostatectomy: 98 (36.0%) had normal BMI, 142 (52.2%) were overweight and 32 (11.8%) were obese. The median age was 61 interquartile range (IQR=56-66) years old. There were no statistically significant differences in the preoperative and postoperative outcomes according to BMI. The obese patients had longer operative time (176 minutes, GR=165.0-195.5); nonetheless, the difference was not statistically significant (p=0.18). There were no complications during the procedure (rectal, vascular or obturator nerve injury). The multivariate analysis showed that age, hypertension and diabetes mellitus were not effect modifiers.

Sexual function was evaluated in men with the abbreviated sexual health inventory for men questionnaire (SHIM) and the self-esteem and relationship questionnaire (SEAR), and in women with the Female Sexual Function Index (IFSF). Quality of life with the SF-12 questionnaire. Nonparametric statistical tests were used. Results 19 patients were included. 13 women with an average age of 45.3 years (22-59) and 6 men with an average of 41 years (36-54). The average follow-up was 19 months (13.1-25.9). For IFSF, all the domains showed improvement, although desire variable was the only one with statistically significant difference (p = 0.027). The scores obtained with the SHIM scale show a decrease in the severity of erectile dysfunction from 16.8 (8-21) to 22.16 (18-25) (p = 0.059). In quality of life, women and men reported a statistically significant increase (p = 0.036 and p = 0.002, respectively). Conclusions Bariatric surgery has a highly favorable impact on quality of life and positive changes in all domains of sexual function of men and women. It is possible that these changes are influenced by physical and psychosocial variables that should be measured with future research.",Article,"Silva Herrera, Jose Miguel.; Puerto Nino, Angie.; Duarte, Andres.; Unknown.; Unknown",obesity;quality of life;sexual dysfunction,obesity;quality of life;sexual dysfunction,Colombia;Colombia,

Helicobacter pylori (H. pylori) is the cause of most peptic ulcers and gastric cancers. Many experts recommend routine investigation and eradication of the infection before RYGB. The prevalence of H. pylori and endoscopic alterations among patients scheduled for RYGB had not been studied before in our environment, so we decided to conduct this research. Materials and methods: Severely obese adult patients with no gastric symptoms who were scheduled for RYGB and preoperative upper endoscopy were included in this study. Results: From March 2007 to July 2014, 83 patients were included. 87.95% were women. Mean age was 46.9 +/- 11.4 years (17-62 years). H. pylori was found in 57.83% (95% CI 47.09 - 66.96%) which is similar to  the percentage of infections found in people who are not obese. 60% had some degree of erosive esophagitis including esophageal varices in two patients, and GIST in one patient. None had severe atrophy (OLGA III or IV). Conclusion: All patients had some alterations found during endoscopy. Two patients had esophageal varices. The prevalence of H. pylori is similar to that among people who are not obese.

Piper cumanense is a species characterized by the presence of bioactive constituents, particularly prenylated benzoic acid derivatives. In this study, the inhibitory potential of chemical constituents from P. cumanense and some synthesized compounds was determined on digestive enzymes (pancreatic lipase (PL) and α-glucosidase (AG)). The methodology included isolating and identifying secondary metabolites from P. cumanense, synthesizing some analogs, and a molecular docking study. The chemical study allowed the isolation of four prenylated benzoic acid derivatives (1–4). Four analogs (5–8) were synthesized. Seven compounds were found to significantly inhibit the catalytic activity of PL with IC50 values between 28.32 and 55.8 µM. On the other hand, only two compounds (6 and 7) were active as inhibitors of AG with IC50 values lower than 155 µM, standing out as the potential multitarget of these chromane compounds. Enzyme kinetics and molecular docking studies showed that the bioactive compounds mainly interact with amino acids other than those of the catalytic site in both PL and AG.

Obesity is a syndrome of multifactorial etiology characterized by an excessive accumulation and release of fatty acids (FA) in adipose and non-adipose tissue. An excess of FA generates a metabolic condition known as lipotoxicity, which triggers pathological cellular and molecular responses, causing dysregulation of homeostasis and a decrease in cell viability. This condition is a hallmark of NDs, and astrocytes are particularly sensitive to it, given their crucial role in energy production and oxidative stress management in the brain. However, analyzing cellular mechanisms associated with these conditions represents a challenge. In this regard, metabolomics is an approach that allows biochemical analysis from the comprehensive perspective of cell physiology. This technique allows cellular metabolic profiles to be determined in different biological contexts, such as those of NDs and specific metabolic insults, including lipotoxicity. Since data provided by metabolomics can be complex and difficult to interpret, alternative data analysis techniques such as machine learning (ML) have grown exponentially in areas related to omics data. Here, we developed an ML model yielding a 93% area under the receiving operating characteristic (ROC) curve, with sensibility and specificity values of 80% and 93%, respectively. This study aimed to analyze the metabolomic profiles of human astrocytes under lipotoxic conditions to provide powerful insights, such as potential biomarkers for scenarios of lipotoxicity induced by palmitic acid (PA). In this work, we propose that dysregulation in seleno-amino acid metabolism, urea cycle, and glutamate metabolism pathways are major triggers in astrocyte lipotoxic scenarios, while increased metabolites such as alanine, adenosine, and glutamate are suggested as potential biomarkers, which, to our knowledge, have not been identified in human astrocytes and are proposed as candidates for further research and validation.",Article,"Castellanos, D.B.; Martin-Jimenez, C.A.; Pinzon, A.; Barreto, G.E.; Padilla-Gonzalez, G.F.; Aristizabal, A.; Zuluaga, M.; Santos, J.G.",astrocytes; lipotoxicity; neurodegenerative diseases; obesity; metabolomics,astrocytes;lipotoxicity;neurodegenerative diseases;obesity;metabolomics;ENDOPLASMIC-RETICULUM STRESS;NF-KAPPA-B;PALMITATE;CELLS;NEURODEGENERATION;PATHOGENESIS;RESISTANCE;OXIDATION;GLUTAMINE;APOPTOSIS,Colombia;United States;Ireland;United Kingdom,2-s2.0-85135119961

Garcinia mangostana is an interesting species because there have been identified xanthones with the potential to inhibit these enzymes. In this study, the multitarget inhibitory potential of xanthones from G. mangostana against AA, AG and PL was assessed. The methodology included the isolation and identification of bioactive xanthones, the synthesis of some derivatives and a molecular docking study. The chemical study allowed the isolation of five xanthones (1–5).

The World Health Organization defines obesity as an increase in the percentage of body fat, generally accompanied by an increase in weight, the quantity and distribution of which determine the health of the individual. It is characterized by being a chronic disease and very difficult to manage. Bariatric surgery is an increasingly frequent procedure, which has proven to be the best therapeutic option for the management of moderate and severe obesity, a disease that has been gaining ground in the world. According to the 2015 National Survey of the Nutri-tional Situation in Colombia, the incidence of overweight was 37.8% and obesity was 18.7%. With the increase in primary bariatric surgery, the frequency of revision, conversion and reversal bariatric surgery has also increased, with conversion being the most frequent. Methods. Retrospective observational study in which patients underwent bariatric conversion surgery at the San Ignacio University Hospital between 2014 and 2019 were analyzed. Results. In our institution, conversion surgery corresponds to 8.8%, and coincides with the world statistics for this procedure. The most frequent cause, unlike the literature, is gastroesophageal reflux, followed by weight gain. Discussion.

Chronic exposure to high concentrations of FAs such as palmitic acid (pal) is a risk factor for developing different neurodegenerative diseases (NDs) through several mechanisms. In the brain, astrocytic dysregulation plays an essential role in detrimental processes like metabolic inflammatory state, oxidative stress, endoplasmic reticulum stress, and autophagy impairment. Evidence shows that tibolone, a synthetic steroid, induces neuroprotective effects, but its molecular mechanisms upon exposure to pal remain largely unknown. Due to the capacity of identifying changes in the whole data-set of proteins and their interaction allowing a deeper understanding, we used a proteomic approach on normal human astrocytes under supraphysiological levels of pal as a model to induce cytotoxicity, finding changes of expression in proteins related to translation, transport, autophagy, and apoptosis. Additionally, tibolone pre-treatment showed protective effects by restoring those same pal-altered processes and increasing the expression of proteins from cell survival processes. Interestingly, ARF3 and IPO7 were identified as relevant proteins, presenting a high weight in the protein-protein interaction network and significant differences in expression levels. These proteins are related to transport and translation processes, and their expression was restored by tibolone. This work suggests that the damage caused by pal in astrocytes simultaneously involves different mechanisms that the tibolone can partially revert, making tibolone interesting for further research to understand how to modulate these damages.",Article,"Vesga-Jimenez, D.J.; Martin-Jimenez, C.A.; Rodriguez, A.G.; Aristizabal-Pachon, A.F.; Pinzon, A.; Barreto, G.E.; Ramirez, D.; Gonzalez, J.",mass spectrometry; human astrocytes; tibolone; palmitic acid; obesity; neuroprotection; proteomics; network analysis,mass spectrometry;human astrocytes;tibolone;palmitic acid;obesity;neuroprotection;proteomics;network analysis;INDUCED UP-REGULATION;GLUTAMATE TRANSPORTERS;ENDOPLASMIC-RETICULUM;ELONGATION ARREST;NUCLEAR IMPORT;FATTY-ACIDS;RECEPTOR;MECHANISM;NEURONS;BETA,United States;Colombia;Ireland;Chile,2-s2.0-85131521126

Methods A cross-sectional study was conducted in Colombia, among 5237 older adults aged >= 60 years old (58.5% women, 70.5 +/- 7.8 years), according to 'SABE Survey 2015'. Handgrip strength data were obtained with a Takei dynamometer. Sociodemographic variables, five domains of intrinsic capacity (i.e. locomotion, vitality, cognition, psychological, and sensory), and medical conditions were assessed and analyzed. Adjustments variables were age, ethnicity, socio-economic status, urbanicity, body mass index, smoking status, alcohol intake, drug use, physical activity, and co-morbid chronic diseases. Sex-stratified analyses were conducted with logistic regression models. Results Handgrip strength was greater among men than among women (26.7 +/- 8.5 vs. 16.7 +/- 5.7 kg, respectively, P < 0.001) at all ages. Weak handgrip strength cut-off points ranged from 17.4 to 8.6 and from 10.1 to 4.9 in men and women, respectively. Overall, participants with optimal handgrip strength had better intrinsic capacity [in men, odds ratio (OR) = 0.62, 95% confidence interval (CI) 0.53 to 0.71; P < 0.001; and in women, OR = 0.79, 95% CI 0.68 to 0.92; P = 0.002] than their weaker counterparts. Also, men with optimal handgrip strength had a lower risk of hospitalization (OR = 0.47, 95% CI 0.29 to 0.78; P = 0.004) than their weaker counterparts. Conclusions This study is the first to describe handgrip strength values and cut-off points for muscle weakness among a nationally representative sample of Colombian older adults by age and sex.

In theory, there are income and expenditure thresholds associated with effective mitigation of household water insecurity, but there is little empirical research about these mechanisms and thresholds in low- and middle-income settings. This study used data from 3655 households from 23 water-insecure sites in 20 countries to explore the relationship between cash water expenditures (measured as a Z-score, percent of income, and Z-score of percent of income) and a household water insecurity score, and whether income moderated that relationship. We also assessed whether water expenditures moderated the relationships between water insecurity and both food insecurity and perceived stress. Using tobit mixed effects regression models, we observed a positive association between multiple measures of water expenditures and a household water insecurity score, controlling for demographic characteristics and accounting for clustering within neighborhoods and study sites. The positive relationships between water expenditures and water insecurity persisted even when adjusted for income, while income was independently negatively associated with water insecurity. Water expenditures were also positively associated with food insecurity and perceived stress. These results underscore the complex relationships between water insecurity, food insecurity, and perceived stress and suggest that water infrastructure interventions that increase water costs to households without anti-poverty and income generation interventions will likely exacerbate experiences of household water insecurity, especially for the lowest-income households.",Article,"Unknown.; Pearson, Amber L.; Unknown.; Unknown.; Mack, Elizabeth.; Unknown.; Rosinger, Asher Y.; Unknown.; Unknown.; Unknown.; Balogun, Mobolanle.; Unknown.; Unknown.; Unknown.; Unknown.; Unknown.; Escobar-Vargas, Jorge.; Unknown.; Unknown.; Unknown.; Unknown.; Unknown.; Unknown.; Unknown.; Unknown.; Unknown.; Unknown.; Unknown.; Unknown.; Unknown.; Unknown.; Unknown.; Unknown.; Unknown.; Unknown.; Unknown.; Unknown.; Trowell, Alex.; Unknown.; Unknown.; Unknown.; Unknown",Food insecurity;Global south;Mental health;Perceived stress;Water economics;Water insecurity,Food insecurity;Global south;Mental health;Perceived stress;Water economics;Water insecurity,Kenya;Lebanon;Canada;Colombia;United States;United States;United States;Nigeria;United States;United Kingdom;Iran;New Zealand;United States;United States;United States;United States;United States;United States;United States;United States;United States;United States;United States;United States;Netherlands;United States;Mexico,

In Australia, international students have been identified as disadvantaged compared with their peers; have weaker social support networks; and have higher rates of psychological distress. This scenario is acquiring significant relevance as Spanish-speaking migration is rapidly growing in Australia, and the mental health services for culturally and linguistically diverse populations are limited. Having a Spanish version (MHeC-S) of the Mental Health eClinic (MHeC) would greatly benefit these students. Objective: We used participatory design methodologies with users (young people aged 16-30 years, supportive others, and health professionals) to (1) conduct workshops with users to co-design and culturally adapt the MHeC; (2) inform the development of the MHeC-S alpha prototype; (3) test the usability of the MHeC-S alpha prototype; (4) translate, culturally adapt, and face-validate the MHeC-S self-report assessment; and (5) collect information to inform its beta prototype. Methods: A research and development cycle included several participatory design phases: co-design workshops; knowledge translation; language translation and cultural adaptation; and rapid prototyping and user testing of the MHeC-S alpha prototype. Results: We held 2 co-design workshops with 17 users (10 young people, 7 health professionals). A total of 15 participated in the one-on-one user testing sessions (7 young people, 5 health professionals, 3 supportive others). We collected 225 source documents, and thematic analysis resulted in 5 main themes (help-seeking barriers, technology platform, functionality, content, and user interface). A random sample of 106 source documents analyzed by 2 independent raters revealed almost perfect agreement for functionality (kappa=.86; P<.001) and content (kappa=.92; P<.001) and substantial agreement for the user interface (kappa=.785; P<.001). In this random sample, no annotations were coded for help-seeking barriers or the technology platform. Language was identified as the main barrier to getting medical or psychological services, and smartphones were the most-used device to access the internet. Acceptability was adequate for the prototype's 5 main elements: home page and triage system, self-report assessment, dashboard of results, booking and video visit system, and personalized well-being plan. The data also revealed gaps in the alpha prototype, such as the need for tailored assessment tools and a greater integration with Spanish-speaking services and communities. Spanish-language apps and e-tools, as well as online mental health information, were lacking. Conclusions: Through a research and development process, we co-designed and culturally adapted, developed and user tested, and evaluated the MHeC-S.

Between 1985 and 2012 an estimated of 220,000 Colombians have died and about 6,000,000 have been displaced by violence. Objective To describe and compare the prevalence of some problems and mental disorders in the adult population in Colombia, taking into account the characteristics of the municipality, as regards its history of violence or armed conflict. Methods The results for adults (over 18 years) of some problems and mental disorders were taken from the ENSM-2015. The municipalities were classified according to the presence and intensity of the conflict using the classification proposed by the CERAC. Disorders were measured using CIDI-CAPI, and problems with AUDIT, modified PCL (Post-Traumatic Stress Disorder Checklist). An estimate was also made of psychoactive substances consumption. Results A total of 10,870 people were interviewed, of whom 5,429 had not changed residence. There was had permanent conflict in 21.8% of the municipalities, 65.5% had a discontinued conflict, and only 12.7% had been pacified or had no conflict. The intensity of the conflict was reported as high by 31.8% of the people.

It is essential to have an improved knowledge of the magnitude of this issue and to design timely interventions that reduce long term complications. Objective The aim of the study was to determine the prevalence of the disorders in the last 12 months and 30 days according to the DSM-IV, as well as to collect data about social and demographic variables. Methods The structured Diagnostic Interview Schedule for Children (DISC-P), which provides DSM-IV diagnoses, was applied to carers of non-institutionalised children between 7 and 11 years old. The disorders evaluated included: major depressive disorder, dysthymia, generalised anxiety disorder, separation anxiety disorder, attention deficit hyperactivity disorder in its three kinds (mixed, inattentive, and hyperactive), oppositional defiant disorder, and conduct disorder. The instrumentation was computer-assisted. Results Prevalences of the disorders are present both in the last 30 days and in the last 12 months. In general, there is a prevalence of any of the disorders of 3% (95% CI, 2.2-4.0) in the last 30 days, and 4.7% (95% CI, 3.6-6.2) in the last 12 months. When evaluated individually, attention deficit hyperactivity disorder is the most frequent disorder, with a prevalence of 2.3% and 3.0% in the last 30 days and the last 12 months, respectively. In addition, the disorders that are known to frequently begin during childhood are the most common disorders in the age group studied, with a prevalence of 2.5% in the last 30 days and 3.2% in the last year. Conclusions The 2015 National Mental Health Survey provides precise information about the real mental situation in children between the ages of 7 and 11 years in Colombia, compared with past epidemiological studies in the country, which were restricted to specific populations.

A circular relationship has been considered in which poverty fosters the appearance of mental illness and this facilitates greater poverty. There are no studies in Colombia on this subject. Objective To describe the association between mental problems and disorders and poverty according to the Multidimensional Poverty Index (MPI) in Colombia. Material and methods Using the 2015 National Mental Health Survey, adjusted with the expansion factors for the population. The prevalences of mental problems and disorders obtained through semi-structured interviews employing the instruments SRQ-20, AUDIT C and A, modified PCL, familiar APGAR and CIDI CAPI. The poverty status was determined by the MPI. Results A total of 13,200 households were interviewed, of which 13.5% were classified as in a poverty condition, 6.3% of the adolescents of poor households reported a life-time prevalence of any mental disorder, and 4.6% in the last 12 months. On the other hand, the prevalences for the same age group not in a poverty condition were 7.2% and 3.3%, respectively. For adults in poverty, the prevalence of life-time mental disorders were 9.2%, with 4.3% in the last year, while those not considered poor showed prevalences of 9.1% and 3.9% for the same time periods.

However, despite the spread of such technologies in high-income countries, these technologies have not yet been commonly adopted in low- and middle-income countries. People living in these parts of the world are at risk of experiencing physical, technological, and social health inequalities. A possible solution is to utilize the currently available HITs developed in other counties. Objective: Using participatory design methodologies with Colombian end users (young people, their supportive others, and health professionals), this study aimed to conduct co-design workshops to culturally adapt a Web-based Mental Health eClinic (MHeC) for young people, perform one-on-one user-testing sessions to evaluate an alpha prototype of a Spanish version of the MHeC and adapt it to the Colombian context, and inform the development of a skeletal framework and alpha prototype for a Colombian version of the MHeC (MHeC-C). Methods: This study involved the utilization of a research and development (R&D) cycle including 4 iterative phases: co-design workshops; knowledge translation; tailoring to language, culture, and place (or context); and one-on-one user-testing sessions. Results: A total of 2 co-design workshops were held with 18 users-young people (n=7) and health professionals (n=11). Moreover, 10 users participated in one-on-one user-testing sessions-young people (n=5), supportive others (n=2), and health professionals (n=3). A total of 204 source documents were collected and 605 annotations were coded. A thematic analysis resulted in 6 themes (ie, opinions about the MHeC-C, Colombian context, functionality, content, user interface, and technology platforms). Participants liked the idea of having an MHeC designed and adapted for Colombian young people, and its 5 key elements were acceptable in this context (home page and triage system, self-report assessment, dashboard of results, booking and video-visit system, and personalized well-being plan). However, to be relevant in Colombia, participants stressed the need to develop additional functionality (eg, phone network backup; chat; geolocation; and integration with electronic medical records, apps, or electronic tools) as well as an adaptation of the self-report assessment. Importantly, the latter not only included language but also culture and context. Conclusions: The application of an R&D cycle that also included processes for adaptation to Colombia (language, culture, and context) resulted in the development of an evidence-based, language-appropriate, culturally sensitive, and context-adapted HIT that is relevant, applicable, engaging, and usable in both the short and long term. The resultant R&D cycle allowed for the adaptation of an already available HIT (ie, MHeC) to the MHeC-C-a low-cost and scalable technology solution for low- and middle-income countries like Colombia, which has the potential to provide young people with accessible, available, affordable, and integrated mental health care at the right time.",Article,"Ospina-Pinillos, L.; Davenport, T.A.; Navarro-Mancilla, A.A.; Cheng, V.W.S.; Alarcon, A.C.C.; Rangel, A.M.; Rueda-Jaimes, G.E.; Gomez-Restrepo, C.; Hickie, I.B.",Colombia; telemedicine; medical informatics; eHealth; mental health; cultural characteristics; cultural competency; ethnic groups; quality of health care; community-based participatory research; primary health care; patient participation; patient preference; patient satisfaction; consumer health information; methods; research design,Colombia;telemedicine;medical informatics;eHealth;mental health;cultural characteristics;cultural competency;ethnic groups;quality of health care;community-based participatory research;primary health care;patient participation;patient preference;patient satisfaction;consumer health information;methods;research design;DSM-IV;DISORDERS;CARE;ADAPTATION;BEHAVIORS;VALIDITY,Australia;Colombia,2-s2.0-85097854469

Objective To describe the selection and definition of the tools used to measure mental health (including social cognition and violence), problems, mental disorders, and the evaluation of health states, as well as to describe the process used to develop the data collection tools finally used. Results The measurement of mental disorders in children was performed using the Diagnostic Interview Schedule for Children (DISC), and the Composite International Diagnostic Interview (CIDI) was used for adolescents and adults. For the remaining components evaluated in the survey, a search was conducted on the tools used at a national and international level. The selection of the toos used for the evaluation was based on the questions made by each tool, as well as the scientific validity that could be obtained from the results. In some cases the complete tool (as published) was used, in other cases the tools were constructed unifying parts of different ones, or questions were written based on the concepts or characteristics to be measured. Subsequently, a validation of content, concept and semantic of every tool was carried out, including the CIDI and DISC. The resulting tools were used on a group of people with different characteristics. It was noted that further clarification was necessary for some people to fully understand what was being asked. Because the collection of all the information in the survey would be computer assisted, a stream format was generated to guide the implementation in Blaise software, after the creation and wording of each tool in order to review the validation process of the survey and to ensure the integrity in the order of questions and their format.

It is estimated that around 10% of adolescents have mental disorders that require attention and are generally not recognised as such. The aim was to determine potential factors associated with whether or not mental disorders and problems are recognised in the Colombian population. Methods: Adolescents aged 12 to 17 who said they had been diagnosed with a mental health problem or disorder by a healthcare professional were identified from the National Mental Health Survey conducted in Colombia in 2015. This group was compared with those who scored positive for mental disorders measured by CIDI 3.0 or mental problems detected by SRQ-20. Results: A sample of 1,754 adolescents was obtained, of whom 7.3% (n = 129) had disorders and 22.6% (n = 396) had problems. Of the total with disorders and problems, 13.9% (n = 18) of people with disorders and 8.3% (n = 33) with problems knew they had them. Bivariate analyses were performed with the possible related variables, and with the results we constructed a multivariate regression model that identified factors associated with the recognition of disorders or problems, such as family dysfunction (OR = 2.5; 95% CI, 1.3-4.5) or counting on family when having financial problems (OR = 2.7; 95% CI, 1.0-7.2).

Under the Sentencia T 025 the Colombian constitutional court obliges the government to recognize the existence of forced internal displacement and states mandatory the provision of mental health attention to victims. I suggest that this dominium of the public policy in mental health for victims of sociopolitical violence is a biopolitic exercise, where the devices mainly used in public mental health such as population and individuals act upon certain groups focalizing interventions. This mediation acts under the naturalization of trauma, vulnerability and risk, and has the final effect of the medicalization of society.",Article,"Restrepo-Espinosa, Maria Helena",Biopolitics;Forced internal displacement and health governance;Mental health;Public health policy;Victimhood,Biopolitics;Forced internal displacement and health governance;Mental health;Public health policy;Victimhood,Colombia,

Second, survey findings guided an in-person workshop to generate implementation recommendations to inform the field. Results: In total, 46 respondents completed surveys, and 101 researchers attended the workshop. The workshop produced implementation recommendations for low-resource settings: 1) identifying impact of research on policy and practice; 2) sustaining careers of early researchers in global mental health; 3) engaging policymakers and donors to value mental health research; 4) supporting the workforce for delivering evidence-based treatments for mental disorders; and 5) promoting sustainability of programs.

Up to a quarter of the population has reported mental health disorders. This has been studied mainly from a nosological perspective, according to diagnostic criteria. Nevertheless, we did not find studies that have explored the daily expressions of the population. Our objective was to evaluate the perceptions of the COVID-19 pandemic and its repercussions on the emotional well-being of the Colombian population. Methods: We performed a Twitter metrics and trend analysis. Initially, in the trend analysis, we calculated the average duration in hours of the 20 most popular trending topics of the day in Colombia and we grouped them into trends related to COVID-19 and unrelated trends. Subsequently, we identified dates of events associated with the pandemic relevant to the country, and they were related to the behaviour of the trends studied. Additionally, we did an exploratory analysis of these, selected the tweets with the greatest reach and categorised them in an inductive way to analyse them qualitatively. Results: Issues not related to COVID-19 were more far-reaching than those related to coronavirus. However, a rise in these issues was seen on some dates consistent with important events in Colombia. We found expressions of approval and disapproval, solidarity and accusation.

An association between affective and anxiety disorders has been proposed in adolescents with substance use. Objective. To determine the prevalence of psychoactive substance use and the most frequent mental disorders associated with this consumption, in Colombian adolescents. Methods. This is a cross-sectional study that uses data from the National Mental Health Survey 2015. With adolescents between 12 and 17 years old, in whom CIDI-CAPI (version 21.1.3) was applied by computer and modified ASSIST. Results. A total of 408 adolescents between 12 and 17 years old who reported psychoactive substance use at least once in their lives were described , this group was a representative sample of national population. The most frequent consumed substance was alcohol with a prevalence of 16.6% (95% CI, 14.2-19.2), Bogotá is the region with the highest consumption of substances with a prevalence of 33.8% (IC95 % 24.7-44.2). Otherwise, being a man between 16 and 17 years old represents a risk factor for substance use. Likewise, presenting affective disorders increases by 2.28 times the risk of psychoactive substance use. Conclusions. Adolescents with affective or anxiety disorders are at higher risk of psychoactive substances use, making difficult the treatment and desmonstrating the vulnerability of this population.",Article,"Cruz-Ramirez, Viviana.; Gomez-Restrepo, Carlos.; Rincon, Carlos Javier",Adolescents;Mental health;National Mental Health Survey 2015;Substance-related disorder,Adolescents;Mental health;National Mental Health Survey 2015;Substance-related disorder,Colombia,

We aimed to describe perceived changes in ease of access to general and mental healthcare among patients with a diagnosis of depression and/or unhealthy alcohol use in Colombia. Methods: This study is embedded in the DIADA project, a multicenter implementation research study aimed at evaluating the integration of mental healthcare in primary care in Colombia. Between November 2020 and August 2021, we conducted a COVID-19 pandemic impact assessment in a cohort of participants with newly diagnosed depression and/or unhealthy alcohol use part of DIADA project. We assessed the ease of access and factors related to perceived ease of access to general or mental healthcare, during the COVID-19 pandemic. Results: 836 participants completed the COVID-19 pandemic impact assessment. About 30% of participants considered their mental health to be worse during the pandemic and 84.3% perceived access to general healthcare to be worse during the pandemic. Most of participants (85.8%) were unable to assess access to mental health services, but a significant proportion considered it to be worse. Experiencing worse ease of access to general healthcare was more frequent among women, patients with diagnosis of depression, and patients with comorbidities. Experiencing worse ease of access to mental healthcare was more frequent among patients aged between 30 and 49.9 years, from socioeconomic status between 4 and 6, affiliated to the contributive social security regime, attending urban study sites, and those who perceived their mental health was worse during the pandemic. Discussion: Despite the overall perception of worse mental health during the pandemic, the use of mental healthcare was low compared to general healthcare. Ease of access was perceived to be worse compared to pre-pandemic. Ease of access and access were affected by geographical study site, socioeconomic status, age and gender. Our findings highlight the need for improved communication between patients and institutions, tailored strategies to adapt the healthcare provision to patients' characteristics, and continued efforts to strengthen the role of mental healthcare provision in primary care.",Article,"Gomez-Restrepo, Carlos.; Cepeda, Magda.; Torrey, William C.; Suarez-Obando, Fernando.; Uribe, Jose Miguel.; Unknown.; Unknown.; Unknown.; Castro-Diaz, Sergio.; Unknown.; Unknown.; Unknown.; Unknown.; Unknown.; Marsch, Lisa A.",COVID-19;depression;healthcare access;mental health;mental healthcare;primary health care;unhealthy alcohol use,COVID-19;depression;healthcare access;mental health;mental healthcare;primary health care;unhealthy alcohol use,Colombia;Colombia;United States;United States,

As such, information and communication technologies (ICT) have enormous potential to enable or impair help-seeking and patient-professional interactions. Youth studies indicate that ICT searches are undertaken before initial mental health consultations, but no publications have considered how this online activity affects the first steps of the patient journey in youth mental health settings. Methods: State-of-the-art review using an iterative, evidence mapping approach to identify key literature and expert consensus to synthesize and prioritise clinical and research issues. Results: Adolescents and young adults are more likely to seek health advice via online search engines or social media platforms than from a health professional. Young people not only search user-generated content and social media to obtain advice and support from online communities but increasingly contribute personal information online. Conclusions: A major clinical challenge is to raise professional awareness of the likely impact of this activity on mental health consultations. Potential strategies range from modifying the structure of clinical consultations to ensure young people are able to disclose ICT activities related to mental health, through to the development and implementation of ‘internet prescriptions’ and a youth-focused ‘toolkit’.",Article,"Scott, Jan.; Unknown.; Unknown.; Unknown.; Unknown.; Hickie, Ian B.",adolescents;help-seeking behaviour;Internet;mental health;online,adolescents;help-seeking behaviour;Internet;mental health;online,Colombia;United Kingdom;Australia;Australia;United States,

Screening and addressing at-risk drinking in primary care settings is an empirically supported health care intervention strategy to help reduce the burden of alcohol-use problems. In preparation for introducing screening and treatment for at-risk drinking in primary care clinics in Colombia, we conducted interviews with clinicians, clinic administrators, patients, and participants in Alcoholics Anonymous. Interviews were conducted within the framework of the Detección y Atención Integral de Depresión y Abuso de Alcohol en Atención Primaria (DIADA [Detection and Integrated Care for Depression and Alcohol Use in Primary Care] www.project-diada.org) research project, and its qualitative phase that consisted of the collection of data from 15 focus groups, 6 interviews and field observations in 5 regional settings. All participants provided informed consent to participate in this research. Findings revealed the association of harmful alcohol use with a culture of consumption, within which it is learned and socially accepted practice. Recognition of harmful alcohol consumption includes a social context that influences its screening, diagnosis and prevention. The discussion highlights how, despite the existence of institutional strategies in healthcare settings and the awareness of the importance of at-risk drinking among health personnel, the recognition of the harmful use of alcohol as a pathology should be embedded in an understanding of historical, social and cultural dimensions that may affect different identification and care scenarios.",Article,"Unknown.; Medina Ch.; Ana Maria.; Gomez-Restrepo, Carlos.; Unknown.; Torrey, William C.; Unknown.; Bartels, S.

Methods: We carried a cross sectional study using a web-based survey to assess mental health and personal impact among 18 to 24 years old living in Bogotá during the first 4 months of the 2020 COVID-19 pandemic lockdown. The depressive symptoms were measured with PHQ-8 and anxiety symptoms with (GAD-7). We also designed a questionnaire exploring changes in personal, family and social life. Results: Overall, 23% of the sample (n = 834) reported mild depressive symptoms (males 24% and females 23%); 29% reported moderate depressive symptoms (males 28%, females 30%); 22% moderate-severe symptoms (males 20%, females 23%) and 17% severe symptoms (males 15%, females 17%). Mild anxiety symptoms were reported by 29% of the sample (males 30%, females 29%); moderate anxiety symptoms by 29% (males 26%, females 30%); moderate-severe 18% (males 15%, females 20%) and severe anxiety by 6.0% (males 6.0% and females 6.0%).

Despite this, it is estimated that only about a third of the people affected is able to recognise problems on their own and to access health services. The aim was to determine the factors associated with the lack of self-recognition of mental problems and disorders in the Colombian population. Methods: The National Mental Health Survey (ENSM-2015) conducted in Colombia identified adults over 18 years that answered “yes’ to the question ‘Have you had a mental problem or disorder?’, had a positive score in mental disorders measured by the Composite International Diagnostic Interview (CIDI) 3.0, or in mental problems detected by the SRQ-20. A bivariate analysis, as well as a logistic regression, were performed with possible related variables. Results: A sample of 10, 870 adults was obtained, of whom 12.25% (1,332) had mental disorders and 30.2% (3282) had mental problems. Of those individuals with disorders and problems, 7.9% recognised themselves as affected. The variables associated with self-recognition of disorders or problems were, among others: being female (OR = 1.8; 95%CI, 1.4-2.3), family dysfunction (OR = 1.5; 95%CI, 1.2-2.0), to have experienced a traumatic event (OR = 1.8; 95%CI, 1.4-2.2), illegal substance consumption (OR = 0.5; 95%CI, 0.4-0.7), not being poor (OR = 1.9; 95%CI, 1.2-3.0), and having chronic illnesses (OR = 1.6; 95%CI, 1.3-2.1).

The objective of this paper is to describe the model and the findings of the implementation of a technology-based model of care for depression and unhealthy alcohol use in primary care centres in Colombia. Methods: Between February 2018 and March 2020, we implemented a technology-based model of care for depression and unhealthy alcohol use, following a modified stepped wedge methodology, in 6 urban and rural primary care centres in Colombia. The model included a series of steps aimed at screening patients attending medical appointments with general practitioners and supporting the diagnosis and treatment given by the general practitioner. We describe the model, its implementation and the characteristics of the screened and assessed patients. Results: During the implementation period, we conducted 22,354 screenings among 16,188 patients. The observed rate of general practitioner-confirmed depression diagnosis was 10.1% and of confirmed diagnosis of unhealthy alcohol use was 1.3%. Patients with a depression diagnosis were primarily middle-aged women, while patients with unhealthy alcohol use were mainly young adult men. Discussion: The provision of training and technology-based strategies to screen patients and support the decision-making of general practitioners during the medical appointment enhanced the diagnosis and care provision of patients with depression and unhealthy alcohol use. However, time constraints, as well as structural and cultural barriers, were challenges for the implementation of the model, and the model should take into account local values, policies and resources to guarantee its long-term sustainability. As such, the long-term sustainability of the model will depend on the alignment of different stakeholders, including decision-makers, institutions, insurers, general practitioners, patients and communities, to reduce the amount of patients seeking medical care whose mental health conditions remain undetected, and therefore untreated, and to ensure an appropriate response to the demand for mental healthcare that was revealed by the implementation of our model.",Article,"Gomez-Restrepo, Carlos.; Cepeda, Magda.; Torrey, William C.; Castro-Diaz, Sergio.; Uribe, Jose Miguel.; Suarez-Obando, Fernando.; Marsch, Lisa A.",Depression;Mental health;Primary care;Technology;Unhealthy alcohol use,Depression;Mental health;Primary care;Technology;Unhealthy alcohol use,Colombia;Colombia;Colombia;United States,

In Latin America, young people living in deprived urban areas face various risk factors for mental distress. However, most either do not develop mental distress in the form of depression and anxiety, or recover within a year without treatment from mental health services. This research programme seeks to identify the personal and social resources that help young people to prevent and recover from mental distress. Methods and analysis A cross-sectional study will compare personal and social resources used by 1020 young people (aged 15-16 and 20-24 years) with symptoms of depression and/or anxiety and 1020 without. A longitudinal cohort study will follow-up young people with mental distress after 6 months and 1 year and compare resource use in those who do and do not recover. An experience sampling method study will intensively assess activities, experiences and mental distress in subgroups over short time periods. Finally, we will develop case studies highlighting existing initiatives that effectively support young people to prevent and recover from mental distress. The analysis will assess differences between young people with and without distress at baseline using t-tests and chi(2) tests. Within the groups with mental distress, multivariate logistic regression analyses using a random effects model will assess the relationship between predictor variables and recovery.

Subsequently, to describe access to healthcare for depression and unhealthy alcohol use, excerpts from the interviews and focus groups were coded through content analysis, expert consensus, and grounded theory. Five categories of analysis were created: education and knowledge of the health condition, stigma, lack of training of health professionals, culture, and structure or organisational factors. Results: We characterised the barriers to a lack of illness recognition that affected access to care for depression or unhealthy alcohol use according to users, healthcare professionals and administrative staff from five primary and secondary care centres in Colombia. The groups identified that lack of recognition of depression was related to low education and knowledge about this condition within the population, stigma, and lack of training of health professionals, as well as to culture. For unhealthy alcohol use, the participants identified that low education and knowledge about this condition, lack of training of healthcare professionals, and culture affected its recognition, and therefore, healthcare access. Neither structural nor organisational factors seemed to play a role in the recognition or self-recognition of these conditions. Conclusions: This study provides essential information for the search for factors that undermine access to mental health in the Colombian context. Likewise, it promotes the generation of hypotheses that can lead to the development and implementation of tools to improve care in the field of mental illness.",Article,"Gomez-Restrepo, Carlos.; Unknown.; Marroquin-Rivera, Arturo.; Cepeda, Magda.; Suarez-Obando, Fernando.; Uribe, Jose Miguel.; Castro-Diaz, Sergio.; Cubillos, Leonardo.; Torrey, William C.; Bartels, S.

It has been proposed that this gap be reduced by strengthening and making use of community resources. This study explores the feasibility and one-year outcomes of a novel volunteer programme for patients with bipolar disorder and schizophrenia. Methods: In a non-controlled trial with a total of 30 patients, we instigated activities in groups of 5 people with severe mental disorders and individuals from the community. Symptoms, quality of life and social functioning before the intervention and after six and 12 months were assessed and compared using Student's t-test. Results: The volunteer intervention was feasible in the Colombian context. Social functioning after 6 months was improved, mainly due to an improvement in the domains of employment and friendship. However, the difference was no longer statistically significant after 12 months. Conclusions: In a country where there is a large gap in coverage and access to specialized mental health services, it is important to integrate effective and low-cost interventions that improve the mental health of the population through community resources. This intervention improved the social functioning of the patients, which indicates an effective and feasible intervention for implementation in our context. Nevertheless, the intervention may have to be continued beyond six months to maintain the reported improvements.",Article,"Botero-Rodriguez, Felipe.; Uribe, Jose Miguel.; Unknown.; Unknown.; Unknown.; Gomez-Restrepo, Carlos",Global mental health;Mental health;Severe mental illness;Volunteering,Global mental health;Mental health;Severe mental illness;Volunteering,Colombia;Colombia;United Kingdom,
,,,0,2-s2.0-85102894889,2021,A characterisation of social media users within the Primary Care System in Colombia and predictors of their social media use to understand their health,"Introduction: Social media use is growing in Latin America and is increasingly being used in innovative ways. This study sought to characterise the profile of social media users, among primary care patients in Colombia, and to assess predictors of their use of social media to search for health and mental health information (searching behaviour). Methods: As part of a larger scale-up study, we surveyed 1,580 patients across six primary care sites in Colombia about their social media use. We used chi-square and Student's t-tests to assess associations between demographic variables, social media use and searching behaviour, and a Chi-square Automatic Interaction Detector (CHAID) analysis to determine predictors of searching behaviour. Results: In total, 44.4% of respondents reported that they were social media users. Of these, 35.7% used social media to search for health-related information and 6.6% used it to search for mental health-related information. While the profile of individuals who used social media to search for health-related information was similar to that of general social media users (the highest use was among women living in urban areas), the presence of mental health symptoms was a more important predictor of using social media to search for mental health-related information than demographic variables. Individuals with moderate-severe symptoms of anxiety reported a significantly higher percentage of searching than individuals without symptoms (12.5% vs. 5.2%). Conclusions: Given that some individuals with mental health disorders turn to social media to understand their illness, social media could be a successful medium for delivering mental health interventions in Colombia.",Article,"Bartels, S.

Victims of violence and armed conflicts have higher rates of mental health disorders, and children and adolescents are particularly affected. However, the mental health needs of this population are often overlooked, especially in low- and middle-Income countries, where scarcity of resources exacerbates the problem that has been further compounded by the global COVID-19 pandemic. Thus, special attention should be paid to the development of interventions that target this population. Objective: Our research aims to adapt an existing patient-centered digital intervention called DIALOG+ from a clinical setting to an educational setting using stakeholders' (teachers'and students') perspectives. We aim to evaluate the feasibility, acceptability, and estimated effect of implementing this intervention as a tool for the identification and mobilization of personal and social resources to mitigate the impact of social difficulties and to promote mental well-being. Methods: We will conduct an exploratory mixed methods study in public schools of postconflict areas in Tolima, Colombia. The study consists of 3 phases: adaptation, exploration, and consolidation of the DIALOG+ tool. The adaptation phase will identify possible changes that the intervention requires on the basis of data from focus groups with teachers and students. The exploration phase will be an exploratory cluster randomized trial with teachers and school counselors to assess the acceptability, feasibility, and estimated effect of DIALOG+ for adolescents in school settings. Adolescents' data about mental health symptoms and wellness will be collected before and after DIALOG+ implementation. During this phase, teachers or counselors who were part of the intervention group will share their opinions through the think-aloud method. Lastly, the consolidation phase will consist of 2 focus groups with teachers and students to discuss their experiences and to understand acceptability. Results: Study recruitment was completed in March 2022, and follow-up is anticipated to last through November 2022. Conclusions: This exploratory study will evaluate the acceptability, feasibility, and estimated effect of DIALOG+ for adolescents in postconflict school settings in Colombia. The use of this technology-supported tool aims to support interactions between teachers or counselors and students and to provide an effective student-centered communication guide. This is an innovative approach in both the school and the postconflict contexts that could help improve the mental health and wellness of adolescents in vulnerable zones in Colombia. Subsequent studies will be needed to evaluate the effectiveness of DIALOG+ in an educational context as a viable option to reduce the gap and inequities of mental health care access.",Article,"Gomez-Restrepo, Carlos.; Sarmiento-Suarez, Maria Jose.; Unknown.; Unknown.; Unknown.; Unknown",acceptability;adolescence;adolescent;adolescent health;armed conflict;child;computer-mediated intervention;digital health;digital intervention;eHealth;feasibility;mental disorder;mental health;mental well-being;post-conflict;psychological support;psychosocial intervention;psychosocial well-being;resilience;resource-oriented approach;school;student;teacher;vulnerable;youth,acceptability;adolescence;adolescent;adolescent health;armed conflict;child;computer-mediated intervention;digital health;digital intervention;eHealth;feasibility;mental disorder;mental health;mental well-being;post-conflict;psychological support;psychosocial intervention;psychosocial well-being;resilience;resource-oriented approach;school;student;teacher;vulnerable;youth,Colombia;Colombia;United Kingdom,
,,,0,2-s2.0-85101366558,2021,Characterizing the perceived stigma towards mental health in the early implementation of an integrated services model in Primary Care in Colombia. A qualitative analysis,"Background: Stigma is a sociocultural barrier to accessing mental health services and prevents individuals with mental health disorders from receiving mental health care. The Ministry of Health and Social Protection of Colombia acknowledges that a great number of people with mental disorders do not seek medical aid due to stigma. Objectives: Characterise the perceived stigma towards mental health among the stakeholders involved in the early implementation of the DIADA project [Detección y Atención Integral de Depresión y Abuso de Alcohol en Atención Primaria (Detection and Integrated Care for Depression and Alcohol Use in Primary Care)]. Explore whether the implementation of this model can decrease stigma. Describe the impact of the implementation on the lives of patients and medical practice. Materials and methods: Eighteen stakeholders (7 patients, 5 physicians and 6 administrative staff) were interviewed and a secondary data analysis of 24 interview transcripts was conducted using a rapid analysis technique. Results: The main effects of stigma towards mental health disorders included refusing medical attention, ignoring illness, shame and labelling. Half of the stakeholders reported that the implementation of mental health care in primary care could decrease stigma. All of the stakeholders said that the implementation had a positive impact. Conclusions: The perceived stigma was characterised as social and aesthetic in nature. Communication and awareness about mental health is improving, which could facilitate access to mental health treatment and strengthen the doctor-patient relationship. Culture is important for understanding stigma towards mental health in the population studied.",Article,"Unknown.; Cardenas Charry, Maria Paula.; Uribe, Jose Miguel.; Cepeda, Magda.; Cubillos, Leonardo.; Bartels, S.

Since then they have become a device broadly used worldwide with an important commercial activity. Unfortunately, they have an equivalent or even greater risk for multiple harmful health outcomes when compared with conventional cigarettes. Nevertheless, these devices are perceived less harmful or addictive, and are more socially accepted. Additionally, most users belong to the teenage population, which is characterized by greater vulnerability due to the ongoing neurodevelopment process. Objective: Conduct a thematic review of the electronic cigarettes, their regulatory policies, consumption patterns and described associations with mental health. Methodology: A search for secondary studies was conducted in PubMed and SciELO databases using MeSH, DeCS and free terms. Review results were performed according to the aimed topics for evaluation. Finally, 54 articles were obtained after the screening process. Discussion: The influence of nicotine on adolescent brain development is well described, just as their consumption trend and the regulatory measures that have been implemented. The high risk for mental health in adolescents that represent electronic cigarettes, added to poor regulations in our country, generates the need to strengthen prevention and intervention systems for nicotine consumption, as well as stringent commercial policies against its sale modalities.",Review,"Botero-Rodriguez, F.; Rivera, A.M.; Leal, A.; Mendez, C.C.; Gomez-Restrepo, C.",electronic nicotine delivery systems; electronic cigarette; adolescent; public health; mental health,electronic nicotine delivery systems;electronic cigarette;adolescent;public health;mental health;E-CIGARETTES;HEALTH;SMOKING;ADULTS;EXPOSURE;TRENDS;POLICY;RISK,Colombia,

Emerging literature highlights the importance of social networks for resiliency and well-being. This study explores the experiences of Venezuelan immigrants in central Florida, factors that have promoted resilience, and considerations for mental health providers to meet the needs of this population. Method: A phenomenological approach was used to engage Venezuelan immigrants who had been in the United States for at least 6 months (n = 48) in dialogue about forced migration, identity, and adaptation. Five focus groups using a semistructured format were conducted to explore aspects of the experience before, during, and after migration. Recruitment was done through word of mouth and community gatekeepers. Results: Participants were 54% female with an average age of 45, 85% had at least 1 college degree, and more than half left Venezuela since 2011. Themes were identified from the focus group transcripts and clustered into three broad areas: characteristics and individual experiences, mental health, and family and social context. Major findings included the need for culturally responsive mental health support, which appeared to mitigate distress and the centrality of social networks in support of resiliency. Conclusions: Findings from the present study suggest that community context, support for ethnic identity, and the ability to foster meaningful connections to others with similar experience and identity are critical factors in resilience.",Article,"Unknown.; Wharton, Tracy.; Unknown.; Unknown.; Unknown",Immigration;Mental health;Resilience;Social networks;Venezuela,Immigration;Mental health;Resilience;Social networks;Venezuela,United States;Colombia;United States,

Design A multimethod, qualitative study with 18 online focus groups and 12 online structured group conversations embedded into arts workshops. Setting This study was conducted in Bogota (Colombia), Buenos Aires (Argentina) and Lima (Peru). Participants Adolescents (15-16 years old) and young adults (20-24 years old) with capacity to provide assent/consent and professionals (older than 18 years of age) that had experience of professionally working with young people were willing to share personal experience within a group, and had capacity to provide consent. Results A total of 185 participants took part in this study: 111 participants (36 adolescents, 35 young adults and 40 professionals) attended the 18 focus groups and 74 young people (29 adolescents and 45 young adults) took part in the 12 arts workshops. Eight categories captured the resources and activities that were reported by young people as helpful to overcome mental distress: (1) personal resources, (2) personal development, (3) spirituality and religion, (4) social resources, (5) social media, (6) community resources, (7) activities (subcategorised into artistic, leisure, sports and outdoor activities) and (8) mental health professionals. Personal and social resources as well as artistic activities and sports were the most common resources identified that help adolescents and young adults to overcome depression and anxiety. Conclusion Despite the different contexts of the three cities, young people appear to use similar resources to overcome mental distress. Policies to improve the mental health of young people in deprived urban settings should address the need of community spaces, where young people can play sports, meet and engage in groups, and support community organisations that can enable and facilitate a range of social activities.",Article,"Toyama, M.; Godoy-Casasbuenas, N.; Olivar, N.; Brusco, L.I.; Carbonetti, F.; Diez-Canseco, F.; Gomez-Restrepo, C.; Heritage, P.; Hidalgo-Padilla, L.; Uribe, M.; Steffen, M.; Fung, C.; Priebe, S.",mental health; qualitative research; child & adolescent psychiatry; depression & mood disorders,mental health;qualitative research;child & adolescent psychiatry;depression & mood disorders;RESILIENCE;HEALTH;DEPRESSION;ADOLESCENTS,Peru;Colombia;Argentina;United Kingdom,2-s2.0-85136342169

Information obtained focused on the expectations and experiences related to their journey, social and family relationships, and the socioeconomic context in which they currently perceive themselves, as well as information related to their emotional, physical, and cognitive reactions before, during, and after their journey. The majority of participants in this study described political or economic reasons for leaving their country of origin, and for more than half, motives related to future conditions for their children. Four out of 5 immigrants indicated stress, and 3 out of 5 reported significant sadness or frustration and feeling that they had no control over their situation. Out of 5 participants reported feelings of isolation since arriving in Florida. This is an important insight, as isolation is an important predictor of mental health challenges, and lack of social network support is related to limited resiliency.",Article,"Novella, Andres Cubillos.; Unknown.; Wharton, Tracy",Mental health;Migrant;United States;Venezuela,Mental health;Migrant;United States;Venezuela,Colombia;United States,

This study aimed at analyzing the traumatic experience many years ago on the current psycho-emotional status of displaced families as well as the ongoing inequalities regarding displaced and non-displaced communities in one of the most affected areas by the armed conflict. An interview survey was conducted among 211 displaced families and 181 non-displaced families in 2 adjacent compounds in Valledupar, Colombia. The questionnaire used questions from the validated national survey and was revised and applied by staff members of the departmental secretary of health who conducted additional in-depth interviews. The study showed that the living conditions of the displaced community were precarious. The past traumatic events many years ago and the current difficult living conditions are associated with psychological problems being more frequent among the displaced people. The displaced people had experienced more violent acts and subsequently had a larger number of emotional symptoms (fright, headache, nervousness, depression, and sleeplessness). Other stress factors like economic problems, severe disease or death of family members and unemployment prevailed among displaced persons. The non-displaced lived in a more protected environment with less exposure to violence and stress, although belonging to a similarly low socio-economic stratum.

Searches were done through the search engine Pubmed. Additionally, public institution websites for each country were consulted. Conclusions: Juvenile delinquency is now understood as a multi-factorial phenomenon with multiple areas of intervention within which economic, domestic and social factors are considered relevant, since these favor the development of criminal behavior. A similarity was found between Colombian and Argentinian systems; both are based on restorative justice that seeks reparation and not punishment; which is why there are no punitive measures.

However, there is limited research focusing on this field and this specific population. Objective: To estimate the prevalence of dermatological pathologies in the Colombian adolescent population and their possible associations with mental health conditions. Methods: We performed a secondary analysis of the Colombian National Mental Health Survey results. A representative sample of the adolescent Colombian population answered questions regarding dermatological conditions and mental health disorders. We estimated the prevalence and evaluated associations using the chi squared independence test. Results: Of 1753 adolescents, 8.3% (CI95%=[6.8-10.1]) had dermatitis or skin allergies and 4.5% (CI95%=[3.3-6.1]) acne. For dermatitis, we found associations with age, education, and family dysfunction (p-Values=0.024; <0.001; 0.046 respectively). Acne was associated with age, sex, educational level, the number of social groups involved in, alcohol consumption, psychoactive substances use and previous violent experiences (respective p-Values=0.007; 0.004; 0.005; 0.036; 0.002; 0.003; 0.044). Regarding mental health, dermatological conditions were associated with depression, affective disorders, suicide attempt and suicide ideation. Conclusion: Our results are the first to describe the prevalence of these disorders in Colombia. This is an exploratory study; nonetheless, it is of great value since it is the first to describe these associations in adolescents in a middle-income country, which should be considered during clinical examinations.

Additionally, the skin plays an important role in the psychodynamic development of children. The actual report is aimed at estimating the prevalence of dermatological conditions in children and describing the associations between skin and mental disorders in 7 to 11 years old children in Colombia. A secondary analysis of the data extracted from the National Mental Health Survey was carried out. This survey asked a national and regional representative sample of children aged 7 to 11 questions about mental disorder and skin problems. It was estimated that 19.9% (95%CI: [14.4,26.7] of all children presented dermatological issues. Significant differences were found between children who reside in rural areas and those whose home was located in the urban area (p=0.025). Among those with dermatitis, differences were found, revealing a larger proportion of children whose mothers consumed alcohol or psychoactive substances. Regarding mental health issues, a larger proportion of children with dermatitis presented mental disorders in the last 12 months (p=0.03), specifically anxiety disorders (p<0.001).

Methods: A non-experimental quantitative analysis was conducted. The sociodemographic data of DIADA [Detección y Atención Integral de Depresión y Abuso de Alcohol en Atención Primaria (Detection and Integrated Care for Depression and Alcohol Use in Primary Care)] study participants had been previously collected. At the time of the evaluation (September 12, 2019), only the participants who had been in the project for a minimum of three months were included. By using univariate (Chi-squared) analyses, we studied the association between participants’ sociodemographic profile and their rate of compliance with the first follow-up assessment at three months after study initiation. Results: At the date of the evaluation, 584 adult participants were identified, of which 389 had been involved in the project for more than three months. From the participants included, 320 performed the first follow-up, while 69 did not. The compliance rate to the first follow-up was 82.3% (CI 95% 78.1%-86%) and was not affected by: site location, age, sex, civil status, level of education, use of smartphone, PHQ9 score (measuring depression symptomatology) or AUDIT score (measuring harmful alcohol use). Participants who do not use a smartphone, from rural areas and with a lower socioeconomic status, tended to show higher compliance rates. Statistically significant associations were found; participants with lower job stability and a lack of access to the Internet showed higher compliance rates to the early initial follow-up assessment. Conclusions: The compliance rate was high and generally constant in spite of the variability of the sociodemographic profiles of the participants, although several sub-groups of participants showed particularly high rates of compliance. These findings may suggest that integrating mental health into primary care allows the structural and financial barriers that hinder access to health in Colombia to be broken down by raising awareness about mental illnesses, their high prevalence and the importance of timely and accessible medical management.",Article,"Cardenas Charry, Maria Paula.; Unknown.; Uribe, Jose Miguel.; Cepeda, Magda.; Unknown.; Cubillos, Leonardo.; Bartels, S.

However, evidence suggests that more than half of the young people with symptoms of depression and anxiety overcome their distress within a year. However, there is little research on the exact resources that young people use and help them to recover. The aim of this study was to explore how arts activities can support the recovery of young people engaged with arts organizations in Bogota. Methods: We recruited 38 participants from two arts organizations in Bogotá and conducted six focus groups embedded within artistic workshops. The type of activities in the workshops varied reflecting the different teaching methods of the two organizations. The focus group discussions were recorded and analyzed using thematic analysis. Results: Five themes explained how arts activities can help young people participating in artistic organizations to overcome mental distress: i) allowing the expression of emotions; ii) helping to manage and transform emotions; iii) distracting from problems; iv) facilitating social support and relationships; and v) contributing to the identity of young people. Conclusions: For young people who participate in artistic organizations, the arts are a resource for overcoming negative emotions such as anxiety, depression, and sadness. The beneficial role of arts activities includes different process of managing, expressing, and distracting from distress, and it differs depending on whether arts are perceived as a professional vocation or a hobby.",Article,"Gomez-Restrepo, Carlos.; Casasbuenas, Natalia Godoy.; Unknown.; Unknown.; Unknown.; Unknown.; Unknown.; Unknown.; Unknown",Adolescence;Anxiety;Art;COVID-19;Depression;Mental health;Resilience,Adolescence;Anxiety;Art;COVID-19;Depression;Mental health;Resilience,Colombia;Colombia;United Kingdom,

Drinking frequency, and level (moderate or heavy drinking) were used to assess alcohol use and depressive symptoms explored with the 15 items-GDS., using bivariate and multivariate adjusted regression models.Results: Lower weekly drinking frequency and a higher number of drinks per serving were associated with total GDS score. For individual symptoms, higher drinking frequency was associated with dropping activities and a preference to stay at home. Lower drinking frequency was associated with low mood, unhappiness, feelings of emptiness, worthlessness, hopelessness, and a lack of vigour. Lower number of drinks per serving was associated with withdrawal/apathy related symptoms; these also related to higher frequency of weekly alcohol consumption. Higher number of drinks per serving was associated with feelings of emptiness, worthlessness, boredom, help-lessness, worthlessness. not wanting to be alive, thinking that other people are better off in their mood, being afraid that something bad will happen and subjective memory problems.

Despite the existence of teleconsultation services in Colombia, few studies about it have been published. As a result of the health crisis caused by the COVID-19 pandemic, the Telepsychology care service was implemented in a university psychological care center. The goal of this study is to characterize the care experiences of the Telepsychology modality from the point of view of the consultants and students in their clinical practice. This with the purpose of enhancing the knowledge in this area and contributing to the evaluation of the viability of these services. A descriptive characterization study was carried out, with a cross-sectional design. The research team elaborated a questionnaire, that was answered by 253 consultants and 77 students. The information obtained evidenced that Telepsychology care achieved high levels of satisfaction with the treatment received, the possibility of establishing a therapeutic bond and the development of clinical skills in students. Therefore, this care modality was an alternative to remove boundaries to health care.

In order to approach this concept in a plain sanitas way, it was considered necessary to crosslink a component for the National Mental Health Survey 2015 (NMHS; ENSM for its acronym in Spanish), that would respond to the specific orientation and particularities of the country. Objective To describe the structure and contents of the mental health component of the NMHS 2015 for the Colombian population over 7 years of age. Methods Review, documentary analysis and discussion regarding the concepts and tools with the team in charge of the NMHS and other groups. Results 353 documents were reviewed, and 180 were analyzed and discussed. The component model is presented, considering the ethic dimension of relationship care as a main element; it merges two inquiry dimensions or categories: subjective-relational, and social-collective. Conclusions The structured mental health component provides information regarding the entire population. It also allows understanding and approaching the concept of mental health as a personal and collective “good life”.",Article,"Unknown.; Torres, Nubia.; Gomez-Restrepo, Carlos.; Matallana, Diana L.; Borda, Juan P.",Mental disorders;Mental health;Social capital,Mental disorders;Mental health;Social capital,Colombia;Colombia,

Early-successional species were more closely related than expected by chance, whereas late-successional species tended to be less closely related than expected by chance. Then, we evaluated temporal changes in the phylogenetic structure of seedling and tree assemblages in four 1-ha plots of secondary forests in this region. We found an increase in the phylogenetic evenness among tree individuals over time in all secondary tree assemblages, indicating that relatedness among tree individuals decreases as succession unfolds. This pattern was jointly promoted by recruitment and mortality processes, suggesting that increasing evenness was caused by the replacement of individuals of early-successional species from closely related lineages by late-successional species belonging to a wider diversity of lineages. Based on species occurrence, however, tree community reassembly did not show any significant phylogenetic trend over time. These results suggest that shifts in species abundance over succession have a greater impact on the phylogenetic structure of the community than the turnover of species. Seedling assemblages showed higher phylogenetic evenness than tree assemblages, suggesting that propagule colonization is an important process driving phylogenetic changes in species composition throughout succession. Overall, our findings showed that the phylogenetic structure of these successional communities varies at two temporal scales. At short timescales, decreased dominance by early-successional species over succession leads to increased evenness among tree individuals. At longer timescales, colonization processes result in increased phylogenetic evenness in seedling communities compared to tree communities, forecasting increasing phylogenetic evenness among adult individuals at late-successional stages.",Article,"Norden, N.; Letcher, S.G.; Boukili, V.; Swenson, N.G.; Chazdon, R.",community assembly; Costa Rica; life-history stages of plants; mortality; phylogenetic structure; recruitment; succession; vegetation dynamics,community assembly;Costa Rica;life-history stages of plants;mortality;phylogenetic structure;recruitment;succession;vegetation dynamics;TROPICAL SECONDARY FORESTS;NEOTROPICAL FOREST;SEEDLING COMMUNITIES;TREE COMMUNITIES;FUNCTIONAL TRAIT;NEUTRAL THEORY;WOOD DENSITY;RAIN-FORESTS;DIVERSITY;DYNAMICS,Colombia;United States;Costa Rica,2-s2.0-84859732960

Longitudinal analyses using data from the Hispanic Established Populations for the Epidemiologic Study of the Elderly (1995-96/2004-05). Five southwestern states: Texas, New Mexico, Colorado, Arizona, and California. Mexican Americans aged 67 and older with complete information on the frailty index and the Mini Mental State Examination (MMSE) (n=1,815). Cognitive impairment determined by a score in the MMSE < 21. Frailty defined as three or more of the following components: 1) weight-loss, 2) weakness, 3) self-reported exhaustion, 4) slow walking speed, and 5) low physical activity level. Sociodemographic characteristics and chronic medical conditions were used as covariates. Mortality was determined using the National Death Index or by proxy. As MMSE score declines over time, the percent of frail individuals increases in a linear fashion. Frailty and cognitive impairment are independent risk factors for mortality after controlling for all covariates (HR 2.03 95% CI 1.57-2.62; HR 1.26 95% CI 1.05-1.52, respectively). When both cognitive impairment and frailty were added to the model, HR for individuals with cognitive impairment was no longer statistically significant. The relation between frailty and cognitive impairment needs careful analysis in this population to establish pathways increasing mortality and decreasing quality of life.

However, relatively few studies have investigated the association between clinical and economic outcomes and malnutrition in hospitalized patients, particularly those with cardiac and pulmonary conditions. Methods: This multicenter prospective observational cohort study included 800 patients hospitalized at four Colombian hospitals with a diagnosis of congestive heart failure, acute myocardial infarction, community-acquired pneumonia, or chronic obstructive pulmonary disease. All patients were screened for malnutrition using the Malnutrition Screening Tool (MST). A descriptive analysis of baseline variables was followed by multivariate analysis and inverse probability weighting (IPW) to compare the clinical outcomes, i.e., length of stay (LOS), mortality, and readmission, and hospital costs associated with a positive MST result. Results: The prevalence of a positive MST result was 24.62% (n = 197) and was more common in patients with older age and greater comorbidities. Multivariate analysis controlling for age, gender, healthcare plan, university degree, hospitalization, entrance disease and Charison co-morbidity index showed that a positive MST result was associated with increased LOS (1.43 +/- 0.61 days) and both in-hospital mortality (odds ratio, 2.39) and global mortality (odds ratio, 2.52). IPW analysis confirmed the association between a positive MST result and increased hospital LOS and 30-day mortality, as well as a relative increase of 30.13% in the average cost associated with hospitalization. Conclusions: This study of hospital inpatients demonstrated a high burden of malnutrition at the time of hospital admission, which negatively impacted LOS and mortality and increased the costs of hospitalization. These findings underscore the need for improved diagnosis and treatment of hospital malnutrition to improve patient outcomes and reduce healthcare costs. (C) 2018 The Authors.

Accordingly, this study sought to use a systematic review of the scientific literature to ascertain the mortality of KPC- KP infection, and analyze such mortality by country, year of publication, hospital ward, and type of interpretation used to define carbapenem resistance. Methodology: A search without language restrictions was made of the MEDLINE, CENTRAL, EBSCO, LILACS and EMBASE databases from 1996 through June 2017, to locate all studies which had determined the existence of KPC- KP infection. We then performed a meta- analysis of all studies that reported KPC- KP infection- related mortality, and analyzedmortality by subgroup in accordance with standardmethodology. Results: A total of 51 papers were included in the systematic review. From 2005 through 2017, data on KPC- KP infection were reported in 5124 patients, with an average of 465 patients per year. The most widely studied type of infection was bacteremia (28.0%). The meta- analysis showed that overall mortality for the 37 studies was 41.0% (95%CI 37.0-44.0), with the highest mortality rates being observed in oncology patients, 56.0% (95%CI 38.1-73.0), and Brazil, 51.3% (95%CI 43.0-60.0). Conclusion: KPC- KP infection- related mortality is high, is manifested differently in some countries, and is highest among oncology patients. (C) 2018 The British Infection Association.

Mortality data from 2008 to 2012 in Mexico and California were analyzed and compared for causes of cancer death among adult and pediatric populations, using standard techniques and negative binomial regression. A total of 380,227 cancer deaths from Mexico and California were included. Mexican Americans had 49% and 13% higher mortality than their counterparts in Mexico among males and females, respectively. For Mexican Immigrants in the US, overall cancer mortality was similar to Mexico, their country of birth, but all-cancers-combined rates mask wide variation by specific cancer site.

These findings further reinforce the preeminent role that the environment, in its multiple aspects, has on cancer. Overall, mortality from obesity and tobacco-related cancers was higher among Mexican origin populations in the US compared to Mexico, suggesting a higher risk for these cancers, while mortality from prostate, stomach, and especially cervical and pediatric cancers was markedly higher in Mexico.

A systematic search, which identified 9,976 abstracts, led to the inclusion of 58 reviews. BC mortality reduction with screening mammography was 15-25% in trials and 28-56% in observational studies in all age groups, and the risk of stage III+ cancers was reduced for women older than 49 years. Overdiagnosis due to mammography was 1-60% in trials and 1-12% in studies with a low risk of bias, and cumulative false-positive rates were lower with biennial than annual screening (3-17% vs 0.01-41%). There is no consistency in the reviews' conclusions about the magnitude of BC mortality reduction among women younger than 50 years or older than 69 years, or determinants of benefits and harms of mammography, including the type of mammography (digital vs screen-film), the number of views and the screening interval. Similarly, there was no solid evidence on determinants of benefits and harms or BC mortality reduction with screening by ultrasonography or clinical breast examination (sensitivity ranges, 54-84% and 47-69%, respectively), and strong evidence of unfavourable benefit-to-harm ratio with breast self-examination.

,,,25,WOS:000208835900016,2012,IDEA Study (International Day for the Evaluation of Abdominal Obesity): Primary care study of the prevalence of abdominal obesity and associated risk factors in Colombia,"Introduction. Obesity is frequently associated with risk factors for cardiovascular and metabolic diseases. Central obesity is a marker of increased intra-abdominal adiposity and a known risk factor for atherosclerosis and diabetes; it is also a good predictor of risk for coronary events, cardiovascular mortality, diabetes and metabolic syndrome. A less predictive alternate measurement is known as the body mass index (BMI). Objective. Obesity prevalence was estimated first by BMI and then by abdominal obesity (measured by waist circumference, WC) in primary care patients. Materials and methods. As part of an international study, primary care physicians recruited consecutive patients aged 18 to 80 years who consulted for any reason on two pre-specified half-days. Age, gender, smoking status and history of cardiovascular disease or diabetes were recorded. Height, weight and WC were measured using standard methods. Pregnant women and subjects unwilling to participate were excluded. Results. A total of 3,795 patients from 105 primary care centers located throughout Colombia were evaluated. The mean age was 45 years (69% females). Of these, 60.7% of males and 53.9% of females were overweight or obese according to their BMI; 24.6% of males and 44.6% of females had abdominal obesity when National Cholesterol Education Program guidelines were used, but numbers changed to 62.5% and 67.0% when the International Diabetes Federation guidelines were used. Obesity, either determined by BMI or by WC, was associated with higher prevalence of diabetes, hypertension and dyslipidemia. Conclusions. Increased waist circumference is a practical and useful marker for cardiovascular and metabolic conditions.

The aim of this study was to identify the pre-operative factors associated with increased mortality in elderly patients with hip fractures in a developing country during the first postoperative year. Methods: An ambidirectional cohort study was conducted with patients >= 65 years of age who underwent hip surgery due to a hip fracture caused by a fall from a standing position. Socio-demographic data, time to surgery, and comorbidities measured by the Charlson Comorbidity Index (CCI) were recorded. One-year mortality from all causes was the primary outcome, and 30-day and 6-month mortality were the secondary outcomes. Log-rank test was used to evaluate survival, and Cox's proportional hazard regression was used to detect the factors associated with increased mortality. Results: 478 patients who underwent hip surgery were included in this study. The mean age was 80.2 +/- 9.9, and 297 (62%) were females. There were 150 (31.4%) deaths at the end of the first follow-up year, and the mean of surgical delay was 8.8 days +/- 6.4. Patients who underwent surgery during the first 4 days (Log-rank test < 0.001) after hip fracture occurred and patients with a CCI <= 2 (Log-rank test < 0.001) showed better survival (90%), comparing to mortality (52%) of patients with a CCI >= 3 and surgical delay > 4 days.

Methods: Twenty-five hospital-and population-based surveillance programs in 19 International Clearinghouse for Birth Defects Surveillance and Research member countries provided birth defects mortality data between 1974 and 2015. CDH cases included live births, stillbirths, or elective termination of pregnancy for fetal anomalies. Prevalence, cumulative mortality rates, and 95% confidence intervals (CIs) were calculated using Poisson regression and a Kaplan-Meier product-limit method. Joinpoint regression analyses were conducted to assess time trends.& nbsp; Results: The prevalence of CDH was 2.6 per 10,000 total births (95% CI: 2.5-2.7), slightly increasing between 2001 and 2012 (average annual percent change = 0.5%; 95% CI:-0.6 to 1.6). The total percent mortality of CDH was 37.7%, with hospital-based registries having more deaths among live births than population-based registries (45.1% vs. 33.8%). Mortality rates decreased over time (average annual percent change =-2.4%; 95% CI:-3.8 to 1.1). Most deaths due to CDH occurred among 2-to 6-day-old infants for both registry types (36.3%, hospital-based; 12.1%, population-based).& nbsp; Conclusions: The mortality of CDH has decreased over time.

A secondary objective was to assess predisposing factors to IHT development. We conducted a systematic literature search of major electronic databases (MEDLINE, EMBASE, and Cochrane Library), for studies that assessed intracranial pressure (ICP) monitoring in patients with acute ICH. Study level and outcome measures were extracted. The meta-analysis was performed using a random-effects model. A total of six studies comprising 381 patients were pooled to estimate the overall prevalence of any episode of IHT (ICP>20mmHg) after ICH. The pooled prevalence rate for any episode of IHT after ICH was 67% (95% CI 51-84%). Four studies comprising 239 patients were pooled in order to estimate the overall mortality rate associated with IHT. Pooled mortality rate was 50% (95% CI 24-76%). For both outcomes, heterogeneity was statistically significant, and risk of bias was nonsignificant. Reported variables correlated significantly with increased ICP were lower Glasgow Coma Scale score at admission, midline shift, hemorrhage volume, and hydrocephalus. The prevalence and mortality rates associated with IHT after ICH are high and may be underestimated. Predicting factors for the development of IHT reflect the magnitude of the primary injury. However, the results of present meta-analysis should be interpreted with caution due to methodological limitations such as selection bias of patients who had ICP monitoring, and lack of standardized IHT definition.",Review,"Godoy, D.A.; Nunez-Patino, R.A.; Zorrilla-Vaca, A.; Ziai, W.C.; Hemphill, J.C.",Intracerebral hemorrhage; Intracranial hypertension; Intracranial pressure; Meta-analysis; Prevalence; Mortality,Intracerebral hemorrhage;Intracranial hypertension;Intracranial pressure;Meta-analysis;Prevalence;Mortality;NOT-RESUSCITATE ORDERS;COMATOSE PATIENTS;SURGICAL-MANAGEMENT;PRESSURE;GUIDELINES;HEMATOMAS;ICP,Argentina;Colombia;United States,2-s2.0-85058964545

Our aim was to determine the usefulness of serum lactate as a prognostic factor of 28-day mortality in patients admitted to the Emergency Department with clinical diagnosis of sepsis without septic shock. Patients and methods: We performed a secondary analysis of the study The epidemiology of sepsis in Colombia, a prospective cohort of patients from 10 general hospitals in 4 Colombian cities. We analyzed patients without hypotension with serum lactate available and admitted with community-acquired infections, which were confirmed according to the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention CDC criteria. A logistical regression was performed adjusting for age, sex, comorbidities and severity scores. Results: We included 961 patients aged 57.2 +/- 21.0 years, 54.2% were females, mean SOFA score was 3.0 +/- 2.3 and APACHE score was 11.1 +/- 6.4. We observed a linear relationship between serum lactate and the odds of death, and after adjustment there was a significant and independent association between lactate and mortality (odds ratio 1,16, 95% confidence interval 1.02-1.33). Conclusion: Serum lactate is independently and significantly associated with 28-day mortality among patients with infection who present to the Emergency Department without hypotension. Besides, mortality increases in a linear way with serum lactate from any detectable value. (C) 2012 Elsevier Esparia, S.L.

The aim of this study was to identify predictive factors for conversion and to evaluate morbidity, mortality and hospital stay. Methods: A prospective cohort of patients admitted to the emergency department with acute cholecystitis. We evaluated the statistical significance of the demographic, clinical, biochemical, imaging and surgical factors at admission, associated with conversion to open surgery using a univariate model. The associated factors evaluated during initial analysis were then included in a multivariate analysis. Finally a comparative analysis was made of the morbidity and mortality in both models. Results: A total of 703 patients were included. Conversion rate was 13.8%. Univariate analysis identified as factors: male gender, previous ERCP, leucocytes > 12,000 mm(3), age > 70 years, hypertension, jaundice, cholangitis, total bilirubin > 2 mg/dl, ASA III-IV, gallbladder wall enlargement and choledocholithiasis. Logistic regression identified as predictive factors: previous ERCP, leucocytes, age > 70 years and male gender. Converted patients had a higher morbidity rate, further operations and longer hospital stays (P < .001). No difference was seen in mortality. Discussion: It is important to recognise patients with a higher risk of conversion in order to optimise planning and performing of the surgical procedure, and to decrease the morbidity associated with laparotomy, given that the independent factors identified are not modifiable.

Materials and methods: A multicenter matched case-control study was conducted in 7 intensive care units of 3 university hospitals. Data on overall length of hospital stay (including both general wards and the intensive care unit) were recorded. Results: A total of 243 subjects (81 cases and 162 controls) between January 2008 and December 2012 were included. In order of frequency, C. albicans, C. tropicalis and C. parapsilosis were isolated. The main identified risk factors were: overall length of hospital stay > 25 days (OR 5.33, 95% CI 2.6-10.9), use of meropenem (OR 3.75, 95% CI 1.86-7.5), abdominal surgery (OR 2.9, 95% CI 1.39-6.06) and hemodialysis (OR 3.35, 95% CI 1.5-7.7). No differences in mortality between patients with candidemia and controls were found (39.5 vs. 36.5%, respectively, P=.66) were found. Conclusions: In Colombia, a long hospital stay, abdominal surgery, the use of meropenem and hemodialysis were identified as risk factors for candidemia. (C) 2015 Elsevier Espana, S.L.U. and SEMICYUC.

Although anthropometry has been widely used as a way to stratify the overall mortality risk of a person, the significance of these measurements becomes blurred in the case of frail older adults who have changes in body composition. Therefore, the aim of this study is to determine the association of anthropometric measurements (body mass index, knee-adjusted height body mass index, waist-to-hip ratio and calf circumference) with mortality risk in a group of older Mexican adults. Methods: This is a longitudinal analysis of the Mexican Health and Aging sub-sample (with biomarkers, n = 2573) from the first wave in 2001, followed-up to the last available wave in 2015. Only frail 50-year or older adults (Frailty Index with a cut-off value of 0.21 or higher, was used) were considered for this analysis (n = 1298). A survival analysis was performed with Kaplan-Meier curves and Cox regression models (unadjusted and adjusted for confounding). Socio-demographic, health risks, physical activity and comorbidities were variables used for adjusting the multivariate models. Results: From the total sample of 1298 older adults, 32.5% (n = 422) died during follow-up. The highest hazard ratio in the adjusted model was for calf circumference 1.31 (95% confidence interval 1.02-1.69, p = 0.034). Other measurements were not significant. Conclusions: Anthropometric measurements have different significance in frail older adults, and these differences could have implications on adverse outcomes.

To study the inequalities in various mortality indicators for the departments of Colombia with respect to national figures, and to identify associations between the departmental mortality indicators and departmental socioeconomic indicators. Methods. To determine mortality rates and the Gini coefficient for mortality for the departments, data from the death registry were adjusted by the estimated registry coverage for each of the departments. Five socioeconomic indicators were selected: Gini coefficient for income distribution, Human Development Index, per capita gross domestic product, per capita social investment ( in health care, etc.), and percentage of the population with health care services from the country's social security system. The differences among the departments were then studied and compared to the national averages. The Spearman's rank correlation coefficient was calculated to find associations between the mortality indicators and each of the five socioeconomic indicators. Results. For Colombia overall, death registry coverage was estimated at 76%, with Choco department having the lowest coverage ( 35%), and Caldas department the highest ( 88%). The associations between the Gini coefficient for mortality and four of the socioeconomic indicators studied were significant. The national mortality rate was significantly associated with one socioeconomic indicator. Death caused by diabetes mellitus was associated with all the socioeconomic indicators; death caused by undernutrition or by diarrhea, with four socioeconomic indicators; and death from traffic accidents, with two socioeconomic indicators. Homicide was not associated with any of the socioeconomic indicators studied. Conclusions. Adjusting the death registry data produced mortality indicators that were more valid for drawing associations with socioeconomic indicators. The Gini coefficient of mortality, mortality from undernutrition, and mortality from diarrheal diseases were more suitable indicators for evaluating the inequalities among the departments because of their higher levels of association with the socioeconomic indicators. Regarding diabetes- related mortality, the associations with all the socioeconomic indicators could be due to systematic errors that lesser- developed departments made when the cause of death was being assigned. A department is a large unit for analysis, which can make it difficult to identify associations between socioeconomic indicators and deaths due to homicide or traffic accidents.",Article,"Garcia, J.R.",health status indicators; mortality; life tables; socioeconomic factors; population characteristics; Colombia,"health status indicators;mortality;life tables;socioeconomic factors;population characteristics;Colombia;INCOME INEQUALITY;HEALTH;FARR,WILLIAM;DEPRIVATION;PATTERNS",Colombia,2-s2.0-34249900983

Objectives To examine stillbirth and infant and child mortality among those affected by spina bifida using data from multiple countries. Methods We conducted an observational study, using data from 24 population- and hospital-based surveillance registries in 18 countries contributing as members of the International Clearinghouse for Birth Defects Surveillance and Research (ICBDSR). Cases of spina bifida that resulted in livebirths or stillbirths from 20 weeks' gestation or elective termination of pregnancy for fetal anomaly (ETOPFA) were included. Among liveborn spina bifida cases, we calculated mortality at different ages as number of deaths among liveborn cases divided by total number of liveborn cases with spina bifida. As a secondary outcome measure, we estimated the prevalence of spina bifida per 10 000 total births. The 95% confidence interval for the prevalence estimate was estimated using the Poisson approximation of binomial distribution. Results Between years 2001 and 2012, the overall first-week mortality proportion was 6.9% (95% CI 6.3, 7.7) and was lower in programmes operating in countries with policies that allowed ETOPFA compared with their counterparts (5.9% vs. 8.4%). The majority of first-week mortality occurred on the first day of life. In programmes where information on long-term mortality was available through linkage to administrative databases, survival at 5 years of age was 90%-96% in Europe, and 86%-96% in North America. Conclusions Our multi-country study showed a high proportion of stillbirth and infant and child deaths among those with spina bifida.

Disability adjusted life years (DALYs) have been developed to compare the burden of this disease both between conditions and between geographical boundaries. With improving data on disease incidence and prevalence in Colombia, we can refine our DALYs-based estimates. Methods: Using different strategies, including the official healthcare provision database and death certificates, as well as extrapolation from published neuroepidemiologic studies, we estimated the incidence and prevalence by age groups, disease duration and attributable mortality. With this information we calculated DALYs for the year 2012. Results: Overall, it was found that epilepsy was responsible for 0.88% of all deaths in Colombia. A total of 5.25 DALYs per 1,000 person-years are lost due to epilepsy in Colombia, 75% of which (3.91 DALYs) are due to premature mortality, with a higher burden in men (6.12 DALYs) than in women (4.41 DALYs). Conclusions: We reported new estimations on epilepsy incidence and prevalence by age groups in Colombia and conclude that DALYs lost due to epilepsy in Colombia are almost double the previous figure, mostly because of the underestimation of attributable mortality. With this figure, epilepsy ranks 12th instead of 19th in the list of the most important causes of DALYs lost. (C) 2015 S.

We exploit regional variations in gross domestic product per capita (GDPpc) over the period 1980-2010 in Colombia to examine how changes in economic output relate to adult mortality. Methods: Data on the number of annual deaths at ages 20 years and older (n = 3,506,600) from mortality registries, disaggregated by age groups, sex and region, were linked to population counts for the period 1980-2010. We used region fixed effect models to examine whether changes in regional GDPpc were associated with changes in mortality. We carried out separate analyses for the periods 1980-1995 and 2000-2010 as well as by sex, distinguishing three age groups: 20-44 (predominantly young working adults), 45-64 (middle aged working adults), and 65+ (senior, predominantly retired individuals). Results: The association between regional economic conditions and mortality varied by period and age groups. From 1980 to 1995, increases in GDPpc were unrelated to mortality at ages 20 to 64, but they were associated with reductions in mortality for senior men. In contrast, from 2000 to 2010, changes in GDPpc were not associated with old age mortality, while an increase in GDPpc was associated with a decline in mortality at ages 20-44 years. Analyses restricted to regions with high registration coverage yielded similar albeit less precise estimates for most sub-groups. Conclusions: The relationship between business cycles and mortality varied by period and age in Colombia. Most notably, mortality shifted from being acyclical to being countercyclical for males aged 20-44, while it shifted from being countercyclical to being acyclical for males aged 65+.",Article,"Arroyave, I.; Hessel, P.; Burdorf, A.; Rodriguez-Garcia, J.; Cardona, D.; Avendano, M.",Mortality; Economic recession; Colombia; Developing countries; Health insurance,Mortality;Economic recession;Colombia;Developing countries;Health insurance;RECESSIONS GOOD;CYCLICALITY;INSURANCE;TIMES,Netherlands;Colombia;United Kingdom;United States,2-s2.0-84935037376

We incorporated the variation associated with the ranking of institutions simulating its random effects under a binomial distribution. Methods: A nationwide survey on structure, technology, and staffing resources available in Colombian intensive care units during 1997-1998 was conducted. We collected data on admissions from 20 randomly selected adult medical and surgical intensive care units. Results: The mortality ratio from the 20 intensive care units ranged from 0.59 to 2.36; 80% of the intensive care units had a mortality ratio greater than 1. All four intensive care units with the lowest mortality ratio belonged to private institutions, while four of five institutions with the highest mortality belonged to the public sector. Intensive care units in private institutions also had fewer number of beds, lower median length of stay, lower occupancy rates, higher education training for specialists and nurses and fewer emergency nonelective surgical procedures. Conclusion: We successfully accounted for intensive care mortality baseline differences and random effects variations. There were substantial differences between intensive care units in institution type, bed availability, technology, staffing resources, and degree of training, which may have been associated with patient outcome. These results are of crucial importance to track, detect and assess future changes. (c) 2006 Elsevier Inc.

However, there is a lack of knowledge about the prevalence and the impact of nutritional risk on outcomes in Colombia. The aim of the present study was to determine the prevalence of nutritional risk, to know how nutrition screening is routinely performed and to determine the impact of nutritional risk on the outcomes of in-hospital mortality and being discharged home outcomes. Methods: We conducted a descriptive analysis of selected data from 7 consecutive, annual, and crosssectional nutritionDay samples (2009-2015) including a total of 7,994 adult patients in 248 units in Colombia. Data is contrasted with the Latin American and worldwide results. The prevalence of nutritional risk was determined according to the malnutrition screening tool (MST). The impact of nutritional risk in Colombian patients regarding outcomes was assessed by a Fine and Gray competing risk regression model controlling for PANDORA score (age, BMI, length of stay before nutritionDay, cancer diagnosis, and mobility). Results: The prevalence of nutritional risk (MST score >= 2) in Colombia was 38%, 41% in Latin America, and 32% worldwide. Half of the Colombian units screened patients for malnutrition or nutritional risk on admission to hospital, compared to 80% in Latin America and 62% worldwide. Only 23% of the Colombian patients identified as being at nutritional risk in the nutritionDay survey received any nutritional therapy. The hospital mortality hazard ratio of Colombian patients at nutritional risk defined by MST was 1.94 (95% CI, 1.53,2.46; p < 0.001) and 0.82 of being discharged home (95% CI, 0.76,0.88, p < 0.001). Conclusions: This is the first large-scale study in Colombia evaluating the impact of nutritional risk on clinical outcomes showing an increase of in-hospital mortality and a reduction of being discharged home. Moreover, the study shows that nutritional risk is still highly prevalent worldwide implying the need to promote an optimal nutritional care. The participation of Latin American countries in the nutritionDay survey is an opportunity to increase knowledge and awareness of these issues.

The aim of the present study was to determine the impact, in terms of efficacy and safety, of previous maintenance treatment on severe asthma exacerbations. Patients and Methods: We retrospectively evaluated the clinical characteristics of exacerbations experienced by 1543 patients with moderate persistent and severe persistent asthma. Drug therapy was as follows: a combination of inhaled LABAs and corticosteroids (493 patients), an inhaled corticosteroid only (456 patients), and no maintenance treatment (594 patients). Results: Asthmatic patients taking LABAs did not show higher mortality, longer stay in the intensive care unit, longer hospital stay, lower pH, or worse airflow obstruction than the other 2 groups. On the contrary, they had a higher mean (SD) forced expiratory volume in 1 second at discharge (54% [16%]) than patients taking inhaled corticosteroids (48% [19%]) and patients taking no maintenance treatment (48% [20%]) (P=.009). Patients taking no maintenance treatment also had lower mean (SD) pH values (7.37 [0.11]) than patients taking LABAs (7.39 [0.09]) and patients taking inhaled corticosteroids (7.39 [0.08]) (P=.002), and more admissions to the intensive care unit (11.1% vs 6.5% and 7.7%: P=.002 and P=.018, respectively). Conclusions: This study did not reveal higher morbidity or mortality in severe asthma exacerbations in patients with moderate persistent or severe persistent asthma who had received inhaled LABAs combined with inhaled corticosteroids. On, the contrary, asthma patients who did not use maintenance treatment experienced more severe asthma exacerbations. (C) 2009 SEPAR. Published by Elsevier Espana, S.L.

The objective of this study was to determine omphalocele prevalence, time trends, and mortality during early childhood, by geographical region, and the presence of associated anomalies. Methods We conducted a retrospective study with 23 birth defect surveillance systems in 18 countries who are members of the International Clearinghouse for Birth Defects Surveillance and Research that submitted data on cases ascertained from 2000 through 2012, approximately 16 million pregnancies were surveyed that resulted in live births, stillbirths, or elective terminations of pregnancy for fetal anomalies (ETOPFA) and cases with omphalocele were included. Overall prevalence and mortality rates for specific ages were calculated (day of birth, neonatal, infant, and early childhood). We used Kaplan-Meier estimates with 95% confidence intervals (CI) to calculate cumulative mortality and joinpoint regression for time trend analyses. Results The prevalence of omphalocele was 2.6 per 10,000 births (95% CI: 2.5, 2.7) and showed no temporal change from 2000-2012 (average annual percent change = -0.19%,p= .52). The overall mortality rate was 32.1% (95% CI: 30.2, 34.0). Most deaths occurred during the neonatal period and among children with multiple anomalies or syndromic omphalocele. Prevalence and mortality varied by registry type (e.g., hospital- vs. population-based) and inclusion or exclusion of ETOPFA. Conclusions The prevalence of omphalocele showed no temporal change from 2000-2012.

Methods: A survival analysis was performed on data from patients with invasive stomach cancer (SC), breast cancer (BC), cervical cancer (CC), and colorectal cancer (CRC) treated in the INC in the year 2012. Data were taken from the hospital cancer register and the deaths register from the INC and government sources. Frequencies and measures of central tendency and dispersion were calculated. The overall survival at two years from the date of admission was estimated using Kaplan-Meier methods and was compared using the Log-rank Test. Results: A total of 1,793 cancer cases were analysed. The estimated survival at two years for the 2012 cohort was 29.4% (95% CI 24.9 -33.9) for SC; 80.8% (95% CI: 77.9 -83.7) for BC; 62.3% (95% CI: 57.0 -67.6) for CC, and 54.1% (95% CI 49.0 -59.2) for CRC. The median survival time could only be determined for SC, and was 9.6 months. Conclusions: Two year survival at INC was highest for BC, and very low for SC, and were within expectations compared to the literature. These data provide a reference on the prognosis for these cancers in Colombia, and as a baseline for monitoring overall cancer survival. The trends in survival over time may indicate advances in care. (C) 2017 Institut Nacional de Cancerologia. Published by Elsevier Espana, S.L.U.

Worldwide, 20-25% of adults have hypertension, with 70% of them living in developing countries. Hypertensive renal disease (HRD) is a complication of insufficiently controlled hypertension. This study aims to analyze the behavior of HRD mortality in Mexico between 1998 and 2009. Methods: Longitudinal study with secondary analysis of HRD records from the databases provided by INEGI, which analyzes the specific rates by age and sex and standardized mortality ratio (SMR) by states and regions. Georeferencing methods are used statewide. Results: In Mexico from 1998 to 2009 there were 48,823 deaths from HRD. The standardized mortality rate rose from 3.35/100,000 inhabitants to 6.74 (p < 0.01). The specific rates by age and sex showed an increase in incidence after 50 years of age. States with higher SMR by HDR were DF, Estado de Mexico, Morelos, Jalisco, and Colima. Conclusions: HRD is a major microvascular complication of hypertension and its prevalence is increasing. We should strengthen the processes of early detection, care, and appropriate follow-up of people with hypertension to control this potentially preventable complication.",Article,"Hernandez, J.M.R.; Najera, R.G.; Hernandez, C.A.",Chronic kidney disease; Hypertension; Chronic diseases; Mortality; Mexico,Chronic kidney disease;Hypertension;Chronic diseases;Mortality;Mexico;ESSENTIAL-HYPERTENSION;KIDNEY-DISEASE;PREVENTION,Colombia;Mexico,2-s2.0-84880225934

Methods: Using Colombian national mortality statistics, we calculated age-standardized mortality rates (ASMR) as well as age-specific rates per 100,000 person-years, applying redistribution factors according to international recommendations. We imputed missing data for educational level. Multivariate Poisson regression models were constructed to incorporate age and educational level as independent variables. To assess changes in educational inequalities, we estimated the Relative Index of Inequality (RII). All estimates were also evaluated over time, resulting in estimated annual percent changes (EAPC). Results: Over time, cervical cancer mortality declined rapidly up to 2013 (EAPC = - 5.4%, ASMR 27.2 in 1998, 12.5 in 2013), after which ASMR stabilized. This pattern was present in all but the youngest age group and in all educational levels, but much stronger initial declines were observed among women with tertiary education (EAPC = - 8.3%) compared with those with primary (EAPC = - 4.0%) and secondary (EAPC = - 3.4%) educational levels. The overall RII was 6.77 (95%CI: 6.15, 7.47), varying from 3.5 for women aged 65 and over, to 8.5 in women aged 25-44. Significant increases in inequality were observed for middle-aged (EAPC = + 2.9%) and young (EAPC = + 2.4%). Conclusion: Cervical cancer mortality rates were highest at older ages, but inequalities are concentrated in the younger age groups - and increasing. Considering the recent stagnations in improvement in cervical cancer mortality as well as it inequalities, public policies addressed to reduce cervical cancer mortality are recently failing.",Article,"de Vries, E.; Arroyave, I.; Pardo, C.",Cervical cancer; Mortality; Trends; Inequalities; Education; Colombia,Cervical cancer;Mortality;Trends;Inequalities;Education;Colombia;DISPARITIES;ACCESS;WOMEN,Colombia,2-s2.0-85044678549

Methodology Analytical cohort study of patients with cancer and COVID-19 infection in Colombia. From April 1 to October 31, 2020. Demographic and clinical variables related to cancer and COVID-19 infection were collected. The primary outcome was 30-day mortality from all causes. The association between the outcome and the prognostic variables was analyzed using logistic regression models and survival analysis with Cox regression. Results The study included 742 patients; 72% were >51 years. The most prevalent neoplasms were breast (132, 17.77%), colorectal (92, 12.34%), and prostate (81, 10.9%). Two hundred twenty (29.6%) patients were asymptomatic and 96 (26.3%) died. In the bivariate descriptive analysis, higher mortality occurred in patients who were >70 years, patients with lung cancer, >= 2 comorbidities, former smokers, receiving antibiotics, corticosteroids, and anticoagulants, residents of rural areas, low socioeconomic status, and increased acute-phase reactants. In the logistic regression analysis, higher mortality was associated with Eastern Cooperative Oncology Group performance status (ECOG PS) 3 (odds ratio [OR] 28.67; 95% confidence interval [CI], 8.2-99.6); ECOG PS 4 (OR 20.89; 95% CI, 3.36-129.7); two complications from COVID-19 (OR 5.3; 95% CI, 1.50-18.1); and cancer in progression (OR 2.08; 95% CI, 1.01-4.27). In the Cox regression analysis, the statistically significant hazard ratios (HR) were metastatic disease (HR 1.58; 95% CI, 1.16-2.16), cancer in progression (HR 1.08; 95% CI, 1.24-2.61) cancer in partial response (HR 0.31; 95% CI, 0.11-0.88), use of steroids (HR 1.44; 95% CI, 1.01-2.06), and use of antibiotics (HR 2.11; 95% CI, 1.47-2.95). Conclusion In our study, patients with cancer have higher mortality due to COVID-19 infection if they have active cancer, metastatic or progressive cancer, ECOG PS >2, and low socioeconomic status. Implications for Practice This study's findings raise the need to carefully evaluate patients with metastatic cancer, in progression, and with impaired Eastern Cooperative Oncology Group status to define the relevance of cancer treatment during the pandemic, consider the risk/benefit of the interventions, and establish clear and complete communication with the patients and their families about the risk of complications.

To assess mortality in patients with potentially severe injuries and explore the correlation between mortality and the score on the GAP scale (Glasgow Coma Scale, age, and systolic blood pressure). Methods. Retrospective observational study of all patients with potentially severe injuries treated in an emergency department (ED) over a period of 15 months. We recorded epidemiologic variables, cause of injury, type of transport, need for prehospital orotracheal intubation, substance abuse, Charlson Comorbidity Index (CCI), variables for the GAP prognostic score, destination on discharge from the ED and at the end of the episode, and mortality. Results. Data for 864 patients entered the final analysis.

In Colombia, congenital malformations are the second leading cause of infant mortality. Objective: To determine the geographical distribution of extended perinatal mortality due to congenital malformations in Colombia between 1999 and 2008. Materials and methods: We conducted a cross-sectional study. We revised all death certificates issued between 1999 and 2008. We defined perinatal mortality as fetal or non-fetal deaths within the first 28 days after delivery in children with body weight >= 500 grams, and congenital malformations according to ICD-10 diagnostic codes Q000 - Q999. The annual birth projection was used as the denominator. We defined high mortality areas due to congenital malformations as those in the 90th percentile. Results: We recorded 22,361 perinatal deaths due to congenital malformations. The following provinces exceeded the 90th perinatal mortality percentile: Antioquia, Caldas, Risaralda, Huila, Quindio, Bogota, Valle del Cauca and Guainla. Among the municipalities, the highest perinatal mortality rates were found in Giraldo, Ciudad Bolivar, Riosucio, Liborina, Supia, Alejandria, Sopetran, San Jeronimo, Santa Fe de Antioquia and Marmato (205.81 and 74.18 per 10.000 live births). The perinatal mortality rate due to malformations of the circulatory system was 28.1 per 10.000 live births, whereas the rates for central nervous system defects and chromosomal abnormalities were 13.7 and 7.0, respectively.

Infants born with this condition require surgical correction soon after birth. Most survival studies of infants with EA are locally or regionally based. We aimed to describe survival across multiple world regions. Methods We included infants diagnosed with EA between 1980 and 2015 from 24 birth defects surveillance programs that are members of the International Clearinghouse for Birth Defects Surveillance and Research. We calculated survival as the proportion of liveborn infants alive at 1 month, 1- and 5-years, among all infants with EA, those with isolated EA, those with EA and additional anomalies or EA and a chromosomal anomaly or genetic syndrome. We also investigated trends in survival over the decades, 1980s-2010s. Results We included 6,466 liveborn infants with EA. Survival was 89.4% (95% CI 88.1-90.5) at 1-month, 84.5% (95% CI 83.0-85.9) at 1-year and 82.7% (95% CI 81.2-84.2) at 5-years. One-month survival for infants with isolated EA (97.1%) was higher than for infants with additional anomalies (89.7%) or infants with chromosomal or genetic syndrome diagnoses (57.3%) with little change at 1- and 5-years. Survival at 1 month improved from the 1980s to the 2010s, by 6.5% for infants with isolated EA and by 21.5% for infants with EA and additional anomalies.

The articles were classified into three categories: mortality and theoretical articles, inequalities in morbidity and self-perception of health condition, and access to health services. We carried out a critical analysis of mortality articles between the years 2007 and 2014, the period with the highest proportion of academic production. More research articles were found in Brazil, Colombia, and Mexico, especially in universities with emerging collaboration networks. The most used methodologies were theoretical reviews, ecological and cross-section studies, and a prevailing use of the model of social determinants of health of the WHO. The categories used were: social class, economic position, gender, ethnicity/race, and geographical unit.

Review of the literature,"OBJECTIVE: Testicular cancer (TC) is the most common cancer in men between 15 and 44 years. It has been reported that the incidence of TC is rising. The aim of this article is to determine the epidemiology of TC in Colombia. METHODS: A literature review on four databases was performed PubMed, Embase, Lilacs and Scielo. Studies of incidence, prevalence, mortality and survival of TC were taken from different countries. Studies included were published in the last 10 years. RESULTS: 2308 references were reviewed by title and abstract. In search of local references in non-indexedjournals 5 references were extracted. In total 139 references for review in full text were selected. The global incidence and prevalence of cancer varies. In the Northern Europe region, the highest incidence is evident, mainly in Denmark, Croatia and Norway. Followed by Western Europe and South America with Chile. In Colombia the general age incidence is 2,2/100.000, finding a zero incidence in departments such as Choco and Guajira. CONCLUSIONS: A rise in the incidence of TC has been seen globally, this trend mainly in developing countries. In Colombia most studies are crossectional studies.

The databases of deaths by suicide and population projections of DANE were used. A longitudinal and analytical study was conducted. From 2000 to 2013, annual trends of deaths by suicide by means of modeling of covariables were established and risk estimates were collected. The Poisson regression model (PRM) was used. IRR was used according to the MRP with a level of significance of (P < 0.05). Colombians between the years 2000-2013, male, 15 to 34 years old, from the Central and Eastern regions and from the Departments of Vaupes, Huila and Quindio were those with the highest risk of death by suicide. The suicide rate decreased slightly as the years went by. The highest risk of suicide occurred among men of productive age, older adults, and in underdeveloped regions.

However it is not clear if they are best option for patients with statin related intolerance or what their adverse effects are. The bile acid sequestrants are an interesting alternative, however its evidence has not been carefully evaluated. Methods A search was conducted on MEDLINE, Embase and Cochrane library databases for articles published up to June 2013, limited to Spanish and English language. Randomized clinical trials (RCT) and cohort studies evaluating the impact of bile acid sequestrants on mortality, cardiovascular outcomes, seric lipids and adverse effects were selected. Information was presented in a descriptive way. Results Four RCT and one cohort study with aggregate data on 6833 people were included. Just one study evaluated cardiovascular mortality showing no statistically significant difference when compared with placebo, (RR 0.76; 95% CI 0.5:1.15), however there was a 16% reduction on acute myocardial infarction incidence. (RR 0.84; 95% IC 0.67: 1.00). Three studies evaluated seric lipids changes showing a moderate reduction in LDL levels without clinical significant differences on HDL and triglyceride levels.

A significant number of studies have compared the mortality of patients who require RRT versus those who do not require it, finding an increase in mortality rates in the short and medium term; however, few studies have evaluated the long-term survival in a mixture of patients admitted to the ICU. Objective To evaluate the impact of RRT on 5-year survival in patients with AKI admitted to the ICU Methods Using administrative databases of insurers of the Colombian health system, a cohort of patients admitted to the ICU between 1 January 2012 and 31 December 2013 was followed until 31 December 2018. ICD-10 diagnoses, procedure codes, and prescribed medications were used to establish the frequencies of the comorbidities included in the Charlson index. Patients were followed for at least 5 years to evaluate survival and establish the adjusted risks by propensity score matching. Results Of the 150,230 patients admitted to the ICU, 4366 (2.9%) required RRT in the ICU. Mortality rates for patients with RRT vs no RRT evaluated at ICU discharge, 1 year, and 5 years were 35%, 57.4%, and 67.9% vs 7.4%, 17.6%, and 30.1%, respectively. After propensity score matching, the hazard ratio was calculated for patients who received RRT and those who did not (HR, 2.46; 95% CI 2.37 to 2.56;p< 0.001), with a lower difference in years of survival for patients with RRT (mean effect in the treated) of - 1.86 (95% CI - 2.01 to to1.65;p< 0.001).

Colombia recognized orphan diseases as a problem of public health interest and ordered its mandatory notification. Objective: Describe the information on orphan-rare diseases obtained in Cali through SIVIGILA in the first 2 years of registration. Materials and methods: Analytical cross-sectional observational study. Absolute and relative frequendes were calculated. Normality analysis of Shapiro Wilk was performed. Prevalence was calculated. The relationship of different sociodemographic and clinical variables and mortality risk was evaluated, using Generalized Linear Models, the Poisson distribution family, Logarithmic link function and robust variance models. Results: 635 cases were notified. 78 in 2016 for a prevalence of 3,25 / 100.000 and 557 in 2017 for a prevalence of 23,01 / 100.000. Most cases belong to the tax system. The communes with the highest number of cases and the highest prevalence were 17 and 22. Among the first most common orphan-rare diseases, sickle cell disease was the most reported in Cali with 25 cases in 2016 (prevalence 1,04/100.000) and 77 cases in 2017 (prevalence 3,1/100.000). The estimated crude mortality rate for the study period was 0,83 / 100.000, and the diseases with the highest mortality were sickle cell disease in women (0,12 / 100.000) and polyneuropathy in men (0,13 / 100.000).

The main goal of this study was to analyze CVD mortality spatially and temporarily in the Pacific region of Colombia during the 2002-2015 period, and its association with some municipal socio-economic indicators using spatial statistical analysis techniques. It involved a descriptive-ecological study in the 177 municipalities of the Pacific region that used CVD mortality data, under codes 100-199 of the International Classification of Diseases (ICD-10), and seven municipal socio-economic indicators. The analysis included the calculation of crude and standardized mortality rates, according to sex, for CVD and its main causes, and modeling of CVD death counts using Bayesian hierarchical models. During the 2002-2015 period, standardized rates of CVD mortality showed a downward trend in men (129.0 to 119.3) and in women (129.0 to 110.0), the main causes of death being ischemic heart diseases, followed by cerebrovascular diseases.

Objective: This study seeks to analyze agreement between the most used scales to estimate the risk of patient morbidity and mortality in a population treated at 2,670 meters above sea level (m.a.s.l.). Materials and methods: Two hundred patients between 18 and 65 years old, diagnosed with acute pancreatitis, were evaluated and treated at the Hospital Universitario San Ignacio, Bogotá (Colombia). Three risk scales were used for the estimations. Scores ≥ 8 in the APACHE II system, ≥ 2 in the Modified Marshall Score, or 3 or more positive Ranson criteria were classified as pancreatitis with severity prognostic marker. Agreement between the results was determined using the Kappa coefficient. Results: According to the Marshall score, 45.5% of the cases were pancreatitis with predicted severity, while APACHE II and Ranson yielded scores of 39.5% and 38.5%, respectively. The Kappa coefficient showed weak agreement between APACHE II and Ranson (Kappa=0.201; 95%CI 0.05-0.34), poor agreement between Ranson and Marshall (Kappa=0.18; 95%CI 0.04-0.32), and moderate agreement between APACHE II and Marshall (Kappa=0.42; 95%CI 0.28-0.56). Conclusions: There is poor agreement between the pancreatitis severity scoring systems used in Colombia, so they cannot be interpreted as clinically equivalent. The data from this study demonstrate the need to validate the scales in Colombia and Latin America. They also suggest that the Marshall scale overestimates the risk in cities above 2,000 m.a.s.l.",Article,"Rodriguez-Varon, Alberto.; Munoz, Oscar Mauricio.; Unknown.; Unknown",Acute pancreatitis;Agreement;Mortality;Multivariate prediction models,Acute pancreatitis;Agreement;Mortality;Multivariate prediction models,Colombia,

An intensive care unitbased concordance study,"Objective: To determine the concordance of mortality risk classification through the use of the Pediatric Index of Mortality (PIM) 2 and 3. Methods: Through a retrospective cohort, we evaluated patients admitted to the pediatric intensive care unit between April 2016 and December 2018. We calculated the mortality risk with the PIM 2 and 3. Analyses were carried out to determine the concordance between the risk classification obtained with both scales using unweighted and linearly weighted kappa. Results: A total of 722 subjects were included, and 66.6% had a chronic condition. The overall mortality was 3.7%. The global kappa concordance coefficient for classifying patients according to risk with the PIM 2 and 3 was moderate at 0.48 (95%CI 0.43 - 0.53). After linear weighting, concordance was substantial at 0.64 (95%CI 0.59 - 0.69). For cardiac surgery patients, concordance for risk classification was fair at 0.30 (95%CI 0.21 - 0.39), and after linear weighting, concordance was only moderate at 0.49 (95%CI 0.39 - 0.59). The PIM 3 assigned a lower risk than the PIM 2 in 44.8% of patients in this subgroup.

The present study aims to demonstrate whether the application of non-pharmacological measures reduces the appearance of this entity in non-ventilated adult patients admitted to a level II ICU. It was found that the application of non-pharmacological measures was associated with a reduction in the risk of developing delirium in clinical, although not statistical, terms. We recommend studies with a larger sample size. Introduction: Delirium is a predictor of mortality and one of the most frequent syndromes in ICUs. Objectives: To determine the effectiveness of the application of non-pharmacological measures vs. standard care in reducing delirium in non-ventilated adult patients admitted to the ICU of the Las Lajas Clinic between June 2015 and March 2016. Design: Clinical trial with random distribution, blinded to the investigator. Scope: The study was carried out in a level II ICU, where both patients with medical and surgical illnesses are admitted. Participants: Eligible patients were adult patients admitted to the Las Lajas Clinic ICU (over 18 years of age), with an expectation of stay in the unit greater than 24 h and Glasgow coma scale ≥ 13, patients who filled out informed consent. Patients who used sedatives, with dementia, delirium or confusion and patients without Medical prognosis were excluded. 168 patients were eligible, of which 145 patients participated in the study. Intervention: In the intervention group, non-pharmacological measures were applied (putting on a mask, ear plugs and an early mobilization protocol was applied), the control group was conventional management continued (no mask placement, no earplugs, and physical therapy was continued as indicated by the treating physician 1 to 2 times a day). The duration of the intervention was during the time they remained in the unit or until the outcome occurred. Main variables of interest: Presentation of delirium, patient mortality at 7 days, length of stay in the ICU. Results: The population median age was 62 years and the median age in the group that developed delirium was 81 years. The proportion of patients who developed delirium in the control group it was 10.3%, while the intervention group was 3.0%. Applying these measures was associated with a reduction in the risk of developing delirium (RR = 0.29, 95% CI 0.06-1.32 p = 0.107).

Methodology: Descriptive-ecological study that uses secondary data on mortality, births and population projections from the National Administrative Department of Statistics (dane). Annual overall and cause-specific mortality rates were calculated (by age, sex and for six large groups of causes of death), using the short list of causes of death 6/67 of the Pan American Health Organization (paho) (communicable diseases, neoplasms/tumors, diseases of the circulatory system, conditions originating in the perinatal period, external causes and other causes). Trends were evaluated using a Poisson regression model with random effects. Results: Higher mortality was found in males (male/female ratio between 1.26-1.61) and in the population over 65 years of age. A downward trend was observed in overall mortality in the four departments, with Valle del Cauca having the highest overall and cause-specific mortality rates. The main cause of death, and with an upward trend, were diseases of the circulatory system, followed by other causes, external causes and neoplasms.

Multiple triage systems have been developed in the world. We propose a statistical model using triage to create an alert system related to mortality rates that could be used as a screening tool during triage. A prospective cohort of 6438 adults who were admitted to the emergency room of Hospital Universitario San Ignacio between 03/01/2018 and /02/28/2019 was used. The data was divided into ""training"" and ""testing"". A bivariate logistic regression between triage and mortality using ""training"" data was done. Afterwards, a multivariate logistic regression was downgraded using the previous information. In order to find the set point, an Area Under the Curve (ROC) was calculated using the ""testing data"". The efficiency was evaluated using measures of association. Three different ROC models were created: ""triage"" which showed an ROC-0.82, ""reduced"" with an ROC-0.90 and ""age+systolic"" with an ROC-0.87, thereby not exhibiting significant difference. The reduced model was chosen, presenting sensitivity of 0.869, specificity of 0.842, PPV 0.062, and NPV 0.998. A set point was chosen according to significant variables, demonstrating a higher mortality rate in those classified as triage 1-2, those over 58 years old, and those presenting with SBP below 117mmHg.

Objective: To evaluate the association between coffee consumption and risk of morbidity and mortality due to cerebrovascular disease. Method: A search was carried out in the Medline, EMBASE, LILACS and Cochrane databases (January 1966 to June 2018), selecting systematic reviews and meta-analyzes evaluated in a standardized and paired way. Six publications were selected. Results: it was found that the consumption of coffee in a moderate range (up to 4 cups) is associated with a reduction in the risk of cerebrovascular disease (relative risk [RR] = 0.89, 95% confidence interval [95%CI]: 0.81-0.97, and RR = 0.83, 95%CI: 0.75-0.91). This protection is maintained in the subgroup of women, with reductions of 13% (95%CI: 0.78-0.97) for a cup, 16% (95%CI: 0.74-0.95) for two cups, and RR = 0.81 (95%CI: 0.70-0.93) for four or more cups. The findings are also significant for the ischemic subtype (RR = 0.80; 95%CI: 0.71-0.90).

In Colombia, there are few reports on the epidemiology of brain tumors, and those that exist are from local databases that don ' t have a rigorous and massive registry. Aim: To determine the survival rates of brain tumors in Colombia. Methods: A retrospective descriptive observational study was conducted, using databases of population-based cancer registries in Colombia. We extracted information from 2003-2012 of patients with tumors without age group restriction. The survival rates were calculated, using the Kaplan-Meier method and the statistical software Stata 14.0. Results: From 2003-2012, 775 adult patients and 123 pediatric patients were reported with a new central nervous system tumor diagnosis in the four cities. The most frequent tumors in the pediatric age group were neuroepithelial tumors, embryonal tumors and ependymal tumors; whereas for adults, the most frequent were neuroepithelial tumors, meningiomas and hematolymphoid tumors. The global survival rate at 6 months, 1 year, 2 years and 3 years, were approximately 49.9%, 35.2%, 21.4% and 15.3% in the pediatric population, and 70.2%, 58.9%, 43.3% and 35.4% in the adult population. Conclusions: The present work constitutes the most recent and multicentric study on the epidemiology of brain tumors in Colombia. There was a clear underreport of this type of tumor and inferior rates compared to universal literature. Despite this, these results will help to widen data recollection and coverage in population-based cancer registries.

The asymptomatic elevation of transaminases is typical in the liver, and liver involvement varies from 14 % to 78 %. The assessment of liver comorbidities is scarce, with prevalence ranging between 2 % and 11 %. Aim: To describe the behavior of a cohort of patients with liver diseases who fell ill with coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19). Materials and methods: This retrospective observational study analyzed the behavior of a cohort of patients with liver diseases who fell ill with COVID-19. Results: 543 patients became ill with COVID-19, of which 300 were women (55.3 %). The median age at diagnosis of liver disease was 52 years. The leading causes of liver disease were nonalcoholic steatohepatitis (49.5 %), cholestatic disease (7.7 %), and hepatitis C and B viruses (6.3 %). Alanine aminotransferase (ALT) had a median of 52 U/L (interquartile range [IQR]: 30–98) and aspartate aminotransferase (AST) 32 U/L (IQR: 23–62). Mortality due to viral infection was 5.7 %, with an incidence rate of 2.9 (95 % confidence interval [CI]: 2–4.2). Conclusions: It is a retrospective study but, until the preparation of the manuscript, it had been the first cohort in Colombia to describe the behavior of liver diseases in patients who become ill with COVID-19.

The study sample comprised 12,410 adults aged 20-59 years from 47 occupational groups in 18 countries. A standardised questionnaire was used to collect information about pain in the past month at each of 10 anatomical sites, and about potential risk factors. Associations with pain outcomes were assessed by Poisson regression, and characterised by prevalence rate ratios (PRRs). Extensive pain, affecting 6-10 anatomical sites, was reported much more frequently than would be expected if the occurrence of pain at each site were independent (674 participants vs 41.9 expected). In comparison with pain involving only 1-3 sites, it showed much stronger associations (relative to no pain) with risk factors such as female sex (PRR 1.6 vs 1.1), older age (PRR 2.6 vs 1.1), somatising tendency (PRR 4.6 vs 1.3), and exposure to multiple physically stressing occupational activities (PRR 5.0 vs 1.4). After adjustment for number of sites with pain, these risk factors showed no additional association with a distribution of pain that was widespread according to the frequently used American College of Rheumatology criteria. Our analysis supports the classification of pain at multiple anatomical sites simply by the number of sites affected, and suggests that extensive pain differs importantly in its associations with risk factors from pain that is limited to only a small number of anatomical sites.

A total of 311 non-institutionalized men and women aged 60 years and older, from the Geriatrics Service of the Peruvian Navy Medical Center (Centro Medico Naval ""Cirujano Mayor Santiago Tavara"") were assessed between May and October 2010. Frailty was defined as having two or more of the following components: (1) unintentional weight-loss, (2) weakness (lowest 20% in grip-strength), (3) self-reported exhaustion, and (4) slow walking speed (lowest 20% 8-m walk-time in seconds). Additionally, information on socio-demographic factors, medical conditions, depressive symptoms, disability, and cognitive function were obtained. Of the 311 participants, 78 (25.1%) were not frail, 147 (47.3%) were pre-frail, and 86 (27.8%) were frail. Using logistic regression analysis, we found that older age, being married, falls in the last year and disability were factors significantly associated with being frail. We conclude that prevalence of pre-frail and frail status in Peruvian Navy Veterans and family members is high. Our data reports risk factors for frailty that have been reported in the past in other population groups. A larger sample and longitudinal follow-up are needed to design and implement comprehensive geriatric interventions that can benefit Peruvian Navy Veteran's older adults at risk of becoming frail.

Obesity is frequently associated with risk factors for cardiovascular and metabolic diseases. Central obesity is a marker of increased intra-abdominal adiposity and a known risk factor for atherosclerosis and diabetes; it is also a good predictor of risk for coronary events, cardiovascular mortality, diabetes and metabolic syndrome. A less predictive alternate measurement is known as the body mass index (BMI). Objective. Obesity prevalence was estimated first by BMI and then by abdominal obesity (measured by waist circumference, WC) in primary care patients. Materials and methods. As part of an international study, primary care physicians recruited consecutive patients aged 18 to 80 years who consulted for any reason on two pre-specified half-days. Age, gender, smoking status and history of cardiovascular disease or diabetes were recorded. Height, weight and WC were measured using standard methods. Pregnant women and subjects unwilling to participate were excluded. Results. A total of 3,795 patients from 105 primary care centers located throughout Colombia were evaluated. The mean age was 45 years (69% females). Of these, 60.7% of males and 53.9% of females were overweight or obese according to their BMI; 24.6% of males and 44.6% of females had abdominal obesity when National Cholesterol Education Program guidelines were used, but numbers changed to 62.5% and 67.0% when the International Diabetes Federation guidelines were used. Obesity, either determined by BMI or by WC, was associated with higher prevalence of diabetes, hypertension and dyslipidemia. Conclusions.

An echocardiogram confirmed the diagnosis of IE. Susceptibility testing showed resistance only to clindamycin. Vancomycin plus gentamicin were started as empirical therapy and, subsequently, the combination of ceftriaxone plus gentamicin was used after susceptibility studies were available. After two weeks of combination therapy, ceftriaxone was continued as monotherapy for six additional weeks with good outcome.ConclusionsTwenty-five cases of IE by Lactococcus garvieae have been reported in the literature. Compared to other Gram-positive cocci, L. garvieae affects more frequently patients with prosthetic valves. IE presents in a subacute manner and the case fatality rate can be as high as 16%, comparable to that of streptococcal IE (15.7%). Reliable methods for identification of L. garvieae include MALDI-TOF, 16S RNA PCR, API 32 strep kit and BD Automated Phoenix System. Recommended antimicrobials for L. garvieae IE are ampicillin, amoxicillin, ceftriaxone or vancomycin in monotherapy or in combination with gentamicin.",Review,"Malek, A.; De la Hoz, A.; Gomez-Villegas, S.I.; Nowbakht, C.; Arias, C.A.",Lactococcus; Case report; Gram positive cocci; Infective endocarditis; Diagnosis; Treatment; Risk factors,Lactococcus;Case report;Gram positive cocci;Infective endocarditis;Diagnosis;Treatment;Risk factors;1ST CASE-REPORT;ASSOCIATION;PATIENT;LACTIS,United States;Colombia,

The aim of this study was to identify predictive factors for conversion and to evaluate morbidity, mortality and hospital stay. Methods: A prospective cohort of patients admitted to the emergency department with acute cholecystitis. We evaluated the statistical significance of the demographic, clinical, biochemical, imaging and surgical factors at admission, associated with conversion to open surgery using a univariate model. The associated factors evaluated during initial analysis were then included in a multivariate analysis. Finally a comparative analysis was made of the morbidity and mortality in both models. Results: A total of 703 patients were included. Conversion rate was 13.8%. Univariate analysis identified as factors: male gender, previous ERCP, leucocytes > 12,000 mm(3), age > 70 years, hypertension, jaundice, cholangitis, total bilirubin > 2 mg/dl, ASA III-IV, gallbladder wall enlargement and choledocholithiasis. Logistic regression identified as predictive factors: previous ERCP, leucocytes, age > 70 years and male gender. Converted patients had a higher morbidity rate, further operations and longer hospital stays (P < .001). No difference was seen in mortality. Discussion: It is important to recognise patients with a higher risk of conversion in order to optimise planning and performing of the surgical procedure, and to decrease the morbidity associated with laparotomy, given that the independent factors identified are not modifiable.

Methods: We performed a register based, case control study using the data from the ECLAMC (Colaborative Latinoamerican Study for Congenital Malformations) in Colombia, between June, 2001 and December, 2004. Positive Registries for any urological anomaly were selected. Calculations for the incidence of each abnormality were done. Odds ratio were estimated for 11 maternal variables. Results: 83 positive registries were found. The established incidence was 0,43%. These anomalies accounted for 9,4% of the total of malformations. The obtained rate (× 10.000 births) for each anomaly was: hypospadias 17,7; chryptorchidism 13,3; hydronephrosis 2,6; cystic renal disease 2,6; undeterminate sex 2,6; unilateral renal agenesis 1, 3; micropenis 1,9; bilateral renal agenesis 0,7; patent urachus 0,3. The risk for renal defects increased with preterm birth, odds ratio OR= 3,66; 95% IC [1, 13-13,82] and maternal chronic disease OR= 6,18; 95% Cl [1,09-34,98]. A deterministic association was found with consanguinity between the parents. The positive associations for genital defects were: low birth weight OR= 4,07; 95% Cl [2,00-8,25], preterm birth OR=3,80; 95% Cl [1,87-7,72], presence of malformated individuals in the family OR= 2,30; 95% Cl [1,02-5,25], and smoking during pregnancy OR= 5,36; IC [1,01-28,51]. A deterministic association was found with alcohol ingestion during pregnancy. Conclusions: The prevalence of anomalies of the urinary tract in Colombia is considerably lower in comparison with european and northamerican statistics. The birth weight is the most important risk factor for anomalies like hypospodias and chriptorchidism. Consanguinity between the parents and alcohol ingestion during the pregnancy are determinant on the risk for renal and genital anomalies, respectively. Variables like smoking during pregnancy and chronic maternal disease must be deeply explored in the future to determine their role in the etiology of these defects.",Article,"Calderon, Juan Sebastian.; Zarante, Ignacio",Chryptochidism;Congenital urinary tract anomalies;Cystic renal disease;ECLAMC;Hypospadias;Incidence;Risk factors,Chryptochidism;Congenital urinary tract anomalies;Cystic renal disease;ECLAMC;Hypospadias;Incidence;Risk factors,Colombia,

Materials and methods: A multicenter matched case-control study was conducted in 7 intensive care units of 3 university hospitals. Data on overall length of hospital stay (including both general wards and the intensive care unit) were recorded. Results: A total of 243 subjects (81 cases and 162 controls) between January 2008 and December 2012 were included. In order of frequency, C. albicans, C. tropicalis and C. parapsilosis were isolated. The main identified risk factors were: overall length of hospital stay > 25 days (OR 5.33, 95% CI 2.6-10.9), use of meropenem (OR 3.75, 95% CI 1.86-7.5), abdominal surgery (OR 2.9, 95% CI 1.39-6.06) and hemodialysis (OR 3.35, 95% CI 1.5-7.7). No differences in mortality between patients with candidemia and controls were found (39.5 vs. 36.5%, respectively, P=.66) were found. Conclusions: In Colombia, a long hospital stay, abdominal surgery, the use of meropenem and hemodialysis were identified as risk factors for candidemia. (C) 2015 Elsevier Espana, S.L.U. and SEMICYUC.

Design: A multinational, cross-sectional, observational study. Methods: The International ChoLesterol management Practice Study (ICLPS) investigated achievement of European Society of Cardiology (ESC)/European Atherosclerosis Society (EAS) guideline low-density lipoprotein cholesterol (LDL-C) targets in patients receiving lipid-modifying therapy in countries outside Western Europe. We examined the rate of, and association between, control of multiple risk factors in ICLPS participants with dyslipidaemia, diabetes and hypertension (N = 2377). Results: Mean (standard deviation) age of patients was 61.4 (10.4) years; 51.3% were male. Type 2 diabetes was the most common form of diabetes (prevalence, 96.9%). The prevalence of metabolic syndrome was 67.8%, obesity 40.4%, atherosclerotic disease 39.6% and coronary artery disease 33.5%. All patients were at high (38.2%) or very high (61.8%) cardiovascular risk according to ESC/EAS guidelines. Body mass index (BMI) was <25 kg/m(2) in 20.3% of patients, 62.8% had never smoked and 25.2% were former smokers. Overall, 12.2% achieved simultaneous control of LDL-C, diabetes and blood pressure. Risk factor control was similar across all participating countries. The proportion of patients achieving individual guideline-specified treatment targets was 43.9% for LDL-C, 55.5% for blood pressure and 39.3% for diabetes. Multiple correspondence analysis indicated that control of LDL-C, control of blood pressure, control of diabetes, BMI and smoking were associated. Conclusion: Comprehensive control of multiple cardiovascular risk factors in high-risk patients is suboptimal worldwide.

The aim of this study was to test the hypothesis that pain, which is localized to the low back, differs epidemiologically from that which occurs simultaneously or close in time to pain at other anatomical sites Summary of Background Data. Low back pain (LBP) often occurs in combination with other regional pain, with which it shares similar psychological and psychosocial risk factors. However, few previous epidemiological studies of LBP have distinguished pain that is confined to the low back from that which occurs as part of a wider distribution of pain. Methods. We analyzed data from CUPID, a cohort study that used baseline and follow-up questionnaires to collect information about musculoskeletal pain, associated disability, and potential risk factors, in 47 occupational groups (office workers, nurses, and others) from 18 countries. Results. Among 12,197 subjects at baseline, 609 (4.9%) reported localized LBP in the past month, and 3820 (31.3%) nonlocalized LBP. Nonlocalized LBP was more frequently associated with sciatica in the past month (48.1% vs. 30.0% of cases), occurred on more days in the past month and past year, was more often disabling for everyday activities (64.1% vs. 47.3% of cases), and had more frequently led to medical consultation and sickness absence from work. It was also more often persistent when participants were followed up after a mean of 14 months (65.6% vs. 54.1% of cases). In adjusted Poisson regression analyses, nonlocalized LBP was differentially associated with risk factors, particularly female sex, older age, and somatizing tendency. There were also marked differences in the relative prevalence of localized and nonlocalized LBP by occupational group. Conclusion. Future epidemiological studies should distinguish where possible between pain that is limited to the low back and LBP that occurs in association with pain at other anatomical locations.",Article,"Coggon, D.; Ntani, G.; Walker-Bone, K.; Palmer, K.T.; Felli, V.E.; Harari, R.; Barrero, L.H.; Felknor, S.A.; Gimeno, D.; Cattrell, A.; Vargas-Prada, S.; Bonzini, M.; Solidaki, E.; Merisalu, E.; Habib, R.R.; Sadeghian, F.; Kadir, M.M.; Warnakulasuriya, S.S.P.; Matsudaira, K.; Nyantumbu, B.; Sim, M.R.; Harcombe, H.; Cox, K.; Sarquis, L.M.M.; Marziale, M.H.; Harari, F.; Freire, R.; Harari, N.; Monroy, M.V.; Quintana, L.A.; Rojas, M.; Harris, E.C.; Serra, C.; Martinez, J.M.; Delclos, G.; Benavides, F.G.; Carugno, M.; Ferrario, M.M.; Pesatori, A.C.; Chatzi, L.; Bitsios, P.; Kogevinas, M.; Oha, K.; Freimann, T.; Sadeghian, A.; Peiris-John, R.J.; Sathiakumar, N.; Wickremasinghe, A.R.; Yoshimura, N.; Kelsall, H.L.; Hoe, V.C.W.; Urquhart, D.M.; Derrett, S.; McBride, D.; Herbison, P.; Gray, A.; Vega, E.J.S.",diagnostic classification; disability; epidemiology; low back pain; medical consultation; occupation; prognosis; risk factors; sciatica; sickness absence; somatizing,diagnostic classification;disability;epidemiology;low back pain;medical consultation;occupation;prognosis;risk factors;sciatica;sickness absence;somatizing;CHRONIC WIDESPREAD PAIN;MUSCULOSKELETAL PAIN;RISK-FACTORS;COHORT;HEALTH;TRANSITION;NECK,United Kingdom;Brazil;Ecuador;Colombia;United States;Spain;Italy;Greece;Estonia;Lebanon;Iran;Pakistan;Sri Lanka;Japan;South Africa;Australia;New Zealand;Costa Rica;Germany;Malaysia,2-s2.0-85019175875
,,,14,WOS:000270252100025,2009,Impact and risk factors of craniofacial malformations in a Colombian population,"Objective: Craniofacial malformations comprise diverse diagnoses, implying a wide range of morbidity and disability among populations. Our aim was to study them as a group and describe their epidemiological factors inside a population as well as finding common risk factors for their presentation in Colombia. Methods: We conducted a case-control study in several Colombian hospitals participating in the ECLAMC (Spanish acronym for Latin-American Collaborative Study of Congenital Malformations) program. For the analysis we included 374 cases of isolated malformations and 728 controls, out of 44,701 births. Results: A rate of 83.67 cases per 10,000 births was found for craniofacial malformations as a group, with an overall sex ratio of 1. We found predominance for their presentation on the right side. As main associations we obtained a positive family history of another craniofacial malformation (OR: 3.10 CI 95% [2.24-4.30]), particularly preauricular tags (OR 52.36 Cl 95% [12.62-217.16]), preauricular pits (OR: 36.35 CI 95% [4.82-274.27]) and cleft lip with or without palate (OR: 2.50 CI 95% [1.07-5.84]). Medication use during pregnancy was also linked to malformations (OR: 2.00 CI 95% [1.38-2.89]). Specific agents such as ferrous sulfate (OR: 1.46 CI 95% [1.13-1.89]), folic acid (OR: 1.35 Cl 95% [1.02-1.79]) and nifedipine (OR: 2.88 CI 95% [1.22-6.79]) also showed a significant correlation. Maternal alcohol use was also identified as a possible risk factor (OR: 2.45 CI 95% [1.39-4.29]). Conclusions: Craniofacial malformations are frequently encountered among the group of congenital defects. When they present in an isolated fashion, familial history is an important risk factor, although some prenatal factors such as alcohol and some medications may have influence over their prevalence.

It is a cross-sectional, cluster sampling study, which recruited 4454 participants aged >= 20 years. The data were collected in community health-care centers by trained health professionals and medical students. The data collected from each subject included, after informed consent, structured questionnaires (clinical, demographic, physical activity, nutritional and psychological), anthropometric measurements (weight, height and waist circumference), body fat by bioelectrical impedance, hand grip, blood pressure, electrocardiogram, and biochemical measurements (standard 75 g oral glucose tolerance test, total cholesterol, HDL-cholesterol, LDL-cholesterol and triglycerides). The data will be used to estimate the prevalence of overweight, obesity, prediabetes, diabetes, hypertension, dyslipidemias, sarcopenia and metabolic syndrome; and to examine their relationships with lifestyle factors. The risk of coronary heart disease and impaired glucose regulation will be estimated using the Framingham Coronary Heart Disease Risk Score and the Latin America adaptation of the Finnish Diabetes Risk Score (LA-FINDRISC), respectively.

METHODS Cross-sectional study included 23 municipalities of Santander, Colombia. Serological IFAT and ELISA tests were undertaken to detect IgG anti-Trypanosoma cruzi. A questionnaire was conducted for assessing the risk factors of each participant. Newborns were evaluated at birth and followed up to 1 year of age to determine congenital infection. RESULTS An overall prevalence of 3.2% (95% CI 2.4-4.2) among 1518 pregnant women was detected. Prevalences by provinces were as follows: Guanentina: 6.0% (95% CI 4.1-8.5), Garcia Rovira: 2.9% (95% CI: 1.5-4.8) and Comunera: 0.4% (0.4-2.3). The main risk factors identified were age >32 years old (OR: 2.1; 95% CI: 1.1-3.9); currently having a thatched roof (OR: 11.8; CI95% 2.2-63.2) and a thatched roof during childhood (OR: 3.0; 95% CI: 1.4-6.6); having below primary school education level (OR: 4.6; 95% CI: 2.2-9.5); and a history of a close contact with the vector (triatomine bugs) at least once during their lifetime (OR: 6.9; 95% CI: 3.7-12.9). No congenital cases were detected by parasitological or serological techniques. CONCLUSIONS Prevalence of Chagas disease in pregnant women is a potential source of infection in this Colombian endemic area.

Its prevalence varies according to the region of the world it is evaluated in. We analyzed a range of maternal, neonatal, and familial variables in a case group and a control group, and compared them with the existing literature.Methods: We collected information from the Latin-American Collaborative Study on Congenital Malformations (ECLAMC) gathered between 2001 and 2006, where we found 27 cases of isolated microtia; we also collected information from 103 control subjects. Data were analyzed using Student's. t and odds ratio (OR).Results: Microtia distribution was 3 (11.1 %) patients with grade I microtia, 19 (70.4 %) with grade II microtia, 2 (7.4 %) with grade III microtia. We found no patients with anotia. Regarding laterality, the right side was involved more often. Male-to-female ratio was 1.7:1. Birthweight ≤ 2,500. g produces an OR of 3.25 (95 % CI, 1.11-9.58) for the development of microtia.Conclusions: Microtia may be directly or indirectly associated with the early onset of labour. Future studies should include long-term follow up of the patients in order to detect possible anomalies of the oculo-auriculo-vertebral spectrum. It is also important to take anthropometric measurements to increase the likelihood of detecting cases of grade I microtia and mid-face hypoplasia, and to define with greater accuracy whether isolated microtia is the mildest form of the oculo-auriculo-vertebral syndrome. © 2009 Elsevier España.

The aim of this study was to evaluate the risk factors associated with MRSA SSTI in Colombia. Methods: A multicenter cohort study with nested case-control design was performed. Patients with an SSTI with at least 48 h of inpatient care were included. Patients with an MRSA SSTI were considered the case group and patients with either a non-MRSA SSTI or with an Methicillin-susceptible S. aureus (MSSA) SSTI were the control groups. A multivariate logistic regression approach was used to evaluate risk factors associated with MRSA SSTI with two different statistical models. Results: A total 1134 patients were included. Cultures were positive for 498 patients, of which 52% (n = 259) were Staphylococcus aureus. MRSA was confirmed in 68.3% of the S. aureus cultures. In the first model, independent risk factors for MRSA SSTI were identified as the presence of abscess (P < 0.0001), cellulitis (P = 0.0007), age 18-44 years (P = 0.001), and previous outpatient treatment in the previous index visit (P = 0.003); surgical site infection was a protective factor (P = 0.008). In the second model, the main risk factor found was previous outpatient treatment in the previous index visit (P = 0.013). Conclusions: Community-acquired SSTIs in Colombia are commonly caused by MRSA. Therefore, clinicians should consider MRSA when designing the initial empirical treatment for purulent SSTI in Colombia, although there seems to be low awareness of this fact. (C) 2019 The Authors.

Objective: To evaluate the risk factors for presentation of bacteremia due to carbapenem-resistant P. aeruginosa acquired in the Hospital Universitario San Ignacio between January 2008 and June 2014. Materials and methods: This was a case control study in which the case patients presented bacteremia due to P. aeruginosa resistant to carbapenems and the control group included patients with P. aeruginosa susceptible to this group of antibiotics. Variables such as the previous use of meropenem and ertapenem, immunosuppression and neoplasia were measured. Mortality and duration of hospital were also described. Results: In all, 168 patients were evaluated, of which 42 were cases and 126 controls. Using a multivariate model, the risk factors related to bacteremia due to carbapenem-resistant P. aeruginosa acquired in hospital were the following: use of parenteral nutrition (OR=8.28; 95% CI: 2.56-26.79; p=0); use of meropenem (OR=1.15; 95% CI: 1.03-1.28; p=0.01); and use of ciprofloxacin (OR=81.99; 95% CI: 1.14-5884; p=0.043). Conclusion: In order to prevent the emergence of carbapenem-resistant P. aeruginosa, antimicrobial control programs should be strengthened by promoting the prudent administration of carbapenems and quinolones.

However, it is a relatively unexplored aspect in the Colombian population. It is important to identify the associated factors in order to develop appropriate treatment strategies. Objective To identify risk factors for suicidal ideation in patients with major depressive disorder between 18 and 65 years in 5 Colombian cities. Methods Data from 295 patients diagnosed with major depressive disorder were used from the Study of the Economic Burden of Depression in Colombia. The association between the clinical and psychosocial variables with the presence of suicidal ideation was assessed using two-level hierarchical models. Results Female sex was a factor associated with a lower risk of suicidal ideation. Factors associated with the presence of suicidal ideation include unemployment, smoking and alcohol use in the past 30 days, mental health perceived as fair or poor, diagnosis of double depression, inpatient treatment, low income, unemployment, and a major financial crisis in the last 2 years. Conclusions Suicidal ideation is highly prevalent in patients with major depressive disorder. Risk factors associated with both the clinical and psychosocial domain must be carefully evaluated during risk assessment of patients with this diagnosis. © 2013 Asociación Colombiana de Psiquiatría.

This paper explores whether the same applies to disabling wrist/hand pain (WHP). Methods Using data from the Cultural and Psychosocial Influences on Disability (CUPID) study, we focused on workers from 45 occupational groups (office workers, nurses and other workers) in 18 countries. Among 11,740 participants who completed a baseline questionnaire about musculoskeletal pain and potential risk factors, 9082 (77%) answered a further questionnaire after a mean interval of 14 months, including 1373 (15%) who reported disabling WHP in the month before follow-up. Poisson regression was used to assess associations of this outcome with baseline risk factors, including the number of anatomical sites other than wrist/hand that had been painful in the 12 months before baseline (taken as an index of general propensity to pain). Results After allowance for other risk factors, the strongest associations were with general pain propensity (prevalence rate ratio for an index >= 6 vs. 0: 3.6, 95% confidence interval 2.9-4.4), and risk rose progressively as the index increased. The population attributable fraction for a pain propensity index > 0 was 49.4%. The prevalence of disabling WHP by occupational group ranged from 0.3 to 36.2%, and correlated strongly with mean pain propensity index (correlation coefficient 0.86). Conclusion Strategies to prevent disability from WHP among working populations should explore ways of reducing general propensity to pain, as well as improving the ergonomics of occupational tasks.",Article,"Coggon, D.; Ntani, G.; Walker-Bone, K.; Felli, V.E.; Harari, F.; Barrero, L.H.; Felknor, S.A.; Rojas, M.; Cattrell, A.; Serra, C.; Borchini, R.; Solidaki, E.; Merisalu, E.; Habib, R.R.; Sadeghian, F.; Kadir, M.M.; Peiris-John, R.J.; Matsudaira, K.; Nyantumbu-Mkhize, B.; Kelsall, H.L.; Harcombe, H.",Wrist; hand pain; Geographical variation; Pain propensity; Risk factors,Wrist;hand pain;Geographical variation;Pain propensity;Risk factors;MUSCULOSKELETAL PAIN;RISK-FACTORS;POPULATIONS;DISORDERS;SYMPTOMS;NECK,United Kingdom;Brazil;Ecuador;Colombia;United States;Costa Rica;Spain;Italy;Greece;Estonia;Lebanon;Iran;Pakistan;New Zealand;Japan;South Africa;Australia,2-s2.0-85072380418

Large-scale genetic association studies have identified variants robustly associated with BC risk in European women. We examine here the relevance of these variants to Colombian BC and possible interactions with genetic ancestry. Native American, European and African proportions were estimated for 1022 Colombian BC cases and 1023 controls. Logistic regression was applied to assess the association between 78 variants and BC risk and interactions between the variants and ancestry proportions. We constructed a multifactorial risk score combining established BC risk factors, associated risk variants and individual ancestry proportions. Each 1% increase in the Native American proportion translated into a 2.2% lower BC risk (95% CI: 1.4-2.9). Thirteen variants were associated with BC in Colombian women, with allele frequencies and risk effects partially different from European women. Ancestry proportions moderated the risk effects of two variants. The ability of Native American proportions to separate Colombian cases and controls (area-under-the-curve (AUC) = 0.61) was similar to the discriminative ability of family history of BC in first-degree female relatives (AUC = 0.58) or the combined effect of all 13 associated risk variants (AUC = 0.57).

Objective: This review discusses the relationships between sleep, obesity, and breathing disorders with concomitant risks of developing cancer. Results: Sleep disorders result in abnormal expression of clock genes, decreased immunity, and melatonin release disruption. Therefore, these disorders may contribute to cancer development. Moreover, in sleep breathing disorder, which is frequently experienced by obese persons, the sufferer experiences intermittent hypoxia that may stimulate cancer cell proliferation. Discussion: During short- or long-duration sleep, sleep -wake rhythm disruption may occur. Insomnia and obstructive sleep apnea increase cancer risks. In short sleepers, an increased risk of stomach cancer, esophageal squamous cell cancer, and breast cancer was observed. Among long sleepers (>9 hours), the risk of some hematologic malignancies is elevated.

Methods: The burden of disease was estimated following an adapted methodology published by the World Health Organization. A selection of diseases was performed in which overweight and obesity are risk factors. DALYs were calculated by obtaining the proportion of cases and deaths of every disease that can be attributable to obesity and overweight conditions. The economic impact of obesity was calculated by multiplying the cost of care per patient for each comorbidity by the number of cases attributable exclusively to obesity. Results: A total of 997 371 DALYs were estimated, 45% of which corresponded to men; 81% of DALYs corresponded to years lived with disability. Conditions with greater attributable DALYs are, in order, hypertension (31.6% of the total DALYs), type 2 diabetes mellitus (28.0%), cardiac ischemic disease (14.6%), and lower back pain (11.2%). An estimation of 20.5 DALYs per 1000 inhabitants was made. The economic impact of care for comorbidities associated with obesity could amount to $2158 million.

The aim of this study was to determine prevalence, risk factors, and neonatal results associated with CDH on a surveillance system hospital-based in Bogota, Colombia. Methods The data used in this study were obtained from The Bogota Birth Defects Surveillance and Follow-up Program (BBDSFP), between January 2001 and December 2013. With 386,419 births, there were 81 cases of CDH. A case-control methodology was conducted with 48 of the total cases of CDH and 192 controls for association analysis. Results The prevalence of CDH was 2.1 per 10,000 births. In the case-control analysis, risk factors found were maternal age >= 35 years (OR, 33.53; 95 % CI, 7.02-160.11), infants with CDH were more likely to be born before 37 weeks of gestation (OR, 5.57; 95 % CI, 2.05-15.14), to weigh less than 2500 g at birth (OR, 9.05; 95 % CI, 3.51-23.32), and be small for gestational age (OR, 5.72; 95 % CI, 2.18-14.99) with a high rate of death before hospital discharge in the CDH population (CDH: 38 % vs BBDSFP:<1 %; p < 0.001). Conclusions The prevalence of CDH calculated was similar to the one reported in the literature. CDH is strongly associated with a high rate of death before hospital discharge and the risk factors found were maternal age >= 35 years, preterm birth, be small for gestational age, and have low weight at birth.

A cross-sectional study,"Background: Motoric Cognitive Risk Syndrome (MCR) is a predementia stage where slow gait speed and subjective memory complaints are present. The purpose of this study was to estimate the prevalence of MCR and assess its relationship with sociodemographic factors and chronic conditions. Methods: This is a secondary analysis of the SABE Colombia study conducted in 2015. The analytic sample consisted of 17·577 participants. After determining MCR prevalence, logistic regression was performed to examine the correlates of MCR. Findings: The prevalence of MCR was 10·71 %. The median age was 71 years and women composed 74·63 % of the MCR group. After adjusting for confounding variables MCR was associated with increasing age (OR 1·69, CI 1·43 - 1·92), no or low education (OR 1·99, CI 1·67- 2·37), MMSE (OR 0·93, CI 0·91 - 0·95) and chronic conditions such as mental disorders (OR 1·36, CI 1·11-1·67), history of myocardial infarction (OR 1·24, CI 1·04 - 1·47), hypertension (OR 1·23, CI 1·08 - 1·40) and diabetes (OR 1.18, CI 1.01 – 1.37). Interpretation: This study found a prevalence of 10·71 % of MCR in Colombian older adults. Additionally, MCR was associated with chronic conditions and sociodemographic factors identified in prior studies. These results increase the awareness of a novel predementia stage whose identification can be performed by clinicians in the outpatient clinic, minimizing the cost of a full neuropsychologic evaluation performed in a memory clinic.

In addition, we used the Principal Component Analysis with polychoric correlations for the construction of composed indicators of wealth, autonomy of the woman, and the use and access to the health system. RESULTS: The average level of community wealth was significantly and independently associated with chronic malnutrition in early childhood, more than the socioeconomic status of the household itself. At the individual and household level, the probability of chronic malnutrition was higher for children from mothers with low levels of autonomy and use and access to the health system, mothers who had their first child in adolescence, and mothers who live in homes in the lowest wealth quintiles. In contrast, children from mothers with a body mass index > 25 and with at least secondary education (versus no education) were less likely to suffer from chronic malnutrition.

Discussion We propose and discuss possible relationships between zoophilia and penile cancer: There could be a confounding factor associated with other sexual practices, probably more common in these patients, or there could be a sexually transmitted virus between species (human papillomavirus, bovine or equine papilloma viruses).

Additionally, 20% of the world's adult population will develop metabolic syndrome during their lifespan with tremendous effects for their wellbeing and the health systems. Objective: To identify social, biological, and behavioral factors associated with the metabolic syndrome in adults to help in the design of health policies in urban environments. Materials and methods: We included 300 cases and 675 controls. For cases, the waist circumference (abdominal obesity) in men was ≥94 cm and ≥88 cm in women, and other two factors should be present including hypertension, high glycated hemoglobin, high triglycerides, and low HDL levels. Controls presented only one or none of these risk factors. Results: The total prevalence of metabolic syndrome was 30.2%, 33.6% in females, and 25.6% in males. Therefore, females had a higher risk of developing a metabolic syndrome (OR=1.70; 95% CI 1.17-2.47). Being a mestizo also increased the risk of having metabolic syndrome (OR=1.55; 95% CI 1.10-2.19). In contrast, frequent fruit consumption and being a housekeeper were protective factors: OR=0.83; 95% CI 0.69-1.00, and OR=0.58; 95% CI 0.36-0.92, respectively. Logistic regression showed that obesity had the strongest association with metabolic syndrome (OR=7.52; 95% CI 4.79-11.80). Increasing age yielded a linear trend with regard to metabolic syndrome: the OR for the 40 to 49-year-old group was 4.24 (95% CI 2.20-8.16), for the 50 to 59-year-old group, 4.63 (95% CI 2.40-8.93), and for those over 80 years of age, 5.32 (95% CI 1.92-14.71).

However, its high costs and logistical difficulties can lead to lack of timely statistics for planning, particularly in low and middle-income countries. Mobile phone surveys (MPS) have the potential to fill these gaps. Objective This study explores perceptions, feasibility and strategies to increase the acceptability and response rate of health surveys administered through MPS using interactive voice response in Colombia. Method A sequential multimodal exploratory design was used. We conducted key informant interviews (KII) with stakeholders from government and academia; focus group discussions (FGDs) and user-group tests (UGTs) with young adults and elderly people living in rural and urban settings (men and women). The KII and FGDs explored perceptions of using mobile phones for NCD surveys. In the UGTs, participants were administered an IVR survey, and they provided feedback on its usability and potential improvement. Results Between February and November 2017, we conducted 7 KII, 6 FGDs (n = 54) and 4 UGTs (n = 34). Most participants consider MPS is a novel way to explore risk factors in NCDs. They also recognize challenges for their implementation including security issues, technological literacy and telecommunications coverage, especially in rural areas. It was recommended to promote the survey using mass media before its deployment and stressing its objectives, responsible institution and data privacy safeguards. The preferences in the survey administration relate to factors such as skills in the use of mobile phones, age, availability of time and educational level. The participants recommend questionnaires shorter than 10 minutes. Conclusions The possibility of obtaining data through MPS at a population level represents an opportunity to improve the availability of risk-factor data.

Specifically, people at risk of Type 2 Diabetes (T2D) have shown to benefit from being physically active. The objective of this study was to explore what factors were associated with low physical activity in people at high risk of T2D living in Bogota and Barranquilla, Colombia. Methodology: Cross-sectional study using baseline data from a quasi-experimental clinical trial (PREDICOL Project). The study included 1,135 participants of Bogota and Barranquilla that presented a high risk of developing T2D according to the Finnish Diabetes Risk Score (>12 points) and who underwent an oral glucose tolerance test. The main outcome variable was the level of physical activity assessed by the International Physical Activity Questionnaire. Unadjusted and adjusted logistic regression analysis were used to calculate odds ratios (OR) and the corresponding 95% confidence intervals (CI). Results: In total, 72.5% of the study participants had low level of physical activity. Participants in the age group between 45 and 54 years showed 74% greater odds of having low physical activity compared with the youngest age group (OR 1.74, 95% CI 1.1 -2.8). People living in Barranquilla were eight times more likely to have low physical activity compared with those in Bogota D.C. (OR 8.1, 95% CI 5.7 to 11.4).

Human cysticercosis poses a substantial public health burden in endemic countries. The World Health Organization (WHO) aims to target high-endemicity settings with enhanced interventions in 17 countries by 2030. Between 2008 and 2010, Colombia undertook a national baseline serosurvey of unprecedented scale, which led to an estimated seroprevalence of T. solium cysticercus antibodies among the general population of 8.6%. Here, we use contemporary geostatistical approaches to analyse this unique dataset with the aim of understanding the spatial distribution and risk factors associated with human cysticercosis in Colombia to inform how best to target intervention strategies. Methods: We used a geostatistical model to estimate individual and household risk factors associated with seropositivity to T. solium cysticercus antibodies from 29,253 people from 133 municipalities in Colombia. We used both independent and spatially structured random effects at neighbourhood/village and municipality levels to account for potential clustering of exposure to T. solium. We present estimates of the distribution and residual correlation of seropositivity at the municipality level. Results: High seroprevalence was identified in municipalities located in the north and south of Colombia, with spatial correlation in seropositivity estimated up to approximately 140 km. Statistically significant risk factors associated with seropositivity to T. solium cysticercus were related to age, sex, educational level, socioeconomic status, use of rainwater, consumption of partially cooked/raw pork meat and possession of dogs. Conclusions: In Colombia, the distribution of human cysticercosis is influenced by socioeconomic considerations, education and environmental factors related to the spread of T. solium eggs. This information can be used to tailor national intervention strategies, such as targeting spatial hotspots and more highly exposed groups, including displaced people and women. Large-scale seroprevalence surveys accompanied by geospatial mapping are an essential step towards reaching the WHO's 2021-2030 NTD roadmap targets.",Article,"Galipo, E.; Dixon, M.A.; Fronterre, C.; Cucunuba, Z.M.; Basanez, M.G.; Stevens, K.; Sanchez, A.C.F.; Walker, M.",Taenia solium; Cysticercosis; Risk factors; Spatial analysis; Geostatistics; Colombia,Taenia solium;Cysticercosis;Risk factors;Spatial analysis;Geostatistics;Colombia;TAENIA-SOLIUM TAENIASIS;PREVALENCE;INFECTION;COMMUNITY;EPIDEMIOLOGY;POPULATION;STRATEGIES;VILLAGE;EGGS,United Kingdom;Colombia,2-s2.0-85120076130

Methods A cross-sectional study with 1135 participants older than 30 years-of-age recruited in Bogota D.C., and Barranquilla by cluster sampling in 2018 to 2019. The Finnish Diabetes Risk Score (FINDRISC) was used to detect participants at risk of developing type 2 diabetes (T2D). HRQoL was assessed using the EQ-5D-3L questionnaire. Unadjusted and adjusted logistic regression models were used to calculate odds ratios (OR) and their corresponding 95% confidence intervals CI). Results Moderate or extreme problems appeared more frequently in the dimensions of Pain/Discomfort (60.8%) and Anxiety/Depression (30.8%). The mean score of the EQ-VAS was 74.3 (+/- 17.3), significantly larger in the state of complete health (11111) compared with those with problems in more than one of the quality-of-life dimensions. Being female and living in Bogota D.C., were associated with greater odds of reporting problems in the Pain (OR 1.6; 95% CI 1.2-2.2) and Discomfort dimensions (OR 1.6; 95% CI 1.2-2.0) respectively and Anxiety/Depression (OR 1.9; 95% CI 1.3-2.7), (OR 9.1; 95% CI 6.6-12.4), respectively. Conclusions As living place and sex were associated with dimensions of Pain/Discomfort and Anxiety/Depression in the HRQoL in people at risk of T2D, greater attention should be paid to these determinants of HRQoL to design and reorient strategies with a territorial and gender perspective to achieve better health outcomes. Plain English summary Diabetes is one of the four non-communicable diseases with increasing prevalence in the world, which has made it a serious public health problem. In Colombia, in 2019 diabetes affected 8.4% of the Colombian adult population and more than one million Colombian adults of this age group have hidden or undetected diabetes. This disease is not only characterized by increased premature mortality, loss of productivity, and economic impact, but it also involves a deterioration in the quality of life of people with diabetes with their respective families. However, very Little is known about health-related quality of life (HRQoL) in a population at risk or with prediabetes. This study has evaluated the quality of life in patients at risk of diabetes and their behavior with some variables as sociodemographic, lifestyle, history, and established their difference in two territories of the Colombian Caribbean. The results of this study indicate that the HRQoL of people at risk of type 2 diabetes is affected by factors such as gender, city, dysglycemia, medication for hypertension and education level. Therefore, greater attention should be paid to these determinants of HRQL to design and implement strategies that reduce this risk of developing type 2 diabetes, prevent prediabetes and improve the quality of life in prediabetic or diabetic patients.",Article,"Arrieta, L.A.A.; Vergara, T.A.; Tuesca, R.; Acosta, S.R.; Lozano, K.C.F.; Aschner, P.; Gabriel, R.; De la Rosa, S.; Castillo, J.P.N.; Barengo, N.C.",Health related quality of life; Hyperglycemia; Type 2 diabetes; Risk factors,Health related quality of life;Hyperglycemia;Type 2 diabetes;Risk factors;IMPAIRED GLUCOSE-METABOLISM;PHYSICAL-ACTIVITY QUESTIONNAIRE;SHORT-FORM;MELLITUS;RELIABILITY;EUROQOL;SCORE;DEPRESSION;TOLERANCE;CONTINUUM,Colombia;Mexico;Spain;United States;Finland,2-s2.0-85121424691

These patients are at increased risk of severe dehydration, electrolytic disturbances, hypovolemic shock, and death. Ureteropelvic junction obstruction (UPJO) is the most common etiology of collecting system dilatation in the fetal kidney, and a significant number of patients require pyeloplasty. There are limited data regarding prognostic risk factors for POD in this scenario. Objective To describe possible clinical risk factors for POD in the pediatric population after open pyeloplasty. Study design This was a retrospective case series study of consecutive patients diagnosed with UPJO at three high complexity centers, managed with open pyeloplasty from 2006 to 2016. Multiple qualitative and quantitative variables possibly associated with POD were included according to the literature review. They were statistically analyzed with STATA 14 software. Results A total of 88 patients with UPJO following open pyeloplasty were analyzed. Twenty-seven patients (30%) had POD. A tendency to present POD in younger patients was found, with a mean age of 20.2 months vs. 72.3 months. There was also an increased risk of POD in patients with previous diagnosis of tubular acidosis. Conclusions There are no data about prognostic clinical risk factors for POD after open pyeloplasty in the pediatric population. Our study corresponds to one of the larger series reported so far. It suggests that younger patients and patients with a previous diagnosis of tubular acidosis could be at greater risk of POD.

In this focused review, we first assess the epidemiology of asthma, review known and potential risk factors, and examine commonalities and differences in asthma management across the Americas. We then discuss future directions in research and health policies to improve the prevention, diagnosis, and management of pediatric and adult asthma in the Americas, including standardized and periodic assessment of asthma burden across the region; large-scale longitudinal studies including omics and comprehensive environmental data on racially and ethnically diverse populations; and dissemination and implementation of guidelines for asthma management across the spectrum of disease severity. New initiatives should recognize differences in socioeconomic development and health care systems across the region while paying particular attention to novel or more impactful risk factors for asthma in the Americas, including indoor pollutants such as biomass fuel, tobacco use, infectious agents and the microbiome, and psychosocial stressor and chronic stress.",Review,"Forno, E.; Brandenburg, D.D.; Castro-Rodriguez, J.A.; Celis-Preciado, C.A.; Holguin, F.; Licskai, C.; Lovinsky-Desir, S.; Pizzichini, M.; Teper, A.; Yang, C.; Celedon, J.C.",asthma; Americas; risk factors; treatment,asthma;Americas;risk factors;treatment;GENOME-WIDE ASSOCIATION;CHILDHOOD ASTHMA;AIR-POLLUTION;UNITED-STATES;RISK-FACTORS;VIOLENCE EXPOSURE;HEALTH INEQUITIES;LATIN-AMERICA;LUNG-FUNCTION;EARLY-LIFE,United States;Brazil;Chile;Colombia;Canada;Argentina,

However, it is precisely infectious in nature with the possibility of generating a chronic systemic inflammatory response that could favour its association with diseases, such as endothelial dysfunction, hypertension, CVD, and diabetes. Purpose: The aim of the study was to analyze the relationship of endothelial dysfunction measured by flow-mediated vasodilation in the brachial artery with periodontal disease and other possible factors. Methods: A case-control study was carried out in which those who had periodontitis were defined as cases, and those who were periodontally healthy or had gingivitis were defined as controls. A clinical history was obtained from all patients, and all patients underwent biofilm control and periodontal examinations. Blood tests were performed to determine CBC, glycaemia, total cholesterol, HDL-C, and LDL-C levels, and standardized procedures were used to measure flow-mediated dilation. Results: A total of 202 patients were included in this study: 101 controls [healthy:-gingivitis] and 101 cases [periodontitis]. Regarding sex, glycaemia [p = 0.019] and triglycerides [p = 0.001] levels and initial flow-mediated vasodilation [p = 0.001] and final flow-mediated vasodilation [p = 0.001] values were higher in men, while HDL values were lower [p = 0.001.

Disease symptoms are nonspecific and, therefore, their clinical diagnosis is difficult. Indirect immunofluorescence (IFA) is the gold standard assay for diagnosis. The interest for conducting studies on these pathologies has resurfaced in Colombia since 2001; besides, previous studies have evidenced cases of rickettsiosis in the north of the department of Caldas. Objective: To establish the frequency of antibodies and seroconversion against Rickettsia spp. In patients consulting health institutions in Caldas, Colombia, from 2016 to 2019. Materials and methods: We conducted a quantitative, observational, and descriptive study on a non-probabilistic sample of 175 patients with symptoms compatible with rickettsiosis who consulted in different municipalities of Caldas, Colombia; IFA was performed to detect antibodies in the acute and convalescent phases against Rickettsia rickettsii, Rickettsia typhi, and Rickettsia felis. Results: The average age of the patients was 31 years. The municipalities with the highest proportion of seropositive cases were Belalcazar, Chinchina, Filadelfia, La Dorada, La Merced, and Manizales; 66% of patients owned pets and 12% reported arthropod bites.

Searches were done through the search engine Pubmed. Additionally, public institution websites for each country were consulted. Conclusions: Juvenile delinquency is now understood as a multi-factorial phenomenon with multiple areas of intervention within which economic, domestic and social factors are considered relevant, since these favor the development of criminal behavior. A similarity was found between Colombian and Argentinian systems; both are based on restorative justice that seeks reparation and not punishment; which is why there are no punitive measures.

Nineteen patients (24%) had active RA, 48 (61%) had moderately active RA, and 12 (15%) were in remission. Symptoms of depression, helplessness, disability, pain, anxiety, lower quality of life, and self-efficacy were associated with RA activity regardless of age, sex, and duration of the disease. Symptoms of depression were directly correlated with anxiety, helplessness, pain, and disability and inversely correlated with quality of life and self-efficacy. Although family dysfunction was present in 39% of patients, no associations between family dysfunction, activity of RA, mental health variables, socioeconomical status or quality of fife were observed.

We will focus on cancer types with a good average prognosis when detected and treated adequately and which are prioritized in national policies and cancer plans: cancers of the breast, cervix, prostate, colorectum and childhood cancers. These cancers have a quite poor prognosis compared to high-income countries. We find that, despite having achieved an almost ""universal health coverage"", Colombia suffers serious problems in accessibility to preventative, diagnostic and treatment services for patients with cancer. People living in poverty have lower real access to all types of care, but other problems are due to lack of health literacy, beliefs and knowledge.

SABE Study, Bogotá, Colombia","Objective: To determine the impact of pain on the quality of life in older adults and its association with functionality. Materials and methods: Data was taken from SABE Bogota study. A cross-sectional study was carried out during 2012, interviewing 2,000 individuals of 60 years and older, as a probabilistic cluster and representative sample. The variable 'presence of pain' to was used to identify associations with sociodemographic factors, self-rated health, comorbidities, functional status, cognitive status, and quality of life. The latter was estimated using a visual analogue scale of the EuroQOL tool (EQ-VAS). Results: The majority of older adults were women (63.4%); the mean age was 71.17 years (SD = 8.05), with a higher frequency of individuals in the age group between 60 and 69 years (48%). When comparing groups with pain vs. no pain, significantly lower scores were found in the group with pain (P < .001) in both the functionality and quality of life EQ-VAS scales. The strongest associations with pain were: joint diseases (OR: 3.08 [2.24-4.23]), severe depression (OR: 2.80 [1.63-4.79]) and functional impairment of the Basic Activities of Daily Living (BADL) (OR: 2.45 [1.31-4.58]).

Pompe disease is very rare (1:40,000 births incidence). Methods A literature review was made and historic databases searched for National Health Service (NHS) reimbursed costs in England and by health insurers in Colombia; expert opinion was elicited. Two Markov models were constructed for comparing both countries; alive with symptoms and dead were the transition states used. Patients aged ≤ 6 months receiving ERT were assumed to have 75 % survival rate and better health-related quality of life (HR-QoL) compared to those without treatment (0.700 HR- QoL using the EQ-5D scale). Results The incremental cost-effectiveness ratio (ICER) per quality-adjusted life year (QALY) gained was £234,307.7 for England and £109,991 for Colombia. Uncertainty about final HR-QoL with ERT, disease progression and cost from palliative care had the biggest impact on the ICER in both models. If ERT costs were reduced to 10,000 times per dose and HR-QoL was 0.750-0.820 ICER, then £165,000 could be attainable for England and £65,000 for Colombia. Transaction costs per case in Colombia were high. Conclusions ERT was more effective than no ERT in treating infantile Pompe disease, but high levels of uncertainty still remain about survival and progression rates and QoL in the long-run. ICERs were high compared to CE thresholds.

Breast reconstruction, either immediate or delayed, is part of the treatment of breast cancer. Each country and health system pays for and evaluates these procedures in different ways. Thus, it is important to determine which strategy is most cost-effective in Colombia. Objective: To evaluate the cost-utility of breast cancer treatment with immediate reconstruction compared with delayed reconstruction. Materials and methods: We used a decision tree model and a one-year time horizon from the perspective of the third-party payer; the cost data were taken from the Colombian Instituto de Seguros Sociales 2001 rate manual plus a 30% adjustment according to the methodology of the Instituto de Evaluacion Tecnologica en Salud, IETS, and the billing model of the Centro Javeriano de Oncologia at the Hospital Universitario San Ignacio. The transition probabilities and profits were obtained from medical specialists, patients, and the medical literature. We also conducted univariate and probabilistic sensitivity analyses. Results: The expected costs per capita were COP$ 26,710,605 (USD$ 11,165) for the immediate reconstruction and COP$ 26,459,557 (USD$ 11,060) for the deferred reconstruction. Immediate reconstruction generated an incremental cost of COP$ 251,049 (USD$ 105) and 0.75 quality-adjusted life years (QALY), while deferred reconstruction generated 0.63 QALYs, with an incremental cost-utility ratio of COP$ 2,154,675 per QALY (USD$ 901). Conclusions: The cost per QALY did not exceed the acceptability threshold of the Gross Domestic Product (GDP) per capita. The costs for the first year were similar.

In this study of community-living older adults, our objective was to quantify outcome changes following identification and treatment of malnutrition or its risk. Design: Our intervention was a nutritional quality improvement program (QIP). The nutritional QIP included: (i) education of participants about the importance of complete and balanced macro- and micronutrient intake plus physical exercise, (ii) nutritional intervention with dietary counseling; and (iii) provision of oral nutritional supplements (ONS) for daily intake over 60 days. Follow-up measurements took place 30 days after ONS treatment ended, i.e., 90 days after start of intervention. Setting and participants: We recruited 618 transitional-care, chronically ill, older adults ( 60 years) with malnutrition/risk (per Mini Nutrition Assessment-Short Form, MNA-SF) from the outpatient clinic of Hospital Universitario San Ignacio, in Bogota???, Colombia. Methods: For pre-post comparisons, we examined cognition (Mini-Mental State Exam, MMSE), physical abilities (Barthel Activities of Daily Living, ADL; Short Physical Performance Battery, SPPB), affective disorder status (Global Depression Scale, GDS), and quality of life (QoL; EuroQoL-5D-3L, EQ-5D-3L; EuroQoL-Visual Analog Scale, EQ-VAS).

Methods: The adaptation process involved 3 phases: translation, cognitive debriefing interviews, and a validation survey. To evaluate the psychometric properties, we recruited individuals >= 18 years of age who had been diagnosed with PAH or CTEPH to take part in the latter two stages of the adaptation process. All individuals were being followed on an outpatient basis by the pulmonary hypertension programs at Hospital Universitario San Ignacio, Fundacion Clinica Shaio, and Clinicos IPS, all located in the city of Bogota, Colombia. Results: A Spanish-language version of the CAMPHOR was developed for use in Colombia. The internal consistency was excellent for the symptoms, functioning, and quality of life scales (Cronbach's alpha coefficients of 0.92, 0.87, and 0.93, respectively). Test-retest reliability was above 0.70. The evaluation of the convergent validity and known group validity of the CAMPHOR scales confirmed that there were moderate and strong correlations with the related constructs of the Medical Outcomes Study 36-item Short-Form Health Survey, version 2, as well as showing their capacity to discriminate disease severity. Conclusions: The Spanish-language version of the CAMPHOR developed for use in Colombia was the result of a translation and cultural adaptation process that allows us to consider it equivalent to the original version, having shown good psychometric properties in the study sample.

While it has been extensively studied in mental health care, there is little evidence for how to use it in primary care settings for patients with chronic physical conditions. Considering that DIALOG+ is used in existing routine patient-clinician meetings and is very low cost, it may have the potential to help large numbers of patients with chronic physical conditions, mental distress and poor quality of life who are treated in primary care. This is particularly relevant in low- and middle-income countries (LMICs) where resources for specialised services for such patients are scarce or non-existent. Methods: An exploratory non-controlled trial will be conducted to primarily assess the feasibility and acceptability and, secondarily, outcomes of delivering DIALOG+ to patients with chronic physical conditions and poor quality of life in primary care settings in Bosnia and Herzegovina, Colombia and Uganda. Thirty patients in each country will receive DIALOG+ up to three times in monthly meetings over a 3-month period. Feasibility will be assessed by determining the extent to which the intervention is implemented as planned. Experiences will be captured in interviews and focus groups with care providers and participants to understand acceptability. Quality of life, symptoms of anxiety and depression, objective social situation and health status will be assessed at baseline and again after the three-session intervention. Discussion: This study will inform our understanding of the extent to which DIALOG+ may be used in the routine care of patients with chronic physical conditions in different primary care settings. The findings of this exploratory trial can inform the design of future full randomised controlled trials of DIALOG+ in primary care settings in LMICs.

To describe perceptions of the end-of-life care given to cancer patients among physicians in three medium and high-complexity hospitals in Popayán and Bogotá in 2019-2020. Methods. We used a cross-sectional design, which consisted of applying a self-administered questionnaire to physicians that measured physicians' perceptions of end-of-life care provided to cancer patients during their last month of life. Results. We identified 341 patient deaths and obtained 261 responses from their treating physicians (response rate 76.7%). In 70% of cases, the physicians considered that death was not a consequence of medical intervention and 85% classified the applied therapeutic strategies as symptomatic palliative care. In 87% of cases, the physicians indicated that they felt comfortable with regards to the medical care provided during the end-of-life process. 48% stated that they did not speak to family members, and 73% did not speak to patients, regarding the possibility that a potential consequence of intervention or no intervention, could be a shortened life expectancy. Conclusion. Physicians have an interest in the end-of-life care of cancer patients and are generally at ease with the medical care provided.

This study is aimed at understanding the effect that refractory GMG has on the quality of life of patients who suffer from it, and the effect of eculitumah on it. A systematic literature search was conducted in MEDLINE (Ovid), EMBASE and the Cochrane Database of Systematic Reviews (Ovid). Eligibility criteria were verified via the title and summary and afterward through the full text. The risk of bias of the included randomized clinical trials was evaluated and the data were synthesized in a descriptive manner. Nine studies were identified that evaluated the quality of life of patients with GMG. Regarding the effect of eculizumab, two studies were identified. The quality of life in patients with GMG is lower compared to ocular myasthenia gravis (MG) and MG in remission, especially in the domains of physical function, physical role, bodily pain, vitality, and social function. Patients treated with eculizumab had a better perception of their quality of life compared to those who received placebo. GMG affects the quality of life more than other types of MG. This outcome is of great importance for the choice of therapeutic options in patients with refractory GMG. Eculizumah generates improvements in the perception of patients' quality of life compared to placebo, making it a relevant therapeutic option in the management of refractory GMG.",Review,"Garzon-Orjuela, N.; van der Werf, L.; Prieto-Pinto, L.C.; Lasalvia, P.; Castaneda-Cardona, C.; Rosselli, D.",Myasthenia gravis; refractory generalized myasthenia gravis; quality of life; generalized myasthenia gravis,Myasthenia gravis;refractory generalized myasthenia gravis;quality of life;generalized myasthenia gravis;ECULIZUMAB,Colombia,2-s2.0-85079009806

We aim to characterize LUTS and to evaluate the correlation and agreement between uroflowmetry and the International Prostate Symptom Score (IPSS) in patients after RRP in two reference centers. Methods: An observational multicenter prospective study was conducted between December 2015 and September 2016. Patients with at least 12-months of follow-up after RRP were included; these were evaluated with uroflowmetry and the IPSS. Results: A total of 90 patients were included. The mean follow-up was of 54.6 months (standard deviation [SD] = 27.52), and the mean age was 65 (SD = 6.85) years old. The mean IPSS was 7.41 (SD = 6.29), with 33.3% (n = 54) of the patients with moderate symptoms and 6.7% (n = 6) with severe symptoms. A total of 50% (n = 45) of the patients had normal uroflowmetry. Patients with an abnormal/equivocal result in the uroflowmetry had a mean of 9.31 (SD = 7.03) points in the IPSS versus 5.51 (SD = 4.82) in patients with a normal uroflowmetry result (p < 0.01). The level of agreement between mild versus moderate-to-severe LUTS and normal uroflowmetry versus abnormal/equivocal was 61.1% (k = 0.22, p = 0.04). We found that a score ≥ 10 in the IPSS had a level of agreement of 65.6% (k = 0.31, p = 0.0004).

The mean age of people with SCI is 35 years in Colombia, and 76% of those affected are men. Approximately 80% of men with SCI preserve their ability to have an erection. Materials and methods A multicentre cross-sectional study was conducted on 35 men with SCI, who attended Urology Clinics in different Colombian cities. They were asked to complete a self-administered questionnaire developed to assess erectile function, sexual health, and sexual preferences. The aetiology of the injuries were diverse and the level of injury in the spinal cord was from C5 up to L5. Results As regards sexual health, it was found that 63% of SCI men were sexually active 12 months after the injury, and self-reported their sexual life as satisfactory. The main problems interfering with their sexuality were, in order of importance, spasticity, the lack of erection rigidity, and the loss of sensory and motor functions Erectile function and sexual desire remain preserved in 88% and 77% of the individuals, respectively, but as regards ejaculatory function, only 37% of the SCI men were able to ejaculate. Sexual preferences and sexual activities remained the same after the injury. Conclusion The majority of SCI individuals are sexually active and have a satisfactory sexual performance, although only a few patients have been given fertility and sexuality counselling. Sexual function must be part of the rehabilitation process of SCI patients, as it is known that continuation of sexual activity after injury is very important, and has a great impact on quality of life. These patients should be assessed and counselled by a multidisciplinary team and the erectile function, ejaculation function, and alternative sexual activities should be included in the rehabilitation program.

Recently, researchers have begun to study the relationship between sexual function and the effect of interventions aimed at reducing weight. Objective To describe the changes induced by bariatric surgery in sexual function in a group of obese patients. Methods Prospective observational study of patients with morbid obesity and bariatric surgery. Sexual function was evaluated in men with the abbreviated sexual health inventory for men questionnaire (SHIM) and the self-esteem and relationship questionnaire (SEAR), and in women with the Female Sexual Function Index (IFSF). Quality of life with the SF-12 questionnaire. Nonparametric statistical tests were used. Results 19 patients were included. 13 women with an average age of 45.3 years (22-59) and 6 men with an average of 41 years (36-54). The average follow-up was 19 months (13.1-25.9). For IFSF, all the domains showed improvement, although desire variable was the only one with statistically significant difference (p = 0.027).

This study tests DIALOG+, an app-based intervention to make routine patient-clinician meetings therapeutically effective. It combines a structured evaluation of patient satisfaction with a solution-focused approach. Methods: We conducted a qualitative study, based on a controlled clinical trial, in which 9 psychiatrists and 18 patients used DIALOG+ monthly over a six-month period. Semi-structured interviews were used to explore the experiences of participants and analysed in an inductive thematic analysis focusing on the feasibility and effects of the intervention in the Colombian context. Results: Experiences were grouped into five overall themes: a) impact of the intervention on the consultation and the doctor-patient relationship; b) impact on patients and in promoting change; c) use of the supporting app, and d) adaptability of the intervention to the Colombian healthcare system. Conclusions: DIALOG+ was positively valued by most of the participants. Participants felt that it was beneficial to the routine consultation, improved communication and empowered patients to take a leading role in their care.

However, little is known about how health-related quality of life (HRQoL) and health literacy are related among those with the two most common types of health insurance coverage: subsidised (those with lower incomes) and contributory (those with higher incomes) coverage. Objectives and methods: In the current exploratory investigation, data from adults visiting six primary care clinics in Colombia were analysed to examine the relationship between HRQoL (assessed as problems with mobility, self-care, completing usual activities, pain/discomfort, and anxiety/depression), demographics, the two health insurance types, and health literacy. Analyses also assessed whether, within insurance types, health literacy was related to HRQoL. Results: Results showed that those with contributory health insurance coverage had greater health literacy than those with subsidised coverage, and this was accounted for by differences in education and socioeconomic status. HRQoL did not differ by insurance type. Although lower health literacy was related to worse HRQoL in the overall sample, in subgroup analyses lower health literacy significantly related to worse HRQoL only among those with subsidised health insurance coverage. Conclusion: Targeting skills which contribute to health literacy, such as interpreting medical information or filling out forms, may improve HRQoL, particularly in those with subsidised insurance coverage.",Article,"Unknown.; Castro-Diaz, Sergio.; Cubillos, Leonardo.; Suarez-Obando, Fernando.; Torrey, William C.; Uribe, Jose Miguel.; Unknown.; Marsch, Lisa A.; Gomez-Restrepo, Carlos",Health literacy;Primary care;Quality of life,Health literacy;Primary care;Quality of life,Colombia;Colombia;United States;United States,

We also seek to evaluate the differences between the QoL reported by the patients (P-QoL) and the scores reported by the caregivers (C-QoL). Methods An analysis of 75 patients with the PSEN1-E280A mutation with mild cognitive impairment and dementia was performed. We used the Quality of Life in Alzheimer Disease (QoL-AD) survey to evaluate QoL as an outcome and evaluated its association with sociodemographic, lifestyle, clinical, and past medical history variables. Results The largest difference in the median of the QoL-AD score was in those who needed help to eat, those with moderate or severe dementia, those classified as frail or pre-frail, those with moderate social risk, and those with depression. Also, C-QoL was lower than the P-QoL, and the QoL-AD of individuals with severe dementia was lower than for milder forms of the disease. Not needing help to eat, not having a stressful situation in the past 3 months, and the years of education were positively correlated with QoL-AD in the linear model.

Materials and Methods The data of patients who underwent RP at Hospital Universitario San Ignacio from 2005 to 2015 was reviewed. Patients who underwent RP more than 12 months ago where selected and with previous verbal consent a UCLA PCI questionnaire was completed by phone. The information was organized in a database to apply descriptive statistics which allowed to summarize and analyze the results. Results During the years analyzed there were performed 231 radical prostatectomies. It was possible to contact 112 by phone to get the UCLA PCI questionnaire completed. In the urinary function domain, 57% of patients report to “have total control of urine,” 53% never leak, 82% of them do not require the use of pads and 62% have urine leakage less than once a week. Regarding sexual function, 69,3% scored their ability to have an erection as poor or very poor, 25% medium and 7% good or very good. For 20% it was sufficient to achieve coitus. And for 52% this function means a problem in their life. The impact on life quality showed that 91.8% of patients felt that their health in general was very good, good or excellent and 70% did not have any physical limitation. Conclusions Radical prostatectomy has an important and no insignificant impact in patients’ quality of life, especially regarding urinary function and sexual function. Its impact in quality of life should be considered at the moment of counseling the patients when taking decisions about curative prostate cancer treatment",Article,"Basto, Catalina Sanchez.; Unknown.; Herrera, Ana carolina Lizcano.; Chavarriaga, Julian.; Unknown.; Unknown.; Garcia, Nayib Fakih.; Unknown",Comorbidity;Erectile dysfunction;Prostate cancer;Quality of life;Radical prostatectomy;Urinary incontinence,Comorbidity;Erectile dysfunction;Prostate cancer;Quality of life;Radical prostatectomy;Urinary incontinence,Colombia;Colombia;Colombia,

Therefore, it is associated with biopsychosocial dysfunction and severe compromise of their quality of life. In Colombia there have been notable advances of a constitutional and legislative nature in the last two decades, which are discussed in the present review. In the multidisciplinary treatment of transgender patients, the last step corresponds to genital reassignment surgery. The purpose of this review is to investigate the current status of genital reassignment surgery within the national context.",Review,"Silva Herrera, Jose Miguel.; Unknown.; Bravo-Balado, Alejandra.; Unknown.; Unknown.; Unknown",Colombia;Gender dysphoria;Genital reassignment surgery;Legislation;Quality of life;Transsexualism,Colombia;Gender dysphoria;Genital reassignment surgery;Legislation;Quality of life;Transsexualism,Colombia;Colombia;Colombia,

Methods: This is a descriptive cross-sectional study with Colombian childhood cancer survivors (CCS) who were diagnosed before the age of 18, at the moment of study were ≥18 years, and at least 5 years had passed since diagnosis. Each participant completed a self-reported study-specific online questionnaire along with the SF-36 Health Survey to assess the prevalence of health problems and current quality of life (QoL). Data were analyzed using descriptive statistics and independent sample t-tests. Results: Out of the 122 CCS who participated, 100% reported at least one health problem, mostly gastritis, headaches, and lack of concentration, followed by obesity and fertility issues. In general, they had a good perception of their QoL, which was, on average, only diminished in the areas of vitality, emotional role functioning, and social functioning. Conclusion: Perceived health problems among the participating Colombian CCS were prevalent; most reported a good self-perceived QoL. This is the first study on understanding health problems and QoL of CCS treated in Colombia and South America. It reopens the debate on the need to carry out long-term follow-up in this population among Colombian society.",Article,"Godoy-Casasbuenas, Natalia.; de Vries, Esther",quality of life;self-reported health problems;survivors of childhood cancer,quality of life;self-reported health problems;survivors of childhood cancer,Colombia;Colombia,

Few studies have compared the Health-Related Quality of Life (HRQoL) in patients with and without MCI due to PD (PD-MCI), and its correlation to patients’ subjective cognitive and communicative difficulties has not been explored. Objective: We aimed to compare HRQoL in PD-MCI and PD without MCI (PD-nMCI), and explore its possible relationship to subjective cognitive and communicative complaints. Methods: We included 29 PD-nMCI and 11 PD-MCI patients. The HRQoL was assessed with the Parkinson's Disease Questionnaire-39 (PDQ-39): its Cognition dimension was used as a measure of subjective cognitive complaints, its Communication dimension for subjective communicative complaints, and the summary index (PDQ-39 SI) as an indicator of HRQoL. Non-parametric partial correlations between the Cognition and Communication dimensions, and the adjusted PDQ-39 SI were conducted. Results: PD-MCI patients had greater subjective cognitive and communicative complaints and worse HRQoL than PD-nMCI patients. In the PD-MCI group, both subjective cognitive and communicative complaints exhibited significant direct correlations with the adjusted HRQoL scores. Conclusions: HRQoL seems to be affected in PD-MCI, and it might be influenced by greater subjective cognitive and communicative complaints. Including patient-reported outcome measures of HRQoL, and providing cognitive and speech rehabilitation, as well as psychotherapeutic strategies to face these deficits can enhance the patient-centred approach in PD.",Article,"Unknown.; Unknown.; Unknown.; Pineda Salazar, David Antonio.; Unknown.; Unknown.; Unknown.; Unknown.; Vasquez, Daniel.; Unknown.; Borda, Miguel German.; Garcia-Cifuentes, Elkin.; Unknown.; Unknown.; Aarsland, Dag.; Unknown",Cognitive decline;Health-related quality of life;Mild cognitive impairment.;Parkinson's disease;Quality of life,Cognitive decline;Health-related quality of life;Mild cognitive impairment.;Parkinson's disease;Quality of life,Norway;Colombia;Colombia;Colombia;Norway;United Kingdom;Colombia,

Thus, a reflection on how possibilities of access to the flows and interactions that materialize in urban facilities can determine the conditions of segregation of individuals and social groups. Through a sociological and geographic review using spatial and conceptual analysis, this article establishes the importance of facilities as places of production of social capital, to reduce inequality and poverty in urban contexts. It concludes there is a verifiable relationship between access to urban facilities of education, culture, and recreation and quality of life in Bogota. Finally, it considers that a policy to improve the quality of life in Latin American cities should seek to strengthen spaces that allow for individuals to cross cognitive horizons and the interaction of members of society in their daily lives.",Article,"Mayorga-Henao, J.M.",Quality of life; social behavior; socioeconomic stratification; urban social integration; social participation; urban poverty; socio-spatial segregation,Quality of life;social behavior;socioeconomic stratification;urban social integration;social participation;urban poverty;socio-spatial segregation,Colombia,

Objective: To determine the perceived health, self-efficacy and attitude towards drug use in children aged 8 to 12 years who attend schools in a town in Bogotá. Method: A descriptive quantitative research was carried out on 467 boys and girls aged 8 to 12 from six schools in a town in Bogotá. A sociodemographic questionnaire, Albert Bandura's Perceived Self-Efficacy Instrument, the Kidscreen Instrument 27 and the questionnaire on attitude towards drug use were applied. Results: Contact with cigarettes and alcohol is evident from the age of 8 with significant differences according to age and sex. Boys seem to come first into contact with alcohol, while girls do so with cigarettes. Those who have had contact with alcohol and tobacco reported lower levels of self-efficacy and perceived health. Conclusion: Contact with alcohol and tobacco occurs at early ages, with a significant proportion of alcohol consumption, sometime in life, between 8 and 12 years old, which makes it necessary to expand the research on consumption in this age group from a gender perspective. Drug use prevention programs must be articulated in a transversal way with the health, education and family sectors, so that parents and teachers are involved in them.",Article,"Melo-Hurtado, Dora Stella.; Unknown.; Unknown",Alcohol consumption in minors;Attitude;Consumption of alcoholic beverages;Primary prevention;Quality of life;Self-efficacy,Alcohol consumption in minors;Attitude;Consumption of alcoholic beverages;Primary prevention;Quality of life;Self-efficacy,Colombia,

Results from a national prevalence study,"Objective To describe the prevalence of overactive bladder determining patient-reported outcome measures (PROMS) and potential risk factors. Methods A cross-sectional population-based study to estimate lower urinary tract symptoms (LUTS) prevalence in the Colombian population was performed (COBaLT study). Overactive bladder (OAB) was assessed using 2002 International Continence Society definitions and the Report on the Terminology for Female Pelvic Floor Dysfunction. PROMS were included to evaluate participant's perceptions of health-related quality of life (QoL). Spanish validated questionnaires were used, including the International Consultation on Incontinence Questionnaire Overactive Bladder (ICIQ-OAB) and Patient Perception of Bladder Condition (PPBC) scale. Results A total of 1060 individuals were assessed. The mean age of participants was 42.2 years, and most participants were Hispanic (93.15%). The overall prevalence of OAB syndrome was 31.70%, and it was more frequently reported in women than in men (39.25% vs. 24.15%). Most participants with OAB did not perceive their symptoms as bothersome. The most bothersome symptom, associated with moderate/severe impact in QoL was urinary urgency. According to the PPBC questionnaire 75.6% of the participants reported that their bladder condition does not cause any problem, while 11.% reported moderate to severe bother. The multivariable model showed high blood pressure and anxiety were associated with OAB in men. In females, depression, obstructive sleep apnea, IBS, and pelvic organ prolapse were associated with OAB syndrome. Conclusions Using the symptomatic definition of OAB can overestimate the real impact and burden of the condition, and treatment should be targeted to those symptomatic patients with QoL impairment as they would benefit from further management. The questionnaires seem to overestimate the condition, since we assessed it from a PROMS perspective there is not such a marked QoL impact.",Article,"Santander, J.; Plata, M.; Zuluaga, L.; Azuero, J.; Daza, F.; Trujillo, C.G.; Caicedo, J.I.; Rondon, M.",overactive bladder; PROMS; quality of life,overactive bladder;PROMS;quality of life;URINARY-TRACT SYMPTOMS;QUALITY-OF-LIFE;PELVIC ORGAN PROLAPSE;INCONTINENCE;IMPACT;HYPERTENSION;VALIDATION;SEEKING;WOMEN;PPBC,Colombia,2-s2.0-85125433015
