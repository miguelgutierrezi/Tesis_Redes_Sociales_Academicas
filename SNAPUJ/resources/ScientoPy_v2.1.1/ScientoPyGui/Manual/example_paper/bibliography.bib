  Abstract                 = {Social Internet of Things is a new paradigm where Internet of Things merges with Social Networks, allowing people and devices to interact, facilitating information sharing and enabling a variety of at-tractive applications. However, face to this new paradigm, users remain suspicious and careful. They fear disclosure of their data and violation of their privacy. Without trustworthy technologies to ensure user's safe communications and trustworthy interactions, the SIoT will not reach enough popularity to be considered as a well-established technology. Accordingly, trust management becomes a major challenge to ensure reliable data analysis, qualified services and enhanced security. It helps people exceed their fears and promotes their acceptance and consumption on IoT services. However, current research still lacks a comprehensive study on trust management in SIoT. In this paper, we expose basic concepts, properties and models proposed for the trust management in SIOT environments. Furthermore, we discuss unsolved issues and future research trends.},

  Abstract                 = {Smart Buildings have been the subject of research for more than two decades. The different perspectives range from monitoring and controlling energy consumption. Indeed, energy efficiency is considered as one of the promising fields of applications of the Internet of Things. Since Smart Buildings are an important part of the smart grid, their energy efficiency is vital for the environment and global sustainability. In ubiquitous computing systems, designing Smart Building applications is a challenge since these applications must ensure a trade-off between energy consumption and occupants comfort especially in ubiquitous environments. In this paper, we focus on the design of a Smart Building application in ubiquitous computing systems. The Smart Building application is able to manage energy consumption while keeping the occupants comfort. We elaborate an illustrative scenario to demonstrate the usefulness of our work. © 2015 IEEE.},

  Abstract                 = {Automatic identification technology such as RFID promises to connect physical objects with virtual representations or even computational capabilities. However, even though RFID tags are continuously falling in price, their widespread use on consumer items is still several years away, rendering large-scale experiments with such an "internet of things" difficult. Much more ubiquitous are printed bar codes, yet so far their recognition required either specialized scanner equipment, custom-tailored bar codes or costly commercial licenses - all equally significant deployment hurdles. We have developed a freely available EAN-13 bar code recognition and information system that is both lightweight and fast enough for the use on camera-equipped mobile phones, thus significantly lowering the barrier for large-scale, real-world testing of novel information and interaction applications based on "connected" physical objects. We hope that this "low tech" version of bridging the gap will allow the community to quickly develop and try out more realistic and widespread applications, and thus gain real-world experiences for better jump-starting the future internet of things, today.},

  Abstract                 = {As we delve into the Internet of Things (IoT), we are witnessing the intensive interaction and heterogeneous communication among different devices over the Internet. Consequently, these devices generate a massive volume of Big Data. The potential of these data has been analyzed by the complex network theory, describing a specialized branch, known as 'Human Dynamics.' The potential of these data has been analyzed by the complex network theory, describing a specialized branch, known as 'Human Dynamics.' In this extension, the goal is to describe human behavior in the social area at real-time. These objectives are starting to be practicable through the quantity of data provided by smartphones, social network, and smart cities. These make the environment more intelligent and offer an intelligent space to sense our activities or actions, and the evolution of the ecosystem. To address the aforementioned needs, this paper presents the concept of 'defining human behavior' using Big Data in SIoT by proposing system architecture that processes and analyzes big data in real-time. The proposed architecture consists of three operational domains, i.e., object, SIoT server, application domain. Data from object domain is aggregated at SIoT server domain, where the data is efficiently store and process and intelligently respond to the outer stimuli. The proposed system architecture focuses on the analysis the ecosystem provided by Smart Cities, wearable devices (e.g., body area network) and Big Data to determine the human behaviors as well as human dynamics. Furthermore, the feasibility and efficiency of the proposed system are implemented on Hadoop single node setup on UBUNTU 14.04 LTS coreTMi5 machine with 3.2 GHz processor and 4 GB memory. © 2016 IEEE.},

In this paper, we describe a generalized activity recognition system, its applications, and the challenges involved in implementing the algorithm in resource-constrained devices. The distinctive aspects of our study include: 1) automatic detection and recognition of different activities (running, walking, crawling, climbing, and pronating), 2) using just one axis from an accelerometer sensor, and 3) simple features and pattern matching algorithm leading to computationally inexpensive and memory efficient system suitable for resource-constrained wearable devices. The activity recognition model was trained using data collected from 52 unique subjects.

LLNs are comprised of anything from a few dozen to thousands of routers. Supported traffic flows include point-to-point (between devices inside the LLN), point-to-multipoint (from a central control point to a subset of devices inside the LLN), and multipoint-to-point (from devices inside the LLN towards a central control point). This document specifies the IPv6 Routing Protocol for Low-Power and Lossy Networks (RPL), which provides a mechanism whereby multipoint-to-point traffic from devices inside the LLN towards a central control point as well as point-to-multipoint traffic from the central control point to the devices inside the LLN are supported.

The Internet of Things, RFID, ZigBee and Cloud computing are emerging technologies in computing, and the association between them can be used to control complex human interaction and to reduce cost and task times through connecting Smart devices to the Internet. The extraordinary growth of those technologies has made it possible to identify, locate and track objects in various environments. These technologies could allow pervasive computing systems to be more efficiently managed in terms of locating and tracking of objects in future operations. RFID technology is a non-contact identification that does not require direct line of sight to the target object. RFID is cheap (<5 p for passive tag) and reliable, but the coverage zone is limited especially for a passive tag (<11m). In the proposed system, the combination of ZigBee and RFID is designed from two aspects, firstly to provide access control and location position and secondly, to use low power output as ZigBee devices offer a larger coverage to monitor and to confirm the location of the object and continually check the position of the target objects. The proposed system uses the combination of both emerging technologies with ZigBee used to detect and locate an object and RFID used to identify the 'gate' or 'door' positions of an object at designated floor level. © 2013 ACM.},

The devices powering smart homes are systems implanted in appliances that are sensor-based and network-enabled. The possibility of accessing appliances through the Internet is referred to as the Internet of Things (IoT). A Cloud of Things (CoT) virtualizes the IoT and provides monitoring and visualization. The emerging CoT services in smart housing will enable a new generation of systems and intelligent use of a collection of applications that can be accessed in real time. Despite its benefits, CoT may also be subject to some security and privacy issues. In this paper, we propose a secure scheme for a smart house based on CoT. Our scheme defines how a connected home device is serviced from the CoT to bring it into the secure zone of the network operation infrastructure. Specifically, we illustrate how the security requirements are administered from the CoT and discuss a secure scheme for key management for smart housing. © 2014 IEEE.},

  Abstract                 = {Low-Power and Lossy Networks (LLNs) are an enabling technology for many Internet of Things (IoT) applications. To allow LLNs to interoperate with the Internet the IETF is specifying IP-compatible standards that are specifically designed for embedded devices with small memory and limited computing capabilities. The purpose of this paper is to investigate the interplay between the recently proposed IETF standard for IPv6 routing in LLNs, called RPL, with state-of-the-art autoconfiguration algorithms that assign network addresses in a hierarchical manner. To this end, we have extended the default RPL implementation available in Contiki operating system to support T-DAAP, LISAA and DAAM addressing schemes. Our experimental results clearly show that the mechanisms used by RPL to configure and maintain a tree-based network topology frequently break address hierarchy, limiting the opportunities for route aggregation. Furthermore, classical techniques used to reduce network instability significantly increase the network set-up times and, in same cases, degrade path qualities. © 2013 IEEE.},

  Abstract                 = {During the past decade, water needs have risen exponentially to an unprecedented scale in India. The demand for water supply is ever increasing and satisfying this requirement has been a major challenge for many countries around the world. Urbanization, climatic changes and wasteful usage has further depleted the resource. Water being one of the major requirements for human survival, conservation and management of the resource must be given utmost importance. Ensuring access to safe and clean water is another issue that requires attention. In this paper, we present an IPv6 network connected IoT design for real-time water flow metering and quality monitoring. Our prototype implementation uses CoAP for monitoring and control approach which supports internet based data collection. The system addresses new challenges in the water sector-ease of billing, fair billing and the need for a study of supply versus consumption of water in order to create awareness to curb water wastage and encourage its conservation. Automatic detection of leakage through any of the outlets is notified to the user. We also measure the quality of water distributed to every household by deploying pH and ORP sensors. The traditional water metering systems require periodic manual intervention for both metering and maintenance making it inconvenient and often least effective. Shortcomings of the existing models call for a ubiquitous usage of wireless systems for smart water flow metering and quality monitoring. We propose to do this with the aid of CC2538 motes programmed using ContikiOS to monitor the water consumption and communicate the data to a gateway wirelessly. © 2015 IEEE.},

Due to this menace both indoor and outdoor air quality monitoring in real time has become mandatory. Methods/Statistical Analysis: The evolution of Internet of Things (IoT) and Single Board Computers (SBC) has made real time remote monitoring as a ubiquitous process. Remote monitoring was facilitiated using classical motes in the past, which has some pitfalls like limited memory, processsing speed and complex programming strategies. This paper portrays the usage of SBC for integration of IoT with WSN for Air Quality Monitoring System (AQMS), where SBC are capable of performing even complex task with enhanced speed and reduced complexity. The integration of cloud services with SBC makes alerting process smart and realtime. Findings: With the review and realizing of immense literature in the field of WSN for air quality management, the design of sensor web node becomes essential. The evolution of SBC adds merit towards monitoring and measuring of the critical factors in centralized Air Quality Monitoring System (AQMS) in any plant. Sensor web node is proposed with commercial gas sensors for detecting the gases like CO, CO2, NH3 and NOx to monitor both indoor and outdoor air quality. The observed results are properly evaluated using ThingSpeak open source IoT platform. The integration of open source cloud services for SBC in this proposed prototype model confirms low cost, comfort, convenience and rapid prototyping for flexible AQMS. Applications/Improvements: This prototype can be easily adapted to any monitoring systems with minor changes and can be made scalable for tomorrow.},

  Abstract                 = { Wearable sensors have received considerable interest over the past decade owing to their tremendous promise for monitoring the wearers’ health, fitness, and their surroundings. However, only limited attention has been directed at developing wearable chemical sensors that offer more comprehensive information about a wearer’s well-being. The development of wearable chemical sensors faces multiple challenges on various fronts. This perspective reviews key challenges and technological gaps impeding the successful realization of effective wearable chemical sensor systems, related to materials, power, analytical procedure, communication, data acquisition, processing, and security. Size, rigidity, and operational requirements of present chemical sensors are incompatible with wearable technology. Sensor stability and on-body sensor surface regeneration constitute key analytical challenges. Similarly, present wearable power sources are incapable of meeting the requirements for wearable electronics owing to their low energy densities and slow recharging. Several energy-harvesting methodologies have inherent issues, including inconsistent power supply and limited stability. There are also major challenges pertaining to handling and securing the big data generated by wearable sensors. These include achieving high data transfer rates and efficient data mining. Efforts must also be made toward developing next generation cryptologic algorithms for ensuring data security and user privacy. The challenges facing the field of wearable chemical sensors, and wearable sensors, in general, can thus be addressed only by a multidisciplinary approach where researchers from diverse fields work in unison. The article discusses these challenges and their potential solutions along with future prospects. },

  Abstract                 = {Smartphones provide sensors and online data connectivity which makes them suitable for individual alert systems. A prototype for a car break-in alert system has been developed which can detect activity through smartphone accelerometers. The main goal of this system is to provide a low-cost alternative to expensive embedded systems with similar functionality. It can be controlled remotely solely through text messages from another mobile phone, which provides the option to use SMS instead of internet data access, in case of high cost of internet data connection (international roaming charges). In case of a detected break-in the system will send a text message to the user's second phone. The user also can query information and request the location of the vehicle. The prototype has been tested in various situations, and data have been collected to distinguish different scenarios. The system has been programmed with MIT App Inventor and will be made available for free on the Google Play Store. Copyright © 2016 by SCITEPRESS - Science and Technology Publications, Lda.

Internet of things (IoT) is an emerging scientific area with many practical applications to a vast variety of domains such as smart cities, home automation, autonomous vehicles, assistive technologies and healthcare. IoT is able to facilitate electric power management, by monitoring and controlling energy production and consumption, leading to significant savings. However, the IoT concept introduces several challenges and questions, with security, privacy and interoperability to be among them.

This paper extends the initial approaches published in [1], [2] and presents a novel cross-layer lightweight implementation to establish a secure channel. It distributes the responsibility of communication over secure channel in between the application and transport layers. Secure session establishment is performed using a payload embedded challenge response scheme over the Constrained Application Protocol (CoAP) [3]. Record encryption mechanism of Datagram Transport Layer Security (DTLS) [4] with Pre-Shared Key (PSK) [5] is used for encrypted exchange of application layer data. The secure session credentials derived from the application layer is used for encrypted exchange over the transport layer. The solution is designed in such a way that it can easily be integrated with an existing system deploying CoAP over DTLS-PSK. The proposed method is robust under different security attacks like replay attack, DoS and chosen cipher text. The improved performance of the proposed solution is established with comparative results and analysis. © 2015 IEEE.},

  Abstract                 = {The Internet of Things (IoT) is rapidly gaining ground as can be witnessed by the pervasive presence of the many things or objects around us that turn our surroundings into Intelligent Environments. These objects interact on a large scale in wired and wireless sensor and actuator networks using advanced communication protocols. Hence, IoT is an open ended and highly dynamic ecosystem with heterogeneous workloads and fluctuating resource availability. Distributed intelligence for smart objects and platforms is a vital enabling factor for IoT, but finding the best strategy to deploy and configure applications-especially those that require contextual intelligence-in a smart environment with dynamic and heterogeneous resource availability is far from straightforward. Our experiments using context-aware applications for Intelligent Environments show that many resource and performance trade-offs exist and that current deployment schemes for these kind of applications are rough around the edges. We illustrate how a modular design philosophy for smart IoT applications enables a more optimal deployments. Furthermore, we present a methodology to inspect and learn the trade-offs of different deployment schemes of IoT applications in order to autonomously optimize their configuration. We validated our methodology on different use cases and scenarios, and the results demonstrate the feasibility of our approach to automate the efficient deployment of IoT applications in the presence of multiple conflicting Quality of Service (QoS) objectives and varying runtime circumstances. © 2014-IOS Press and the authors.

  Abstract                 = {Detecting an event of interest, e.g., damage in aerospace vehicles from the continuous arriving data in Internet of Things (IoT) is challenging due to the detection quality. Traditional data mining schemes are employed to reduce data that often use metrics, association rules, and binary values for frequent patterns as indicators for finding interesting knowledge. However, these may not be directly applicable to the network due to certain constraints (communication, computation, bandwidth). We discover that, the indicators may not reveal meaningful information for event detection. In this paper, we propose a comprehensive data mining framework for event detection in IoT named DPminer, which functions in a distributed and parallel manner (data in a partitioned database processed by one or more sensor processors) and is able to extract a pattern of sensors that may have event information with a low communication cost. To achieve this, we introduce a new sensor behavioral pattern mining technique called differential sensor pattern (DSP) which considers different frequencies and values (non-binary) with a set of sensors. We present an algorithm for data preparation and then use a highly-compact data tree structure (called DP-Tree) for generating the DSP. Evaluation results show that DPminer can be very useful for networked sensing with a superior performance in terms of communication cost and detection quality compared to existing data mining schemes. © 2016 IEEE.},

  Abstract                 = {With the emergence of the Internet of Things and improvement of humans' living standards, smart home is becoming the future criterion of home life. Smart home not only gives users a safe, healthy and comfortable living environment, but also allows users to remotely monitor their home state and control home appliances. However, the current smart home systems, including home gateways, wireless sensor network devices and the home networking equipments require constant work. This will not only cause a waste of energy, still can negatively affect the gateway performance. In order to save energy and reduce the cost of smart home, there is a pressing need for a new type of intelligent home control system. This paper presents a new type of intelligent home control system, using Android Phone as a temporary home gateway instead of the default home gateway, thus reducing the constant working hours of the traditional gateway. At the same time, we also construct an intelligent control system based on user behavior analysis, the system will automatically shut down the unused devices by predicting user behavior, so as to achieve energy savings and reduce costs. © 2011 IEEE.},

  Abstract                 = {This paper is based on two fundamental assumptions about a future Internet of Things (IoT): i) The amount of wireless, resource-constrained devices will outnumber the amount of devices in the current internet by several orders of magnitude and ii) those devices will be connected to the Internet over multi-hop wireless links. We argue that the experimental validation in testbeds is imperative to make those networks robust. However, there are only limited means to support researchers in ``debugging'' the actual communication on the wireless medium and often developers can only guess why their protocols don't work in a given environment. In this paper, we present such a framework which extends the WISEBED testbed federation. Our contribution allows an easy-to-use browser-based experimentation and evaluation of wireless multi-hop protocols in all WISEBED-compatible testbeds (nine testbeds with  1000 sensor nodes and the SmartSantander [17] smart city testbed which will offer up to 20,000 IoT devices). Using a generic packet tracking framework for multiple platforms, researchers can easily detect hotspots and bottlenecks in the network and follow the routes of individual packets as they are forwarded. Experiment configurations can be shared on the web so that experiments can easily be repeated to verify published results. We demonstrate the usability of our approach by means of a real-world use-case.},

  Abstract                 = {This paper discusses the possibility of recognizing and predicting user activities in the IoT (Internet of Things) based smart environment. The activity recognition is usually done through two steps: activity pattern clustering and activity type decision. Although many related works have been suggested, they had some limited performance because they focused only on one part between the two steps. This paper tries to find the best combination of a pattern clustering method and an activity decision algorithm among various existing works. For the first step, in order to classify so varied and complex user activities, we use a relevant and efficient unsupervised learning method called the K-pattern clustering algorithm. In the second step, the training of smart environment for recognizing and predicting user activities inside his/her personal space is done by utilizing the artificial neural network based on the Allen’s temporal relations. The experimental results show that our combined method provides the higher recognition accuracy for various activities, as compared with other data mining classification algorithms. Furthermore, it is more appropriate for a dynamic environment like an IoT based smart home. © 2015 by the authors; licensee MDPI, Basel, Switzerland.},

For anonymity tags use pseudonyms that are refreshed with every interrogation (whether completed or not). For forward secrecy, the state of tags must be updated and it must be hard to reverse updates. Since the interrogating reader can be adversarial, the adversary may control state updates. It follows that it may not be possible for tags to maintain synchrony with authorized readers. In this letter we analyze a recently proposed RFID protocol and show that there is a fundamental trade-off between privacy and availability. We prove that for lightweight RFID applications strong privacy cannot be achieved in the presence of a Byzantine adversary. © 2012 IEEE.},

Emerging standards such as 6LoWPAN/IPv6 and CoRE/CoAP will play a very important role in a Restful Web of Things, where each node has its own IPv6 address and is able to provide information and control about itself. Data exchanging in Machine To Machine (M2M) applications and communication with Web services require the use of structured data. XML is a possible solution, but its verbosity is not suitable for a WSN (e.g. based on IEEE 802.15.4) characterized by limited packet size. This paper investigates the benefits of Efficient XML Interchange (EXI) in a real scenario, considering sensor nodes running on the Contiki RTOS. For this purpose, the authors have implemented an extremely lightweight version of EXI for Contiki running on application boards with just 8 Kbyte RAM memory. © 2012 IEEE.},

  Abstract                 = {The Web of Things (WoT) aims to extend the Web into the physical world by promoting the adoption of Web protocols by situated services and smart objects (ambient artifacts). However, real-world ambient artifacts often adopt proprietary and/or non-Web protocols, making them invisible to Web search engines and inaccessible to conventional Web agents. Smart Gateways have been proposed as a way to "Web-enable" proprietary ambient artifacts through intermediary proxy nodes, however, the requisite infrastructure is difficult to deploy at Web scale. To address such challenges, we are developing Ambient Dynamix (Dynamix): a plug-and-play context framework for mobile devices, which enables Web agents to interoperate with non-Web ambient artifacts - directly from the browser. In this paper, we describe how Dynamix can be used to transform the user's device into an ad-hoc Smart Gateway in-situ, enabling Web applications (in the device's browser) to seamlessly interact with non-Web ambient artifacts in the physical environment. We describe an operational prototype implementation, which enables Web apps to discover and control nearby UPnP and AirPlay media devices uniformly. We also present a performance evaluation that indicates the prototype imposes low processing and memory overhead, and is suitable for deployment on many commodity mobile devices. © 2013 IEEE.},

  Abstract                 = {In this paper we address the design of network architectures for the Internet of Things by proposing practical algorithms to augment IETF CoAP/6LoWPAN protocol stacks with congestion control functionalities. Our design is inspired by previous theoretical work on back pressure routing and is targeted toward Web-based architectures featuring bidirectional data flows made up of CoAP request/response pairs. Here, we present three different cross-layer and fully decentralized congestion control schemes and compare them against ideal back pressure and current UDP-based protocol stacks. Hence, we discuss results obtained using ns-3 through an extensive simulation campaign for two different scenarios: unidirectional and upstream flows and bidirectional Web-based CoAP flows. Our results confirm that the proposed congestion control algorithms perform satisfactorily in both scenarios for a wide range of values of their configuration parameters, and are amenable to the implementation onto existing protocol stacks for embedded sensor devices. © 2013 Elsevier B.V.},

  Abstract                 = {A future Internet of Things (IoT) system will connect the physical world into cyberspace everywhere and everything via billions of smart objects. On the one hand, IoT devices are physically connected via communication networks. The service oriented architecture (SOA) can provide interoperability among heterogeneous IoT devices in physical networks. On the other hand, IoT devices are virtually connected via social networks. In this paper we propose adaptive and scalable trust management to support service composition applications in SOA-based IoT systems. We develop a technique based on distributed collaborative filtering to select feedback using similarity rating of friendship, social contact, and community of interest relationships as the filter. Further we develop a novel adaptive filtering technique to determine the best way to combine direct trust and indirect trust dynamically to minimize convergence time and trust estimation bias in the presence of malicious nodes performing opportunistic service and collusion attacks. For scalability, we consider a design by which a capacity-limited node only keeps trust information of a subset of nodes of interest and performs minimum computation to update trust. We demonstrate the effectiveness of our proposed trust management through service composition application scenarios with a comparative performance analysis against EigenTrust and PeerTrust.},

  Abstract                 = {The technologies of Internet of things have been widely applied in the agricultural environmental monitoring in recent years, while multiple transmission networks have been deployed to obtain environmental information. The gateway of internet of things was used for heterogeneous networks access and transmission of data protocol among the networks. In order to realize the unified management of heterogeneous networks that were used for greenhouse environment, an intelligent gateway with Exynos4412 as the core processor was developed, which has high speed operation capability and can be expanded for various communication module interfaces. Correspondingly, an application program worked in the gateway based on Android system was designed, which realized the management process of heterogeneous networks as following: Firstly, on the gateway display interface, user configured the information of the gateway communicating interface, data acquisition unit, and phase description of the sensors data stream. Secondly, the gateway application program established an information configuration file based on XML. Thirdly, after the application program was running again, according to the data stream description in XML configuration file, the gateway program matched the received data stream byte by byte segment in the data receiving tread, then positioned the sensor data in the data stream, parsed and converted the original value to the real value of the monitoring parameter. Fourthly, the data relation between keyword and value was composed to a map and was stored in the SQLite database. Lastly, the data access interface was provided for upper module such as real time data query module and historical data query module. The system was deployed in greenhouse and started running since December 18, 2014, to test three kinds of heterogeneous networks for Zigbee, RS-485 and Wi-Fi. The Zigbee network was used to collect air temperature, air humidity, light intensity, CO2 concentration, soil moisture inside the greenhouse, and data was transmitted to a Zigbee aggregation unit that was linked to the gateway by Serial line. The RS-485 network was used to collect the meteorological information outside the greenhouse such as wind direction, air temperature, air humidity, wind speed, rainfall, UVI, light intensity, and data was transmitted to a 485/232 conversion module which linked to the gateway by Serial line. The Wi-Fi network was used to collect the greenhouse image data from the camera, and data was transmitted wirelessly to the Wi-Fi module in the gateway by using a wireless router. In the gateway application program, the heterogeneous networks channel properties and sensors data protocol was not fixed in the software code, but was configured by user on the interface, also the storage and display of monitoring parameters was synchronous with the configuration. Thus, the application program can save developing time when the system was deployed for similar greenhouse environment monitoring or the nodes in the networks were changed for different use. The running results for at least 14 days showed that the intelligent gateway had corresponded the analysis, storage and display of monitoring parameters to the configuration information. Various monitoring parameters of heterogeneous networks data had been stored, and environmental monitoring data can be updated accurately and history data record can be query accurately on the displaying interface of the gateway. The application model of the system was of good stability and can be further extended to more heterogeneous networks. ©, 2015, Chinese Society of Agricultural Engineering. All right reserved.},

  Abstract                 = {A smart home is a home environment enriched with sensing, actuation, communication and computation capabilities which permits to adapt it to inhabitants preferences and requirements. Establishing a proper strategy of actuation on the home environment can require complex computational tasks on the sensed data. This is the case of activity recognition, which consists in retrieving high-level knowledge about what occurs in the home environment and about the behaviour of the inhabitants. The inherent complexity of this application domain asks for tools able to properly support the design and implementation phases. This paper proposes a framework for the design and implementation of smart home applications focused on activity recognition in home environments. The framework mainly relies on the Cloud-assisted Agent-based Smart home Environment (CASE) architecture offering basic abstraction entities which easily allow to design and implement Smart Home applications. CASE is a three layered architecture which exploits the distributed multi-agent paradigm and the cloud technology for offering analytics services. Details about how to implement activity recognition onto the CASE architecture are supplied focusing on the low-level technological issues as well as the algorithms and the methodologies useful for the activity recognition. The effectiveness of the framework is shown through a case study consisting of a daily activity recognition of a person in a home environment. © 2016, Springer Science+Business Media New York.},

While being completely passive, it conjugates identification, sensing, local computing, and actuation control and enables a proactive communication with any standard RFID reader. Thanks to an accurate electromagnetic design and exploiting polarization diversity of two antennas performing both energy harvesting and communication, SPARTACUS ensures compactness, energy-efficiency, and ease of use.

Different technologies such as Network Functions Virtualization (NFV) and Software Defined Networking (SDN) are being considered to address the future needs of 5G networks. However, future applications such as Internet of Things (IoT), video services and others still unveiled will have different requirements, which emphasize the need for the dynamic scalability of the network functionality. The means for efficient network resource operability seems to be even more important than the future network element costs. This paper provides the analysis of different technologies such as SDN and NFV that offer different architectural options to address the needs of 5G networks. The options under consideration in this paper may differ mainly in the extent of what SDN principles are applied to mobile specific functions or to transport network functions only. © 2015 IEEE.},

Since the energy harvesting process does not match the real energy demand, sensor nodes suffer from occasional energy shortages, especially when they serve as cluster head (CH) nodes. To address this problem, we propose a cluster-based routing protocol referred to as distance-And-energy-Aware routing with energy reservation (DEARER). The DEARER protocol encourages nodes with high energy-Arrival rate or being close to the sink to serve as CH nodes. Also, DEARER allows non-CH nodes to reserve a portion of the harvested energy for future use. In doing so, the DEARER selects 'enabler' nodes as CH nodes and provides them with more energy, thereby mitigating the energy shortage events at CH nodes. By theoretical analysis and numerical experiments, we demonstrate that the DEARER protocol outperforms direct transmission and also approaches the genie-Aided routing, where CH nodes are selected based on the real-Time energy information of each node. © 1983-2012 IEEE.},

  Abstract                 = {Time slotted operation is a well-proven approach to achieve highly-reliable low-power networking through scheduling and channel hopping. It is, however, difficult to apply time slotting to dynamic networks as envisioned in the Internet of Things. Commonly, these applications do not have predefined periodic traffic patterns and nodes can be added or removed dynamically. This paper addresses the challenge of bringing TSCH (Time Slotted Channel Hopping MAC) to such dynamic networks. We focus on low-power IPv6 and RPL networks, and introduce Orchestra. In Orchestra, nodes autonomously compute their own, local schedules. They maintain multiple schedules, each allocated to a particular traffic plane (application, routing, MAC), and updated automatically as the topology evolves. Orchestra (re)computes local schedules without signaling overhead, and does not require any central or distributed scheduler. Instead, it relies on the existing network stack information to maintain the schedules. This scheme allows Orchestra to build non-deterministic networks while exploiting the robustness of TSCH. We demonstrate the practicality of Orchestra and quantify its benefits through extensive evaluation in two testbeds, on two hardware platforms. Orchestra reduces, or even eliminates, network contention. In long running experiments of up to 72 h we show that Orchestra achieves end-to-end delivery ratios of over 99.99%. Compared to RPL in asynchronous low-power listening networks, Orchestra improves reliability by two orders of magnitude, while achieving a similar latency-energy balance.},

  Abstract                 = {The Internet-of-Things (IoT) envisions a world where billions of everyday objects and mobile devices communicate using a large number of interconnected wired and wireless networks. Maximizing the utilization of this paradigm requires fine-grained QoS support for differentiated application requirements, context-aware semantic information retrieval, and quick and easy deployment of resources, among many other objectives. These objectives can only be achieved if components of the IoT can be dynamically managed end-to-end across heterogeneous objects, transmission technologies, and networking architectures. Software-defined Networking (SDN) is a new paradigm that provides powerful tools for addressing some of these challenges. Using a software-based control plane, SDNs introduce significant flexibility for resource management and adaptation of network functions. In this article, we study some promising solutions for the IoT based on SDN architectures. Particularly, we analyze the application of SDN in managing resources of different types of networks such as Wireless Sensor Networks (WSN) and mobile networks, the utilization of SDN for information-centric networking, and how SDN can leverage Sensing-as-a-Service (SaaS) as a key cloud application in the IoT.},

Sensing technologies are promising solutions that can provide cost-effective answers to these challenges. In this paper, we focus on long-term in-house activity monitoring that aims at early detection and prevention of such conditions. In this context, we present and experimentally evaluate an ultra low-power (less than 100- μW long-term average power consumption) on-body activity sensing prototype system that is based on Bluetooth low energy (BLE). As part of a larger smart home monitoring architecture, the role of the presented system is to collect and reliably deliver acceleration data to the upper layers of the architecture. The system evaluation incorporates a thorough power consumption study that facilitates meaningful battery lifetime estimations, an insightful coverage study in an actual residential environment, and the investigation of energy-efficient packet loss mitigation techniques. © 2016, Fafoutis et al.},

  Abstract                 = {To achieve energy self-sufficiency in housing, it is necessary to know the capacity of microgeneration of systems and the real needs of consumption of the users. Each house includes a microgeneration system based on the use of sustainable energy. In theoretical conditions, the design is capable of satisfying entirely its energy needs. However in real conditions there are situations in which it is necessary more energy, and others on the contrary, it produces more energy than necessary. This paper proposes the use of context-aware paradigm that integrate ubiquitous sensor network for the optimization of the energy resource available. The goal is to achieve the maximum energy efficiency during the distribution, in real time and according to energy demand in housings and community equipments. Using context-aware paradigm the system obtains environmental information, determines the profile of consumption of the users and calculates the instantaneous energy needs. This information is obtained from ubiquitous networks and will be used by systems of distribution of the electrical grid of the group of housings. Different paradigms of communication are used that provides the necessary support to achieve near real time. These paradigms are based on the protocols used in the development of the Internet of things.},

Moreover, the potential of analytics methods for discovering activity recognition in such environment has been investigated. CASE easily allows to implement Smart Home applications exploiting a distributed multi-agent system and the cloud technology. The work is mainly focused on activity recognition albeit CASE architecture permits an easy integration of other kinds of smart home applications such as home automation and energy optimization. The CASE effectiveness is shown through the design of a case study consisting of a daily activity recognition of an elder person in its home environment.},

  Abstract                 = {In this paper, a newly developed experimental test system for electromagnetic interference (EMI) due to Radio Frequency Identification (RFID) reader/writers on medical devices is introduced and the basic design concept is discussed. The aim of this research is to establish an EMI estimation method using FDTD analysis and a measurement system to obtain precise and detailed EMI characteristics regarding RFID EMI on medical devices. Practical situations of EMI due to existing RFID reader/writers on medical devices is investigated and ways to prevent this EMI are currently discussed by some organizations. In addition, more detailed investigations need to be carried out such as the effects of the three-dimensional electromagnetic fields (EMF) containing human body of actual environments. Furthermore, it is required to design an experiment system with minimum measurement errors. The EMI test experiments on 13 types of implantable pacemakers and defibrillators were carried out to validate the fundamental performance of the test system.},

  Abstract                 = {Monitoring different parameters of interest in a crop has been proven as a useful tool to improve agricultural production. Crop monitoring in precision agriculture may be achieved by a multiplicity of technologies; however the use of Wireless Sensor Networks (WSNs) results in low-cost and low-power consumption deployments, therefore becoming a dominant option. It is also well-known that crops are also negatively affected by intruders (human or animals) and by insufficient control of the production process. Video-surveillance is a solution to detect and identify intruders as well as to better take care of the production process. In this paper, a new platform called Integrated WSN Solution for Precision Agriculture is proposed. The only cost-effective technology employed is IEEE 802.15.4, and it efficiently integrates crop data acquisition, data transmission to the end-user and video-surveillance tasks. This platform has been evaluated for the particular scenario of scattered crops video-surveillance by using computer simulation and analysis. The telecommunications metrics of choice are energy consumed, probability of frame collision and end-to-end latency, which have been carefully studied to offer the most appropriate wireless network operation. Wireless node prototypes providing agriculture data monitoring, motion detection, camera sensor and long distance data transmission (in the order of several kilometers) are developed. The performance evaluation of this real tests-bed scenario demonstrates the feasibility of the platform designed and confirms the simulation and analytical results.},

BLE represents a trade-off between energy consumption, latency, piconet size, and throughput that mainly depends on parameters such as connInterval and connSlaveLatency. According to theoretical results, the lifetime of a BLE device powered by a coin cell battery ranges between 2.0 days and 14.1 years. The number of simultaneous slaves per master ranges between 2 and 5,917. The minimum latency for a master to obtain a sensor reading is 676 μs, although simulation results show that, under high bit error rate, average latency increases by up to three orders of magnitude. The paper provides experimental results that complement the theoretical and simulation findings, and indicates implementation constraints that may reduce BLE performance. © 2012 by the authors; licensee MDPI, Basel, Switzerland.},

The efficiency of these techniques can be largely improved exploiting information on the status of the network, such as that used by routing protocols. In particular, one of the most used protocol in Internet of Things (IoT) scenarios is the IPv6 Routing Protocol for Low power and lossy networks (RPL). In this paper, we propose a redundant distributed data storage and retrieval mechanism to increase the resilience and storage capacity of a RPL-based WSN against local memory shortage. We evaluate our approach in the Contiki operating system through extensive analysis with the Cooja simulator. © 2013 IEEE.},

In fact, the cloudlet concept is a subset of edge computing applied to mobile networks and the fog concept is a subset of edge computing applied to Internet of Things (IoT). This paper demystifies these concepts and provides a comprehensive survey of references from academia and industry. It analyzes the terminology and dimensions of performance, security, and governance, based on a taxonomy proposed and presented in the paper. In addition we provide a thorough analysis of related topics, identifying the main research areas correlated to edge computing.

This offers the ability to measure, infer and understand environmental indicators, from delicate ecologies and natural resources to urban environments. The proliferation of these devices in a communicating-actuating network creates the Internet of Things (IoT), wherein sensors and actuators blend seamlessly with the environment around us, and the information is shared across platforms in order to develop a common operating picture (COP). Fueled by the recent adaptation of a variety of enabling wireless technologies such as RFID tags and embedded sensor and actuator nodes, the IoT has stepped out of its infancy and is the next revolutionary technology in transforming the Internet into a fully integrated Future Internet. As we move from www (static pages web) to web2 (social networking web) to web3 (ubiquitous computing web), the need for data-on-demand using sophisticated intuitive queries increases significantly. This paper presents a Cloud centric vision for worldwide implementation of Internet of Things. The key enabling technologies and application domains that are likely to drive IoT research in the near future are discussed. A Cloud implementation using Aneka, which is based on interaction of private and public Clouds is presented. We conclude our IoT vision by expanding on the need for convergence of WSN, the Internet and distributed computing directed at technological research community. © 2013 Elsevier B.V.

It enables information forwarding and dissemination within and among the opportunistic communities formed based on the movement and opportunistic contact nature of human. We characterize the bi-directional effects between human and opportunistic IoT, discuss the technical challenges faced by this new research field, and propose a reference architecture for developing opportunistic IoT systems.

To meet these demands, drastic improvements need to be made in cellular network architecture. This paper presents the results of a detailed survey on the fifth generation (5G) cellular network architecture and some of the key emerging technologies that are helpful in improving the architecture and meeting the demands of users. In this detailed survey, the prime focus is on the 5G cellular network architecture, massive multiple input multiple output technology, and device-to-device communication (D2D). Along with this, some of the emerging technologies that are addressed in this paper include interference management, spectrum sharing with cognitive radio, ultra-dense networks, multi-radio access technology association, full duplex radios, millimeter wave solutions for 5G cellular networks, and cloud technologies for 5G radio access networks and software defined networks. In this paper, a general probable 5G cellular network architecture is proposed, which shows that D2D, small cell access points, network cloud, and the Internet of Things can be a part of 5G cellular network architecture.

In this study, a system is designed to continuously monitor the Electrocardiogram (ECG) and other vital parameters. This data is stored in a database and can be displayed in a website that can be accessed only by authorized personnel. This idea is familiar however; this paper presents a substantive and inexpensive method using Raspberry pi. The primary task of this system is to update the data to the database and alert the doctors for any aberrancy. The former is accomplished by using MySQLdb module to link Raspberry pi to the database whereas the latter is achieved by the combination of Raspberry Pi and GSM module. This system has much future scope as the data gathered by monitoring is so valuable and can be used for scientific research by the medical community. By determining the patterns in the parameters observed, the nature of disease can be predicted. The paper mainly emphasizes on the system design and the algorithm used to accomplish the task. The obtained results are presented.},

Our proposal targets an alarming spot in the fast growing IoT industry where security is often overlooked due to device limitation, budget constraint, and development deadline. In contrast to existing host-centric and hardwarecoupled solutions, Securebox empowers a cloud-assisted model that is dedicated to budget and resource constrained IoT environments. Owing to its cloud-driven and modular design, Securebox allows us to 1) flexibly offload and onload security and management functions to the cloud and network edge components; 2) offer advanced security and management services to end users in an affordable and on-demand manner; 3) ease the upgrade and deployment of new services to guard against abrupt security breakouts. To demonstrate Securebox, we have implemented the platform consisting of a plug-n-play frontend, a Kubernetes-powered backend cluster, and a smartphone mobile application. Based on the testbed evaluation, we show that Securebox is robust and responsive. Its collaborative and extensible architecture enforces rapid update cycles and can scale with the growing diversity of IoT devices. © 2016 ACM.},

  Abstract                 = {Emerging practical deployments for the Internet of Things (IoT) trigger a need to integrate and inter-operate a variety of heterogenous networks to realize real business values. Several applications require the integration of wireless sensor networks (WSN), WiFi, and Radio Frequency Identifiers (RFID) into one single network to fulfil business requirements. As most of such deployments are characterized as being large-scale and heterogeneous, special algorithms and techniques are needed in order to deal with data collection, processing, and transmission in such networks. Results reported in the literature confirm that clustering techniques can be very efficient in dealing with routing in large-scale networks. However; due to the heterogeneity of IoT networks, the use of conventional clustering techniques may not result in an efficient clustering. Accordingly, in this paper, we attempt to address this problem by studying the use of evolutionary clustering algorithms in integrated WSN-RFID networks. In particular, the performance of two evolutionary algorithms; namely the Genetic Algorithms (GA) and the Harmony Search (HS), is analyzed and compared. It is shown that, the GA outperforms the HS significantly in the cluster formation process for integrated WSN-RFID networks. © 2016 ACM.},

However, existing device-free solutions mainly use sensors and active RFID tags, which are much more expensive compared to passive tags. In this paper, we propose a novel motion detection and tracking method using passive RFID tags, named Twins. The method leverages a phenomenon called critical state caused by interference among passive tags. We theoretically explain this phenomenon via an interference model and conduct extensive experiment to validate it. We design a practical Twins based intrusion detection system and implement a real prototype with commercial off-the-shelf reader and tags. Experimental results show that Twins is effective in detecting the moving object, with low location errors of 0.75m in average. © 2014 IEEE.},

  Abstract                 = {A novel portable fluorometer combining the attributes of a smartphone with an easy-fit, simple and compact sample chamber fabricated using 3-D printing has been developed for pH measurements of environmental water in the field. A color filter attached over the camera white light light-emitting diode selects an excitation band centered around \lambda \sim 450 nm with a 3-dB bandwidth, \Delta \lambda \sim 21 nm. An application-specific, temperature-stable probe based on the 4-aminonaphthalimide fluorophore was synthesized to absorb at this wavelength while emitting in the green region of the visible spectrum. The green emission is readily detected using the smartphone camera and a simple red-green-blue Android application. Suppression of the green emission increases with increasing pH enabling a straightforward pH sensor. The system was calibrated against a commercial spectrofluorometer and pH measurements were taken at various locations around Sydney. The results were then compared directly with those obtained using conventional electrode-based measurements. The data can be stored in the phone's available memory or transmitted by phone back to base for further real-time analysis. © 2001-2012 IEEE.},

The interconnection with the real-world, in industrial and critical environments, requires reaction in real-time. Therefore, real-time will be a vertical requirement from communication to Big Data analytics. Big Data for CPS requires on the one hand, real-time streams processing for real-time control, and on the other hand, batch processing for modeling and behaviors learning.

  Abstract                 = {{Diabetes therapy management in AAL environments, such as old people and diabetes patients homes, is a very difficult task since many factors affect a patient's blood sugar levels. Factors such as illness, treatments, physical and psychological stress, physical activity, drugs, intravenous fluids and change in the meal plan cause unpredictable and potentially dangerous fluctuations in blood sugar levels. Right now, operations related to dosage are based on insulin infusion protocol boards, which are provided by physicians to the patients. These boards are not considering very influential factors such as glycemic index from the diet, consequently patients need to estimate the dosage leading to dose error, which culminates in hyperglycemia and hypoglycemia episode. Therefore, right insulin infusion calculation needs to be supported by the next generation of personal-care devices. For this reason, a personal device has been developed to assist and consider more factors in the insulin therapy dosage calculation. The proposed solution is based on Internet of things in order to, on the one hand, support a patient's profile management architecture based on personal RFID cards and, on the other hand, provide global connectivity between the developed patient's personal device based on 6LoWPAN, nurses/physicians desktop application to manage personal health cards, glycemic index information system, and patient's web portal. This solution has been evaluated by a multidisciplinary group formed by patients, physicians, and nurses.}},

This objective is achieved by the analysis of physiological signals in conjunction with body position. The physiological signals that are analyzed are galvanic skin resistance and body temperature. Body position is determined by acquiring raw accelerometer data from a triple axis accelerometer. Acquisition of raw data is then followed by activity recognition which is a process of employing a specialized machine learning algorithm. Real-time monitoring of data is achieved by wirelessly sending sensor data to an open source Cloud Platform. Analysis of the data is done on MATLAB simultaneously. This device is programmed to continuously monitor the subject's parameters and take action when any dangerous situation presents itself. It does so by detecting the change in the monitored signals, following which appropriate action is taken by means of sending notifications/alerts to designated individuals.},

This type of services will become an integral part of a generic IoT operational platform for smart cities due to its pure business-oriented features. A high-level view of the proposed middleware is outlined and the corresponding operational platform is illustrated. To demonstrate the provision of car parking services, based on the proposed middleware, a cloud-based intelligent car parking system for use within a university campus is described along with details of its design, implementation, and operation. A number of software solutions, including Kafka/Storm/Hbase clusters, OSGi web applications with distributed NoSQL, a rule engine, and mobile applications, are proposed to provide 'best' car parking service experience to mobile users, following the Always Best Connected and best Served (ABC&S) paradigm. © 2014 by the authors; licensee MDPI, Basel, Switzerland.},

  Abstract                 = {Development of electronic technologies shows a general tendency towards miniaturization manifested subsequently in mobility and ability to process larger amounts of information. It is mostly mobile technologies and devices interlinked by internet (internet of things), which contribute to an exponential growth of electronic information and its use. A similar trend is noticeable within in education with growing utilization of electronic forms. In that area we may discern further development of e-learning by means of mobile applications where new opportunities for dynamic presentation of study content and adaptation to the mobility of stakeholders of the educational process keep opening up. Multiple modern technologies and methods improving the flexibility of education have already been employed in e-learning. The use of augmented reality, enabling mobile access to information, belongs among the most advanced technologies in the area of elearning, promising to shape its future. Extensive amount of information about objects surrounding us presents the main benefit of such technology. Information is obtained by means of adequate tools that are, due to mobile devices proliferating among both students and teachers, frequent enough. They include smart phones, tablets etc., possessing a kind of "intellect", i.e. They are capable of processing information and contain mobile internet connection. Communication by means of iBeacon low-energy Bluetooth transmitters distributed at various educational interest points belongs among those interesting technologies which facilitate augmented reality. In our research, we investigated and subsequently tested the possibility of spreading e-learning by its means, and assessed its potential to reach the target audience more effectively within the augmented reality. Our findings show that the character of distributed knowledge differs from the traditional e-learning in dynamic perception of information which is divided into particular interest points, using iBeacon devices. Another advantage is the flexible use of that technology while teaching outside, in a laboratory etc. In the proposed paper we developed, based on the results of our research, a model of an interesting e-learning study method describing the implementation of iBeacon technology. The use of the technology is proposed not only from the perspective of its implementation in suitable study courses but also involving the communication methods between lecturers and students. The proposed model is supported by a description of a student sample group completing an e-learning course on Product and Quality by means of that new technology.},

  Abstract                 = {The Internet-of-Things (IoT) is a paradigm that connects devices and objects through the network to share information. Recently, the IoT-based healthcare services are considered as one of the crucial services. However, the existing IoT technology, such as Bluetooth and ISO/IEEE 11073 standard, is not suitable for providing IoT-based healthcare services because it does not support the Internet Protocol (IP). Moreover, the oneM2M standard does not support the IoT-based healthcare services. In this paper, we propose a new architecture of ISO/IEEE 11073-based IoT healthcare services. The proposed architecture can support IP communication using IPv6 over Low power Wireless Personal Area Energy (6LoWPAN) technology in the Bluetooth Low Energy (BLE) network. We also use the Constrained Application Protocol (CoAP) to provide more efficient communication for constrained devices. For validation of the proposed architecture, we implemented the ISO/IEEE 11073-based healthcare services using 6LoWPAN and BLE. We also performed testbed experimentation. In addition, for evaluation of the associated protocols, we compare the transmission delay between CoAP and HTTP. From the results, we see that CoAP is more efficient than HTTP for the IoT healthcare services. © 2016 IEEE.},

Cloud computing and IoT are presently two most important ICT models that are shaping the next generation of computing. Both concepts have major impact on how we build and deploy smart applications/solutions for smart cities. Cloud computing represents the delivery of hardware and software resources on demand over the Internet-as-a-service. On the other hand, IoT concept envisions a new generation of devices (sensors, both virtual and physical) that are connected to the Internet and provide different services for value-added applications.

In the field of development the laboratory work generally focuses on the Auto-ID area, specifically on the Internet of Things. Thus students gain knowledge and skills of usage of RFID technologies and learn how to utilize these technologies in real enterprises. The actual practical workshops consist of several parts. Various subjects integrate practical tasks in accordance with annotations of these subjects. For these subjects suitable practical tasks are constructed adequately to a suitable grade. Inclusion is therefore a cross-section of different subjects in different bachelor and master programs. For example, students of the first year of bachelor study in the subject of "Informatics" solve tasks representing the principle of RFID technology. For comparison, 2nd year students of master's program in the subject of "Packaging and Identification" solve laboratory tasks in practical exercises such as proposal of the most advantageous location of RFID tag on the trade and consumer units with regard to measurement of their readability and further processing of EPC in information systems. © SGEM2015.},

A unique aspect of our research is personalized individual stress analysis including three stress levels: low, medium and high. Using machine learning algorithms from the ECG signals alone, we could achieve 88.24% accuracy in detecting the three classes of stress. We also find that high stress can be successfully detected for a person in comparison to his or her rest period with 100% accuracy. © 2015 IEEE.},

Knowledge discovery in data streams is valuable task for research, business and community. The fundamental step of knowledge discovery in data stream is the classification of the data streams in target classes. In this paper we have proposed classification mechanism for the data streams, conventional classification algorithm are of little significance in data streams due to the complex nature, unbounded memory requirements and concept drifting problem in data streams. The proposed method takes a novel approach towards the classification of the data streams through applying unsupervised classification techniques such as clustering followed by supervised classifier such as Support Vector Machine. The high volume data is sampled and reduced with Simple Aggregation and Approximation (SAX) Density based clustering algorithm DB Scan is applied on the data stream to reveal the number of classes present and subsequently label the data. Support vector Machine (SVM) is a well-known and proven supervised classification algorithm, SVM are applied to classify the label data. We tested our proposed method on the Intel Lab Data set, a data set of four environmental variables (Temperature, Voltage, Humidity, light) collected through 54 Mica2Dot sensors over 36 Days at per second rate. We have sampled the data stream in days and window of certain size n is trained on the SVM classifier. The algorithm is evaluated on different test size and average accuracy of 80% is obtained. © 2014 IEEE.},

  Abstract                 = {The modern data centers (DCs) are essential to fulfilling ever-evolving computational demands around cloud computing, big data, and IT infrastructure. These DCs are facilities (Figure 1) that house computer systems and associated components such as networking and storage systems. To operate a DC, power supplies, network connections, environmental controls (e.g., air conditioning, humidity), and security infrastructure are needed. Technology and business challenges such as virtualization, load consolidation, real-time troubleshooting, and service-level guarantees require a robust and adaptive server management plan for enterprise. The majority of DC issues are related to overutilization of resources, application failures, data security, power usage effectiveness (PUE), and infrastructure costs. This requires proactive solutions that are business intelligent and built over a network of sense points that are guaranteed to deliver reliable trends and measurements in a reliable and timely fashion. Since it is expensive to build new DCs, the best option is to improve usage of an existing facility through lower infrastructure overhead to deliver better resource management. An optimal sensor network would perform real-time sensor-data collection and deliver a) improved server rack utilization, b) improved DC cooling, and c) improved loadbalancing through dynamic capping of thermally constrained systems.},

  Abstract                 = {The interaction between devices sharing the same frequency domain, but using different communication protocols, is an important issue prevalent to the Internet of Things (IoT). IEEE 802.11 and IEEE 802.15.4, protocols that overlap in applications such as home automation, health care and factory automation, is one such example. In these situations 802.11 networks are known to detrimentally interfere with 802.15.4 networks, degrading performance significantly. We show that the response to unsuccessful Clear Channel Assessments (CCA) is a large contributor to this degradation. Current responses do not distinguish between different transmission sources, employing the same response independent of the interferer type. However, as we show in this paper, it is beneficial to discriminate interferer types when performing CCA as this allows us to employ different strategies in handling occupied media. Our work considers in particular the low-power Medium Access Control (MAC) protocols based on the 802.15.4 standard. In such protocols, CCA is applied at the transmitter to arbitrate channel access, and also at the receiver for power efficient transmission detection. We present a protocol building block called Differentiating Clear Channel Assessment (DCCA) which allows us to tailor the reaction to a busy channel depending on the nature of the interfering network type. We evaluate an implementation of DCCA for the ContikiMAC protocol on the Maxfor MTM-CM5000MSP platform. The experimental evaluation shows that DCCA improves throughput of 802.15.4 networks in the presence of 802.11 networks significantly, ten-fold in some settings. © 2014 IEEE.},

  Abstract                 = {We live at a time when the automotive industry is going through a technological revolution with the development of vehicles changing into autonomous moving objects having the properties of artificial intelligence. Additionally, cellular communications networks introduce new technologies and concepts: SDN (Software-defined networking), NFV (Network Functions Virtualization). These advanced software-defined communications networks virtualize network functions, allowing a new way of configuration, control and management. Increasing the speed and automation are key requirements to support the most demanding services such as mobile payment of contextual services, as well as the introduction of new Machine users. SDN also assists in the implementation of new infrastructure for the dynamic services that are based on the concepts of IoT, Big Data and Everything-as-a-Service. Using NFV enables the Internet of Things services that provide a new way of connecting people, processes, data and devices. It is precisely these requirements that are essential for the introduction of C-ITS systems, i.e., the integration of passengers, drivers, vehicles and transport infrastructure, as well as information, statistics, predictive traffic analytics, all this in real-time. Due to this trend of development of cellular communications networks in the next 5G communications networks, automotive and ITS traffic systems are becoming the most important market for business expansion of telecom operators. Such revolutionary technological changes, together with the integration of various industries entails a series of challenges. The aim of this paper is to define important information, challenges and opportunities for the telecom industry to provide mobility for people and goods. © 2016 Croatian Society MIPRO.},

In IoT based healthcare, diverse distributed devices aggregate, analyse and communicate real time medical information to the cloud, thus making it possible to collect, store and analyse the large amount of data in several new forms and activate context based alarms. This novel information acquisition paradigm allows continuous and ubiquitous medical information access from any connected device over the Internet. As each one of the devices used in IoT are limited in battery power, it is optimal to minimise the power consumption to enhance the life of the healthcare system. This work explains the implementation of an IoT based In-hospital healthcare system using ZigBee mesh protocol. The healthcare system implementation can periodically monitor the physiological parameters of the In-hospital patients. Thus, IoT empowered devices simultaneously enhance the quality of care with regular monitoring and reduce the cost of care and actively engage in data collection and analysis of the same. © 2015 IEEE.},

  Abstract                 = {In this paper, we have considered the problem of infrastructure-based indoor localization, where Bluetooth Low Energy (BLE) technology based network infrastructures for Received Signal Strength Indicator (RSSI) measurement are used. Our approach to localize the mobile node is based on the relative change in the RSSI values obtained from BLE network, provided the knowledge of certain area specific information. The main advantage of this approach is that even the large environmental changes in the working area creates very less effect on the localization results. A new RSSI smoothing algorithm is proposed in such a way that it reduces the effect of sudden environmental changes on RSSI values. We have also formulated an integer optimization problem, where path loss exponent is optimized subject to a given area specific information. Since this problem is Non-deterministic Polynomial-time Hard (NP-Hard), we have presented sub-optimal solution to this problem, which are far better than the state-of-the-art approaches presented in the literature. Our proposed approaches provide an accuracy of average error in distance of 1.162 meter. © 2016 IEEE.},

Lightweight implementations of the required security features are the need of the hour considering the resource constrained nature of the underlying nodes and networks. At the same time, it is essential to ensure that such implementations are robust, reliable and efficient. This paper addresses this need by providing a framework for implementing a lightweight version of the Datagram Transport Layer Security protocol in the Internet of Things. In addition, a real-world application scenario incorporating this lightweight security approach is included for illustration in this position paper. It also sheds light on the ongoing standardization activities in the security domain and relevant future directions to help practitioners keep abreast of all the related developments. © 2014 IEEE.},

Therefore, systems to monitor dust concentrations and atmospheric environments in indoor environments where people reside are necessary. In this respect, in the present study, a system was developed that can monitor comprehensive indoor atmospheric environments by acquiring fine dust concentrations, temperatures, and humidity so that general users can easily identify the results. In addition, as kitchen utensils and electrical machinery and apparatuses are used indoors for long periods of time, the importance of fire-watching has been increasing. Therefore, in the present study, real time fire-watching was enabled by installing fire-watching and monitoring systems in indoor sections where fire may occur. Dust sensors, temperature and humidity sensors were used to determine dust concentrations and indoor air quality, Arduino microcontrollers were used to enable data acquisition and monitoring, and Raspberry Pi microcontrollers and image sensors were combined to implement fire-watching and monitoring systems. © 2016 SERSC.},

The presented approaches make use of the optical document-to-reader channel which is more secure than the radio-frequency communication interface. To demonstrate the potential of our approaches we show how they could overcome a number of existing security and privacy threats of electronic passports. © 2006 Springer-Verlag France, Paris.},

  Abstract                 = {The Internet of Things (IoT) is part of the Future Internet. IoT comprises a huge amount of devices (hereinafter called as constrained devices) able to interact with the environment and to communicate over the Internet. Among other challenges that prevents the growth of IoT, the IoT is challenged for security issues. In this work, we are mainly interested in secure communication concerns for constrained devices. In essence, constrained devices are devices operating under low-power, and with limited computational and network resources. For such characteristics, they do not support standard security protocols and, consequently, they become a potential target for traditional Internet attacks (e.g., Denial of Service and man-in-The-middle). Thus, we introduce an architecture to enable constrained devices to use Datagram Transport Layer Security (DTLS) with mutual authentication to communicate with Internet devices. Briefly, we propose a third part device called Internet of Things Security Support Provider (IoTSSP) and two main mechanisms: (i) the Optional Handshaking Delegation, and (ii) the Transfer of Session. Experimental results show the proposal feasibility and its additional benefits. © 2015 IEEE.},

  Abstract                 = {Among the security issues in the environment of the Internet of things (IOT), the security of information source is a privilege to be protected. To protect data collection and control in IOT, the authenticity of information source must ascertained, therefore identity authentication technology is essential. In this paper, we propose an enhanced bidirectional authentication scheme suitable for Radio Frequency Identification (RFID) communications among devices or between devices and control devices. Specific improvement measures include three aspects: back-up terminals, a condition monitoring device to increase authentication properties, and an alarm mechanism. The enhanced bidirectional authentication protocol presented here has the characteristics of excellent performance in security and privacy protection, which could authenticate data contents, even positions and other data properties, and resist the replay or denial of service attacks. At the same time, it could overcome the defect of data asynchrony between the front and back ends, providing users with excellent forward security. The simulation experiments showed that system reliability was greatly enhanced by adopting the proposed protocol. © 2016, UK Simulation Society. All rights reserved.},

The technology-based exploratory capabilities play a more important role for firms adopting get-ahead strategy in technology, and technology-based exploitative capabilities play a more important role for firms adopting catch-up strategy in technology.

However, the performance of IEEE 802.15.4 devices under WiFi interference are evaluated based on limit parameters i.e. Packet Reception Rate, which does not exhibit the dynamic interactions in the wireless channel. In this paper, we conduct a series of experiments to demonstrate the dynamic interactions between the IEEE 802.15.4 and IEEE 802.11 bgn standards on relevant devices. The performance of four existing Link Quality Estimators (LQEs) of IEEE 802.15.4 nodes under the IEEE 802.11 bgn interference is analyzed. We show that IEEE 802.15.4 transmission failures are largely due to channel access failures rather than corrupted data packets. Based on the analysis, we propose a new LQE - Packet Reception Rate with Clear Channel Assessment - by merging the Clear Channel Assessment count with the Packet Reception Rate. In comparison to existing LQEs, results show that the new estimator distinguishes persistent IEEE 802.11 bgn traffic more robustly. © 2015 IEEE.},

However, the current information system is difficult to meet the conversion between low-level information and operational level so that the enterprise is unable to respond to changes in the supply chain system timely. On the basis of complex event processing as the core for supply chain applications, the paper put forward the SOA information services architecture which is based on Internet of Things (IOT). It realizes the transmission of information of the web service application services through defining complex event detection mode, meets the enterprise's requirements for the available information from business level, which also provides support for rapid decision-making of the supply chain.},

Concerted research effort over the past five years has developed the technology and reduced cost to a point where deployment is now possible.

  Abstract                 = {Power supply availability is a limiting factor in wearable devices whose form factor constrains battery size. Wearable harvesters that collect energy from the environment are a promising technology to achieve the long-life goal for truly wearable devices. However, most of the mature energy harvesting approaches usually imply an outdoor setting, using solar panels, wind turbines or high-frequency vibration as energy sources. In particular, most kinetic harvesters are not effective with human motion frequencies and mobility patterns. In this paper, we evaluate and integrate a highly-efficient kinetic harvester circuit to power autonomous wearable devices, exploiting the energy gathered from human motion. For this purpose, a Kinetron Micro Generator System 26.4 (MSG) has been characterized, conversion circuits have been designed and evaluated using off-the-shelf components. The implemented kinetic harvesting system successfully manages to harvest energy from human movements and stores it in small supercapacitors or batteries. Experimental results show that it is possible to harvest up to 280 μJ from a single small human movement and up to 1.1J per-day using a passive rectifier. This results in up to 180 μJ for single burst of energy and 0.7J per-day stored energy in a battery following a direct current conversion. These are extremely promising results for small wearable kinetic harvesting, and demonstrate that this new generation of kinetic energy harvesters can be instrumental in the design of many self-sustainable wearable devices. © 2016 IEEE.},

  Abstract                 = {Currently, one of the hottest topics in the Internet of Things (IoT) research domain regards the issue to overcome the heterogeneity of proprietary technologies and systems so as to enable the integration of applications and devices developed for different environments in a single interoperable framework. Towards this objective, virtualization is widely used to foster integration and creation of new services and applications. Similar benefits are expected by its application in the smart grid arena. The use of a virtualization middleware is expected to enrich the capabilities and opportunities related to the use of smart grid devices. In this paper, we propose key features for an interoperable, re-usable, elastic and secure smart grid architecture which is cloud-based and relies on REST APIs. To highlight the benefits, a practical case study is presented, where outlined functionalities are implemented in a cloud-based IoT platform. The advantages brought by the proposed middleware in terms of interoperability, re-usability, privacy and elasticity of the underlying infrastructure are discussed. © 2016 IEEE.},

  Abstract                 = {Population aging and increasing pressure on health systems are two issues that demand solutions. Involving and empowering citizens as active managers of their health represents a desirable shift from the current culture mainly focused on treatment of disease, to one also focused on continuous health management and well-being. Current developments in technological areas such as the Internet of Things (IoT), lead to new technological solutions that can aid this shift in the healthcare sector. This study presents the design, development, implementation and evaluation of a platform called Common Recognition and Identification Platform (CRIP), a part of the CareStore project, which aims at supporting caregivers and citizens to manage health routines in a seamless way. Specifically, the CRIP offers sensor-based support for seamless identification of users and health devices. A set of initial requirements was defined with a focus on usability limitations and current sensor technologies. The CRIP was designed and implemented using several technologies that enable seamless integration and interaction of sensors and people, namely Near Field Communication and fingerprint biometrics for identification and authentication, Bluetooth for communication with health devices and web services for wider integration with other platforms. Two CRIP prototypes were implemented and evaluated in laboratory during a period of eight months. The evaluations consisted of identifying users and devices, as well as seamlessly configure and acquire vital data from the last. Also, the entire Carestore platform was deployed in a nursing home where its usability was evaluated with caregivers. The evaluations helped assess that seamless identification of users and seamless configuration and communication with health devices is feasible and can help enable the IoT on healthcare applications. Therefore, the CRIP and similar platforms could be transformed into a valuable enabling technology for secure and reliable IoT deployments on the healthcare sector. © 2016 by the authors; licensee MDPI, Basel, Switzerland.},

In this paper, we present an 6LoWPAN based architecture of sensor/actuator nodes, that employ Simple Service Location Protocol(SSLP), and respond to all service related queries from the user devices. The system implements Constrained Application Protocol(CoAP) a RESTful Architecture to leverage service access similar to HTTP transactions. The proposed architecture also integrates various protocols, defined specific to the constrained LoWPANs like, Neighbor Discovery(ND) Protocol, and Routing Protocol for Low power lossy networks(RPL) for interactions between traditional IP networks and the 6LoWPAN network. © 2014 IEEE.},

To successfully facilitate this paradigm, multiple needs can be identified along three axes: (i) online configuring an ensemble of systems, (ii) achieving a concerted function of collaborating systems, and (iii) providing the enabling infrastructure. This work focuses on the collaborative function dimension and presents a set of concrete examples of CPS challenges. The examples are illustrated based on a pick and place machine that solves a distributed version of the Towers of Hanoi puzzle. The system includes a physical environment, a wireless network, concurrent computing resources, and computational functionality such as, service arbitration, various forms of control, and processing of streaming video. The pick and place machine is of medium-size complexity. It is representative of issues occurring in industrial systems that are coming online. The entire study is provided at a computational model level, with the intent to contribute to the model-based research agenda in terms of design methods and implementation technologies necessary to make the next generation systems a reality. © 2015, Springer-Verlag Berlin Heidelberg.},

  Abstract                 = {Purpose-The purpose of this paper is to review and explore the evolution, advances and future trends of cloud manufacturing, placing the focus on the quality of services. Moreover, moving toward the new trend of cyber-physical systems (CPS), a cloud-based cyber-physical system (CBCPS) is proposed combining the key enabling techniques of this decade, namely Internet of Things (IoT), cloud computing, Big Data analytics and CPS. Design/methodology/approach-First, an extensive review is made on cloud computing and its applications in manufacturing sectors, namely product development, manufacturing processes and manufacturing systems management. Second, a conceptual CBCPS which combines key enabling techniques including cloud computing, CPS and IoT is proposed. Finally, a review on the quality of the services (QoS) presented in the second step, along with the main security issues of cloud manufacturing, is conducted. Findings-The findings of this review indicate that the combination of the key enabling techniques presented in the CBCPS will lead to a new manufacturing paradigm capable of facing the new challenges and trends. The opportunities, as well as the challenges and barriers of the proposed framework are presented, concluding that the transition into this whole new era of networked computing and manufacturing has a valuable impact, but also generates several security and quality issues. Originality/value-The paper is the first to specifically study the QoS as a factor in the proposed manufacturing paradigm. © 2016 Emerald Group Publishing Limited.},

Sufficient details are provided on how to configure and operate the SDR equipment and the associated software. Measurement data is then collected from both WiFi and GSM signals, and least squares localization techniques are used for finding the target device's location. The obtained indoor localization accuracies are shown to be reasonable, considering that off-the-shelf equipment has been used with passive sniffing of a target user's signal strength. © 2017 IEEE.},

  Abstract                 = {ZigBee is often chosen as a technology to connect things because of characteristics, such as network resilience, interoperability, and low power consumption. In addition, Zigbee Pro, with its Green Power feature, allows low-power networking capable of supporting more than 64 000 devices on a single network, making it an excellent choice to connect things. However, in recent years, we have witnessed the proliferation of smart devices using either 802.11 or ZigBee technologies, which operate in the same frequency band. Proposing and developing techniques that may improve the fair operation and performance of these technologies in coexistence scenarios have been a major concern in industry and academia. In this paper, we propose the use of traffic prioritization for ZigBee nodes in order to improve their performance when coexisting with IEEE 802.11 nodes. We develop an analytical model based on Markov chains, which captures the behavior of channel access mechanisms for both 802.11 nodes and different ZigBee priority class nodes. Based on extensive simulations, we validate the accuracy of the proposed model, and demonstrate how traffic prioritization of ZigBee nodes effectively improves their performance when coexisting with 802.11 nodes. We also demonstrate that this improvement comes at the cost of negligible degradation in the performance of the 802.11 nodes. © 2016 IEEE.},

  Abstract                 = {Security and privacy issues in RFID technology gain tremendous popularity recently. However, existing work on RFID authentication problems always make assumptions such as (1) hash function can be fully employed in designing RFID protocols; (2) channels between readers and server are always secure. The first assumption is not suitable for EPC Class-1 Gen-2 tags, which has been challenged in many research work, while the second one cannot be directly adopted in mobile RFID applications where wireless channels between readers and server are always insecure. To solve these problems, in this paper, we propose a novel ultralightweight and privacy-preserving authentication protocol for mobile RFID systems. We only use bitwise XOR, and several special constructed pseudo-random number generators to achieve our aims in the insecure mobile RFID environment. We use GNY logic to prove the security correctness of our proposed protocol. The security and privacy analysis show that our protocol can provide several privacy properties and avoid suffering from a number of attacks, including tag anonymity, tag location privacy, reader privacy, forward secrecy, and mutual authentication, replay attack, desynchronization attack etc. We implement our protocol and compare several parameters with existing work, the evaluation results indicate us that our protocol significantly improves the system performance. © 2014 Springer Science+Business Media New York.},

The methodology, developed through the European collaboration SHIELD, is applied for the smart grid network as deployed in the South of Norway. Three Smart Grid use cases are analysed in detail, being billing, home control and alarm. The SHIELD methodology uses a Multi-Metrics approach to evaluate the system SPD level during running processes and compares it with use case goals for S, P, and D. The simplicity, applicability, and scalability of the suggested Multi-Metrics approach is demonstrated in this paper. It shows that a single configuration is not sufficient to satisfy the given goals for all use cases. © 2015 River Publishers.},

  Abstract                 = {Food consumption in Malaysia has been frequently debated, neither for the question of its nutrition nor for the freshness of the food, but for one ultimate concern: HALAL. Recently, Malaysia's latest claim to be one of the halal hubs in the world was put to test due to the unbelievable result of recent raid carried out by the Malaysia's authority. The finding was appalling and unethical as some so-called halal foods and some of the so-called halal premises do not comply with the regulation set by the Malaysia's authority, thus making the food prepared by this socalled halal premises no longer halal and may not be consume by the Muslims. Stringent inspections were carried out where massive tracking were involved to link the food product with its processor. The commotion pertaining to this issue was immense. Muslim consumers in Malaysia began to question the effectiveness of food tracking in Malaysia's market. The purpose of this paper is to discuss and to identify appropriate solution on halal tag tracking with real time update mechanism for the usage of end users and for the usage within the halal hub participants. The RFID tag tracking technology is proposed in this paper as a tracking tool.},

  Abstract                 = {Owing to an increase in mobile devices and the advent of the Internet of Things (IoT), mobile traffic has increased exponentially. Consequently, a wide range of research on handover has been conducted to provide mobile device users with stable network quality. Most research on handover uses a network-dependent method that establishes a new protocol or a method that can refine handover time; however, these methods are difficult to apply because they necessitate network-level changes or they are unable to reduce the fundamental delay that occurs in handover, respectively. This paper suggests a simple and powerful handover scheme based on Multi-Radio Access Technology (Multi-RAT) as well as a method to efficiently use Multi-RAT when handover is not required. This method uses a Multi-RAT terminal equipped with a motion sensor. If a terminal motion exists, the active link and standby link of the mobile node enhance handover performance through data transfer and sensing, respectively. If the node is stationary, its transfer throughput is increased through Carrier Aggregation (CA). In this study, we build a testbed to enable handover based on the aforementioned mechanism and assess the performance of the proposed method through an experiment. © 2016 IEEE.},

  Abstract                 = {The manufacturing industry is currently in the midst of a data-driven revolution, which promises to transform traditional manufacturing facilities in to highly optimised smart manufacturing facilities. These smart facilities are focused on creating manufacturing intelligence from real-time data to support accurate and timely decision-making that can have a positive impact across the entire organisation. To realise these efficiencies emerging technologies such as Internet of Things (IoT) and Cyber Physical Systems (CPS) will be embedded in physical processes to measure and monitor real-time data from across the factory, which will ultimately give rise to unprecedented levels of data production. Therefore, manufacturing facilities must be able to manage the demands of exponential increase in data production, as well as possessing the analytical techniques needed to extract meaning from these large datasets. More specifically, organisations must be able to work with big data technologies to meet the demands of smart manufacturing. However, as big data is a relatively new phenomenon and potential applications to manufacturing activities are wide-reaching and diverse, there has been an obvious lack of secondary research undertaken in the area. Without secondary research, it is difficult for researchers to identify gaps in the field, as well as aligning their work with other researchers to develop strong research themes. In this study, we use the formal research methodology of systematic mapping to provide a breadth-first review of big data technologies in manufacturing. © 2015, O’Donovan et al.},

This paper proposes an Iterative Weighted KNN (IW-KNN) indoor localization method based on RSSI (Receive Signal Strength indicator) of the BLE (Bluetooth Low Energy), which has a low power consumption, a long life expectancy. An enormous amount of RSSI are collected to build a fingerprints database. IW-KNN has three principal improvement approaches. Firstly, Euclidean distance, Cosine similarity are combined to measure the similarity of two RSSI vectors, which can take both length, direction of vector into consideration. Secondly, unlike traditional KNN (K Nearest Neighbors) which estimates a position by a majority vote of its neighbors, a weighting factor is applied to neighbors for localization. Thirdly, IW-KNN selects different iBeacons to obtain RSSI at each iteration, calculates the mean position as the final result after several iterations. Compared with several indoor localization methods, namely, traditional KNN, Similarity improved KNN, Weighted KNN, IW-KNN can estimate positions effectively, decrease the mean error by 1.5 to 2.7 meters in our experimental environment. © 2016 IEEE.},

Accordingly, the problem of Internet of Things security has become more and more challenging day-by-day. As IoT systems are very diverse in their requirements and implementations, here specifically focus on smart home systems. A smart home consists of diverse smart devices interconnected through Internet and therefore these low capacity devices and wireless networks, needs an adequate level of security when all working together. This paper presents a multi-level authentication system for smart home network and this authentication scheme is to make the network more secure. The proposed scheme provides various security properties which include data confidentiality and integrity, mutual authentication, forward security and privacy preservation and also provides prevention of various popular IoT attacks. In addition, when compared with other alternative schemes from the literature the proposed scheme acquires both computation and communication efficiency. © 2016 IEEE.},

  Abstract                 = {6LoWPAN (IPv6 over Low-Power Wireless Personal Area Networks) standard allows heavily constrained devices to connect to IPv6 networks. 6LoWPAN is novel IPv6 header compression protocol, it may go easily under attack. Internet of Things consist of devices which are limited in resource like battery powered, memory and processing capability etc. for this a new network layer routing protocol is designed called RPL (Routing Protocol for low power Lossy network). RPL is light weight protocol and doesn't have the functionality like of traditional routing protocols. This rank based routing protocol may goes under attack. Providing security in Internet of Things is challenging as the devices are connected to the unsecured Internet, limited resources, the communication links are lossy and set of novel technologies used such as RPL, 6LoWPAN etc. This paper focus on possible attacks on RPL and 6LoWPAN network, counter measure against them and consequences on network parameters. Along with comparative analysis of methods to mitigate these attacks are done and finally the research opportunities in network layer security are discussed. © 2015 IEEE.},

  Abstract                 = {The occurrence of short but recurrent opportunistic contacts between static infrastructure and mobile devices largely characterizes recent Internet of Things (IoT) applications for Smart Cities and Smart Buildings scenarios. In order to efficiently exploit such existing communication opportunities to access services, share and collect data, IoT applications cannot rely on standard discovery mechanisms that periodically probe the environment to discover resources. Discovery protocols resilient to different contact opportunities and able to optimize energy consumption when device contacts are not present are therefore required in order to avoid waste of energy especially in battery operated user devices. Additionally, such new discovery protocols need to optimize the time available for communication operations, while being able to adjust to application requirements, and balance energy consumption with respect to latency for contacts discovery. To this aim, we introduce CARD, a Context Aware Resource Discovery framework that leveraging Q-Learning techniques extends the functionalities of asynchronous neighbor discovery protocols, while being capable to reduce energy wastage and discovery latency. Simulation results show that CARD performs better than existing approaches and is resilient to a variety of real scenarios characterizing Smart Cities and Smart Building deployments. © 2014 IEEE.},

  Abstract                 = {Objective: The main objective is to develop a smart device, which is integrated in order to help the aged people during the time of medical emergency situations using Internet of Things (IoT). Methods: The technical methodology implemented is to develop a smart device which works on the basic support of the android application. The device serving people in danger is built using the smart phone applications, Bluetooth transmitter and receiver and microcontroller (Kiel micro vision). Kiel micro vision is an integrated development environment used to create software to be run on embedded system (like a microcontroller). Effective Quality of Service (QoS) is achieved using the concept of IoT. Findings: The concept of IoT is implemented in order to develop an environment which provides a unique way to communicate and transfer data from one end to the other end. The Internet of Things is a new way implementation in the field of medical background, which acts as a media for information retrieval from physical world to digital world, which is enhanced by the support of android platform. Hence the embedded system together constitutes two devices: Stationary device and a Movable device. The Stationary device is inbuilt with an ATMEL Microcontroller, RF Receiver, Bluetooth module, Step-down transformer, an LCD display, Voltage regulator, resistors and Capacitors. The movable device is inbuilt with two buttons along with a RF Transmitter. Application: The smart device for alerting a person's critical health condition is of good use as it is less expensive and easy to handle, since the people in need are helped in the right time. Moreover this system can also alert our neighborhood even in situations like robbery. The Stationary device which the person is handling can be made as a device attached to human body, say a watch. The size of the device is made smaller, even though the cost becomes higher. Call features also added instead of message feature because everyone looks on text message.},

  Abstract                 = {Information security has become an important issue in data communications. One method to ensure the security of data is to use cryptographic method. Cryptography is a method to encode the information to keep the information from being hacked by the other party. The implementation of cryptography is used a significant amount of computer resources. Various range application of blowfish algorithm can be implemented for data encryption sent from an Internet of Things physical network which have IP-based data. In this research, blowfish algorithm is implemented on FPGA using VHDL programming language, and monitored the number of FPGA resource that is used.

  Abstract                 = {Objective: This paper presents the Field Programmable Gate Array (FPGA) implementations of the different block cipher mode architectures of the ISO standardized light weight block cipher PRESENT, designed for resource constrained devices. Methods/Statistical Analysis: The performance evaluations compare the implementations of the different block cipher modes, namely Electronic Code Book (ECB) mode, Cipher Block Chaining (CBC) mode, Cipher Feedback Mode (CFB), Output Feed Back Mode (OFB) and CounTeR (CTR) mode for the PRESENT cipher. The throughput of encryption of three successive 64 bit blocks of data ranges from 565.312Mbps to 574.784Mbps for the modes other than the cipher feedback mode in the Spartan-3 FPGA. The throughput for providing confidentiality through encryption in the cipher feedback mode arrives as 68.912 Mbps, 155.392Mbps and300.8 Mbps for a 64 bit block of data for the input streams of size 8 bits, 16 bits and 32 bits respectively. Findings: The throughput of the block cipher mode hardware architectures of the light weight cipher PRESENT demonstrates the high speed performance of the cipher in encryption/decryption of data as blocks and streams. Application/Improvement: The significance of the proposed work is to know the hardware performance of the different modes of operation for the light weight block cipher PRESENT. The performance estimation of the block cipher modes operations of the PRESENT cipher definition in hardware have been carried out for the first time.},

The research thinking in IoT is bringing a change in the life style of the society. As many of the developing countries are involved in construction of smart cities, there arises a need to educate current generation engineers to get knowledge of IoT. To cater this, an open elective IoT has been introduced at eighth semester by Computer Science & Engineering Under Graduate (UG) program for circuit branch students. This paper discusses the challenges and experiences of introducing IoT as an open elective course. The first challenge in offering this course is identifying the content of the course, at what level the course needs to be introduced, since both hardware and software components are involved in IoT. Second challenge is involving students in learning process as it is not only theory based and different knowledge level students are part of this course. To address these challenges we followed activity based approach for teaching and learning this course. Various real-world problems are identified, and assigned to different teams consisting of four students. Outcome based evaluation is followed to assess the group activity. The author's observations indicate that the activity based learning addresses graduate attributes of UG program, such as Design/Development of solutions, Modern tool usage, Engineer and society and Life-long learning. The average attainment of the mentioned graduate attributes is 79.18% for the course in continuous internal assessment. © 2016 IEEE.},

  Abstract                 = {Real-world deployments of Internet of Things (IoTs) applications require secure communication. The IPSec (Internet Protocol Security) is an important and widely used security protocol (in the IP layer) to provide end to end secure communication. Implementation of the IPSec is a computing intensive work, which significantly limits the performance of the high speed networks. To overcome this issue, hardware implementation of IPSec is a best solution. IPSec includes two main protocols namely; Authentication Header (AH) and Encapsulating Security Payload (ESP) with two modes of operations, transport mode and tunnel mode. In this work we presented an FPGA implementation of IPSec AH protocol. This implementation supports both, tunnel and transport mode of operation. Cryptographic hash function called Secure Hash Algorithm - 3 (SHA-3) is used to calculate hash value for AH protocol. The proposed IPSec AH core can be used to provide data authentication security service to IoT applications. © 2015 IEEE.},

  Abstract                 = {The Internet of Things (IoT) enables a wide range of application scenarios with potentially critical actuating and sensing tasks, e.g., in the e-health domain. For communication at the application layer, resource-constrained devices are expected to employ the constrained application protocol (CoAP) that is currently being standardized at the Internet Engineering Task Force. To protect the transmission of sensitive information, secure CoAP mandates the use of datagram transport layer security (DTLS) as the underlying security protocol for authenticated and confidential communication. DTLS, however, was originally designed for comparably powerful devices that are interconnected via reliable, high-bandwidth links. In this paper, we present Lithe-an integration of DTLS and CoAP for the IoT. With Lithe, we additionally propose a novel DTLS header compression scheme that aims to significantly reduce the energy consumption by leveraging the 6LoWPAN standard. Most importantly, our proposed DTLS header compression scheme does not compromise the end-to-end security properties provided by DTLS. Simultaneously, it considerably reduces the number of transmitted bytes while maintaining DTLS standard compliance. We evaluate our approach based on a DTLS implementation for the Contiki operating system. Our evaluation results show significant gains in terms of packet size, energy consumption, processing time, and network-wide response times when compressed DTLS is enabled. © 2001-2012 IEEE.},

In this paper we will analyse not only the applicability of existing mechanisms such as public key cryptography and pre-shared keys for sensor nodes in the IoT context, but also the applicability of those link-layer oriented key management systems (KMS) whose original purpose is to provide shared keys for sensor nodes belonging to the same WSN.},

  Abstract                 = {Augmented Reality (AR) is one of the Ubiquitous Computing Technologies that can be used for realizing Internet of Things (IoT) application. The fact is to create an artificial world that provides sense of a real world where a real life is enhanced by virtual elements in real times. This project deals with the development and implementation of Augmented Reality software for linguistic conversion on smart phones. This exploits smart phone's processing capabilities for sensing external objects using camera, to augment the real world objects with virtual data for character recognition and conversion from English Text to Tamil Language. The Tamil Text is overlaid on the captured English Text by providing the meaning to the word captured in modern language. Image processing and image analysis tend to focus on 2D images, how to transform one image to another, e.g., by pixel-wise operations such as contrast enhancement, local operations such as edge extraction or noise removal, or geometrical transformations such as rotating the image. This characterization implies that image processing/analysis neither require assumptions nor produce interpretations about the image content. The scope for this paper is to make an application for a phone using mobile OS, with the subject of augmented reality. The application should be a prototype using a library. This will be done by implementing several modules that serves as a basis to augment the reality, by using the phone's camera. © 2016 IEEE.},

  Abstract                 = {To fulfill the vision of the Future Internet a ubiquitous deployment of IPv6 is a necessity. The work presented in this paper combines networking technologies and mobile software application development to support interworking of mobile devices and smart objects. We report on the implementation of an Android IPv6 smartphone that interworks with Web-enabled wireless sensors in the Internet of Things. This includes a possible network setup for IPv4/IPv6 interworking by using a public tunnel broker service. The demonstrated solution is universal, since the Android device can be connected to any IP network, even where a Network Address Translation (NAT) device is deployed. © 2012 IEEE.},

  Abstract                 = {IPv6 over resource-constrained devices (6Lo) emerged as a de-facto standard for the Internet of Things (IoT) applications especially in home and building automation systems. We provide results of an investigation of the applicability of 6LoWPAN with RPL mesh networks for home and building automation use cases. The proper selection of Trickle parameters and neighbor reachable time-outs is important in the RPL protocol suite to respond efficiently to any path failure. These parameters were analyzed in the context of energy consumption w.r.t the number of control packets. The measurements were performed in an Automated Physical Testbeds (APTB). The results match the recommendation by RFC 7733 for selecting various parameters of RPL protocol suite. This paper shows the relationship between various RPL parameters and control traffic overhead during network rebuild. Comparative measurement results with Bluetooth Low Energy (BLE) in this work showed that 6Lo with RPL outperformed BLE in this use case with less control traffic overheads. © 2016 IEEE.},

Up to now, most of IoT devices equip still personal area level wireless radio interfaces due to cost of radio modules, energy consumption, and subscription requirement of wireless cellular networks such as 3G, WiMAX and LTE. In order to collect data from such devices possibly moving in the Internet, a gateway or relay node that can transfers the data using wide area communication techniques is necessary. A smartphone which provide a tethering function can play a role of the gateway for personal IoT environment and it does not require additional subscription for personal IoT devices and provides location independent connectivity.

Mobility support in 6LoWPANs for large-scale IP-based sensor technology in future IoT is still in its infancy. The hospital wireless network is one important 6LoWPAN application of the IoT, it keeps continuous monitoring of vital signs of moveing patients. Proper mobility management is needed to maintain connectivity between patient nodes and the hospital network. In this paper, first we survey IPv6 mobility protocols and propose a solution for a hospital architecture based on 6LoWPAN technology. Moreover, we discuss an important metric like signaling overload to optimize the power consumption and how it can be optimized through the mobility management. This metric is more effective on the mobile router as a coordinator in network mobility since a mobile router normally constitutes a bottleneck in such a system. Finally, we present our initial results on a reduction of the mobility signaling cost and the tunneling traffic on the mobile PAN.},

  Abstract                 = {Specifically, ZigBee networks share the 2.4 GHz ISM band with WiFi but have much lower transmission power. Therefore, the ZigBee networks inevitably suffer the interference from WiFi networks. In this paper, we focus on utilising the temporal and spatial feature of WiFi interference to adjust Zigbee channel over the whole networks. We experimentally examine the spatiotemporal variation of interference and then present a novel interference assessing method which jointly considers the intensity and density of WiFi interference in order to better characterise the relation between interference and link quality. Further considering the interference locality, we propose MuZi (Multi-channel ZigBee) as an interference avoiding approach for ZigBee networks. It aims to determine a better working channel for each node while taking network connectivity into consideration. Our experiments show that, under the existence of WiFi interference, MuZi can achieve 3.3 times throughput than the traditional single-channel method. Copyright © 2015 Inderscience Enterprises Ltd.},

We introduce WSN-Maintain, a Cooja-based tool for maintaining coverage requirements in an in-building WSN. To analyse the coverage of a building, WSN-Maintain takes as input the oorplan of the building, the coverage requirement of each region and the locations of sensor nodes. We take account of the heterogeneity of device specifications in terms of communication capability and sensing coverage. WSN-Maintain is run in parallel with the collect-view tool of Contiki, which was integrated into the Cooja simulator. We show that WSN-Maintain is able to automatically turn on redundant nodes to maintain the coverage requirement when active nodes fail and report failures that require physical maintenance. This tool allows us to evaluate diferent approaches to maintain coverage, including deferring physical maintenance to reduce operational costs.},

  Abstract                 = {Aim: Now a day’s, due to the change in the human food habits, environmental changes, and the industrial consequences the cause of the chronic disease was increasing rapidly. People want to check and monitor their health data regularly. It is a big annoyance and sometimes not possible to check their health condition by spending their time in hospitals. Similarly, the doctors also need to take care of their In-Patients (IP) and Out-Patients (OP) data. In order to reduce these, many healthcare smart devices were found and used by the people. The integration of these smart devices leads to Internet of Things (IoT). Already some secure IoT- based solutions were suggested by the researchers where the smart devices hold by the patients will deliver the patient health condition to the remote doctor securely by using the Internet. This study analyzes that system in terms of integration and security analysis. Result: The performance parameters like rate of malicious node detection and number of successful packets transfer were analyzed. Here IoT application is used to fields and it is very success full. Finally, the security loopholes of the existing system and proposed solution for that security threat were presented. © 2016, Institute of Integrative Omics and Applied Biotechnology.

Here, we propose an ECG remote monitoring system that is dedicated to non-technical users in need of long-term health monitoring in residential environments and is integrated in a broader Internet-of-Things (IoT) infrastructure. Our prototype consists of a complete vertical solution with a series of advantages with respect to the state of the art, considering both the prototypes with integrated front end and prototypes realized with off-the-shelf components: 1) ECG prototype sensors with record-low energy per effective number of quantized levels; 2) an architecture providing low marginal cost per added sensor/user; and 3) the possibility of seamless integration with other smart home systems through a single IoT infrastructure. © 2016 IEEE.},

SCC are envisioned to address synergistically the needs of remembering the past (preservation and revitalization), the needs of living in the present (livability), and the needs of planning for the future (attainability). Therefore, the vision of SCC is to improve livability, preservation, revitalization, and attainability of a community. The goal of building SCC for a community is to live in the present, plan for the future, and remember the past. We argue that Internet of Things (IoT) has the potential to provide a ubiquitous network of connected devices and smart sensors for SCC, and big data analytics has the potential to enable the move from IoT to real-time control desired for SCC. We highlight mobile crowdsensing and cyber-physical cloud computing as two most important IoT technologies in promoting SCC.

There is also an increase in the number of accidents and various other traffic related issues. Intelligent Transportation System (ITS) provides the solution to most of these problems by integrating existing technologies with the underlying infrastructure. With the advent of mobile technology and the ubiquitous cellular network, real time vehicle tracking for efficient transport management has become viable. The futile long wait for a bus to arrive can be avoided by Intelligent Public Transportation System. The omnipresence of Smart Phones and their ever increasing power at a very economical price makes them one of the most attractive options for developing IOT applications. Here, an approach based on the combination of technologies like GPS and Android is discussed which can assuage passengers who commute by the means of public transport. The user is furnished with explicit information about the current location of nearest buses approaching the bus-stop on a mobile application. Using readily available Android API's, technologies like 3G network and SMS based services in the existing mobile phones can reduce the cost and size of hardware required, as well as lead to a better output. © 2016 IEEE.},

Data collected from scattered things in wide area environment can result in big data and therefore the need for big data mining and analysis. In this paper, we mine big data originated from things. Thanks to virtually unlimited of cloud computing resources, we can process mine data and extract knowledge and wisdom from collected data. In this paper, we propose a framework for addressing big data in cloud IoT scenario. As a case study, we investigate Intelligent Transportation System (ITS).

  Abstract                 = {In our exciting world of pervasive computing and always-available mobile internet, meeting the educational needs of students has seen a growing trend toward collaborative electronic and mobile learning systems that build on the vision of Web 2.0. However, other trends relevant to modern students must not be ignored, including data freedom, brokerage and interconnectivity. Such factors are associated with the Internet of Things and the vision for Web 3.0, and so include the needs for greater consideration of data context and educational personalization so important to the future of campus-based, distance and vocational study. Therefore, future education can be expected to require a deeper technological connection between students and learning environments, in a manner requiring significant use of sensors, mobile devices, cloud computing and rich-media visualization. This paper considers the challenges associated with adopting such a futuristic concept as a means of enriching learning materials and environments within a university context. It will be concluded that much of the technology required to embrace the vision of Web 3.0 in education already exists, but that further research in key areas is required for the concept to achieve its full potential. © 2012 Crown Copyright.},

  Abstract                 = {Technology has revolutionized medical practices by enabling more convenient and non-intrusive monitoring of patient's health, leading to next generation ubiquitous healthcare (u-healthcare). The exploitation of the Internet protocol version 6 addressing space along with the miniaturization of electronic devices has fostered providing interoperability and connectivity of wearable sensor devices in wireless body area networks to the Internet of Things. In this paper, we propose to integrate the IPv6 over low power wireless personal area network (6LoWPAN) to the u-healthcare monitoring system architecture. The main objective is to study the feasibility of the 6LoWPAN-enabled platform in real-world scenarios dealing with medical data. The performance evaluation of this platform is carried out initially through simulations using OMNet++ and then supported by an experimental study using sensor motes and a customized micro-computing unit. Performance metrics such as throughput, end-to-end delay, packet error rate, and energy consumption are investigated under acute health conditions, where patient's health information has to be sent continuously and at maximum rate to the care provider. The obtained results show that the proposed 6LoWPAN solution fulfills the main quality of service requirements of u-healthcare applications. Copyright © 2015 John Wiley & Sons, Ltd.

The open-source Project JXTA was initiated a year ago to specify a standard set of protocols for ad hoc, pervasive, peer-to-peer computing as a foundation of the upcoming Web of Things. The following paper presents an up-to-date overview of the JXTA protocols and describes the latest implementation of the JXTA protocols in the "C" programming language. The paper discusses the overall architecture and trade off made to allow the JXTA-C implementation to run on a wide range of devices including supercomputers, servers, PCs, and memory-constrained embedded devices. The JXTA-C implementation delivers a small and efficient implementation of the JXTA protocols stack allowing the JXTA protocols to be embedded at the system level rather than the Java Virtual Machine (JVM) level for optimized performance and capabilities. © 2003 IEEE.},

How to effectively and efficiently apply data mining techniques to analyze the big data plays a crucial role in real-world use cases. In this paper, we propose a novel complex-events analytical system based on episode pattern mining techniques. The proposed system consists of four major components, including data preprocessing, pattern mining, rules management and prediction modules. For the core mining process, we proposed a new algorithm named EM-CES (Episode Mining over Complex Event Sequences) based on the sliding window approach. We also make the proposed system integrable with other application platform for complex event analysis, such that users can easily and quickly make use of it to gain the valuable information from complex data. Finally, excellent experimental results on a real-life dataset for electric power consumption monitoring validate the efficiency and effectiveness of the proposed system.},

"Internet of Things" is a very important step towards an increased networking state of hospital inventory. The use of RFID and IPv6 allows for a low cost, low maintenance solution.

Apart from the obvious advantages of IPv6 such as larger address space (128 bits long), better header format, provision for extension, resource allocation support (Flow Label) and security features and the RFID's no line of sight requirement, long read range, real-time tracking, multiple tag read/write and database portability, the combination of the two and our proposed Virtual MAC Address Generator can provide a unique tracking, low-cost, low power tool in a multi-sensor hospital environment. © 2010 International Federation for Medical and Biological Engineering.},

The Internet of Things (IoT) is a new concept that allows users to connect various sensors and smart devices to collect real-time data from the environment. However, it has been observed that a comprehensive platform is still missing in the e-Health and m-Health architectures to use smartphone sensors to sense and transmit important data related to a patient's health. In this paper, our contribution is twofold. Firstly, we critically evaluate the existing literature, which discusses the effective ways to deploy IoT in the field of medical and smart health care. Secondly, we propose a new semantic model for patients' e-Health. The proposed model named as 'k-Healthcare' makes use of 4 layers; the sensor layer, the network layer, the Internet layer and the services layer. All layers cooperate with each other effectively and efficiently to provide a platform for accessing patients' health data using smart phones. © 2016 IEEE.},

We now have smart devices, BigData, cyber-physical systems, internet-of-things and much more. Because technology is so present in the way we communicate and in our day-to-day activities, the need for strong and efficient security systems is extremely poignant. Cyber-physical systems integrate various components and can interact with their surrounding. Their usage in critical applications requires a robust security architecture. While methods like cryptography or steganography can cover aspects such as protecting data and communications, in order to ensure efficiency and the smart usage of resources we need a different approach. Throughout this paper we will describe a method that uses a hierarchical cryptosystem to protect communications within a cyber-physical system combined with complex event processing to optimize the security architecture. © 2016 IEEE.},

Therefore, the proposed solutions from an IoT networking perspective must take into account the scalability of IoT nodes as well as the operational cost of deploying the networking infrastructure. This will generate a huge volume of data, which poses a tremendous challenge both from the transport, and processing of information point of view. Moreover, security issues appear, due to the fact that untrusted IoT devices are interconnected towards the aggregation networks. In this paper, we propose the usage of a Software- Defined Networking (SDN) framework for introducing security in IoT gateways. An experimental validation of the framework is proposed, resulting in the enforcement of network security at the network edge. © 2016 IEEE.},

The 6LoWPAN-based wireless sensor network, together with the Android edge router, form a mobile sub-network that allows seamless information exchange with the Internet and improves service availability for each end user. The proposed architecture includes a customised bare-metal 6LoWPAN protocol designed for ultra low power wireless sensor nodes for long term vital signs monitoring and integrated with Android devices for mobile internet access.

  Abstract                 = {Energy harvesting from natural environment gives range of benefits for the Internet of things. Scavenging energy from photovoltaic (PV) cells is one of the most practical solutions in terms of power density among existing energy harvesting sources. PV power systems mandate the maximum power point tracking (MPPT) to scavenge the maximum possible solar energy. In general, a switching-mode power converter, an MPPT charger, controls the charging current to the energy storage element (a battery or equivalent), and the energy storage element provides power to the load device. The mismatch between the maximum power point (MPP) current and the load current is managed by the energy storage element. However, such architecture causes significant energy loss (typically over 20%) and a significant weight/volume and a high cost due to the cascaded power converters and the energy storage element. This paper pioneers a converter-less PV power system with the MPPT that directly supplies power to the load without the power converters or the energy storage element. The proposed system uses a nonvolatile microprocessor to enable an extremely fine-grain dynamic power management in a few hundred microseconds. This makes it possible to match the load current with the MPP current. We present detailed modeling, simulation, and optimization of the proposed energy harvesting system including the radio frequency transceiver. Experiments show that the proposed setup achieves an 87.1% of overall system efficiency during a day, 30.6% higher than the conventional MPPT methods in actual measurements, and thus a significantly higher duty cycle under a weak solar irradiance. © 1982-2012 IEEE.},

In this paper we present an environment for the asynchronous simulation of networked multi-core systems, based on SystemC. Combined with the open-source machine emulator and virtualizer QEMU, a virtual network is created. The compute nodes act similar to recent Systems-on-Chip from Xilinx and Altera. By combining an ARM processing system with programmable logic, a high flexibility is provided. We exemplary simulate these systems by extending QEMU, following its device model abstraction qdev. The resulting network benefits from the execution on different host systems. It is highly scalable and designed for the development of complex networked multi-core systems. For the non-distributed execution on one processor we implemented an alternative communication method which takes only 2/3 of the time for networked simulation. © 2014 IEEE.},

  Abstract                 = {There is a broad consensus that the transformative power of the Internet of Things (IoT) will affect all kinds of industries; or, to put it in a more optimistic light, that almost no domain is excluded from the opportunities to leverage the IoT. But, what does this mean for the future of industrial processes? This article introduces the concept of high-resolution management (HRM). IoT enables the collection of high-resolution data for the physical world where, as in the digital world, every aspect of business operations can be measured in real-time. This capability facilitates high-resolution management, such as short optimization cycles in industrial production, logistics and equipment efficiency, comparable to methods like A/B-Testing or Search Engine Optimization, which are state of the art in digital business. We take the following two perspectives on leveraging high-resolution management. First, through greater insights into their industrial processes, companies that apply HRM in their operations are able to achieve higher efficiency, quality and flexibility. The example of vehicle fleet management illustrates this effect. Second, we build upon the St. Gallen Business Model Navigator in order to look in greater detail on how the IoT affects industrial processes. Gassmann et al.1 introduce 55 generic business model patterns, of which our extended research identified 20 that could profit significantly from the IoT2. Analyzing these 20 patterns allowed for the identification of six key components: Remote Usage and Condition Monitoring, Object Self Service, Digital Addon, Digital Lock-in, Product as a Point of Sales and Physical Freemium. These building blocks help companies to supply HRM-supported offerings. Finally, the example of remote monitoring of process parameters shows that these business model components can also be deployed to create offerings that enable others to apply HRM.},

To identify and understand specific changes in information practices brought about by the introduction of smart meters, citizens were interviewed, read a description of planned smart grid/meter implementation, and were asked to reflect on changes in the key actors involved, information attributes, and principles of transmission. Areas where new practices emerge with the introduction of the smart grid were then highlighted as potential problems (privacy violations). Issues identified in this study included concern about unauthorized use and sharing of personal data, data leaks or spoofing via hacking, the blurring distinction between the home and public space, and inferences made from new data types aggregated with other personal data that could be used to unjustly discriminate against individuals or groups.

However, it has also brought a challenge to the privacy, where the source privacy and location privacy are concerned in this paper. We first review some approaches to deal with the source privacy and location privacy, respectively. Then a simple radio frequency identification (RFID) based architecture is proposed in this paper to preserve the privacy of the target object. This architecture can effectively hide the presence of the target object against adversaries. Meanwhile, the location information of the target object can also be preserved by simply transferring the ID information, rather than the location information. Compared with other approaches, it is convenient to implement the proposed architecture to protect the privacy without high computational complexity and additional supplements. Finally, the privacy analysis is presented to demonstrate the performance of the proposed architecture in terms of the source and location privacy preservation. © 2015 IEEE.},

Classical model-based prognostics require an in-depth physical understanding of the system of interest and oftentimes assume certain stochastic or random processes. To overcome the limitations of model-based methods, data-driven methods such as machine learning have been increasingly applied to prognostics and health management (PHM). While machine learning algorithms are able to build accurate predictive models, large volumes of training data are required. Consequently, machine learning techniques are not computationally efficient for data-driven PHM. The objective of this research is to create a novel approach for machinery prognostics using a cloud-based parallel machine learning algorithm. Specifically, one of the most popular machine learning algorithms (i.e., random forest) is applied to predict tool wear in dry milling operations. In addition, a parallel random forest algorithm is developed using the MapReduce framework and then implemented on the Amazon Elastic Compute Cloud. Experimental results have shown that the random forest algorithm can generate very accurate predictions. Moreover, significant speedup can be achieved by implementing the parallel random forest algorithm. © 2016 IEEE.},

However, most methods of controlling the appliances are based on the expatiatory menu, and users usually need to choose the electrical appliances by page turning of the menu items, which is not convenient. Therefore, this paper proposed a distinctive system based on indoor location and attitude estimation. Further more, the indoor location algorithm is achieved with the combination of image pattern recognition and fingerprint matching. The user can choose the appliances that he wants and control them by touching the screen of the mobile device while the mobile device is pointing to the appliance. The prototype of the smart home system is implemented and the availability test is conducted. It proved that the solution will simplify the control operation procedure and improve the user's experience. © 2016 IEEE.},

  Abstract                 = {Internet of Things (IoT) is a new vision of the future technological ubiquity in ubiquitous computing, which becomes the mapping from the real world to the digital one. Radio frequency identification (RFID) technology is a key enabler of the future IoT and it has a great economical potential. However, the RFID system uses of Electronic Product Code (EPC) tags can drastically threaten the security of applications. With the widespread use of RFID technology, its security problems become the hot topic in the academic and industrial fields. Aiming at the RFID network's security problems, we propose a novel P2P based RFID network architecture (P2P-RFID), and analyze the security problems in this kind of network. And a feasible and scalable protocol to guarantee P2P-RFID network security is also presented in this paper. The proposed protocol uses P2P storage technology together with the utilizing of asymmetric encryption algorithm (RSA) based authentication. An analysis proves that the presented protocol is secure. Moreover, the protocol authentication does not require a Certificate Authentication (CA) database, which avoids the single-point bottleneck. © 2011 The Journal of China Universities of Posts and Telecommunications.},

  Abstract                 = {Fog computing brings cloud close to end-users and data sources by enabling computation and storage at the edges of the network. An application can have some of its components running in a “distant” cloud and interacting with the other components running in the fog, closer to end-users and data sources such as wireless sensors. Low latency is the main benefit. Applications spanning cloud and fog, such as Internet of Things (IoT) applications, are still provisioned manually nowadays. This paper proposes an architecture for a Platform as-a-Service (PaaS) to automate applications provisioning in a hybrid cloud/fog environment. Cloud Foundry is used as the basis for its implementation. As a use case, the proposed PaaS was employed to provision a simple component-based IoT application that detects fire and dispatches robots to fight the fire. A prototype is built and measurements are made.},

The proposed approach not only inherits the advantages of the matrix factorization, but also exploits the merits of social relationships and thingthing correlations.

  Abstract                 = {The centralized resource discovery approach in the Constrained Application Protocol (CoAP) is based on the resource directory (RD) model, this directory contains a description for resources held in the servers (sensors and actuators), in which the servers register their resources in the RD while the clients are allowed to perform a lookup operation on these resources, and ask for any resource using single request. In order of making the resource directory fully updated, all nodes are periodically sending update messages (after fixed period of time) to the RD contains the latest status of their information. However, these update messages will result in extra signaling overhead and consume more power from node’s battery, this will drain the batteries and reduce the overall network lifetime, as well as increase the probability of nodes failure. Thus, we have proposed a dynamic tuning technique to adjust the update message interval in CoAP, the proposed algorithm is depending on the battery level of the sending node, in which as battery level decreased the update interval increased, this will reduce the signaling overhead and prolong the node’s battery, which will reflect on the network and prolong its lifetime. Our approach is evaluated using ContikiCooja simulator, where the results of experiments show that the dynamic approach can extend the network lifetime by 25% in comparison with the network lifetime of the standard CoAP. © 2016 Praise Worthy Prize S.r.l. - All rights reserved.},

  Abstract                 = {Radio frequency identification (RFID) is an internet of things technology that provides many benefits to the healthcare industry's supply chain. However, a challenge faced by healthcare industry is the limited adoption and use of RFID by physicians and nurses. This research extended existing work by integrating unified theory of acceptance and use of technology (UTAUT) (i.e. performance expectancy, effort expectancy, facilitating conditions, social influence) and individual differences, namely personality (neuroticism, conscientiousness, openness to experience, agreeableness and extraversion) and demographic characteristics (i.e. age and gender) to predict the adoption of RFID in the healthcare supply chain. Data was collected from 252 physicians and nurses. The research model was tested by employing neural network analysis. During the course of this research, 11 variables were proposed in a bid to predict the adoption of RFID by physicians and nurses. In general, individual differences are able to predict the adoption of RFID better compared to variables derived from UTAUT. This study contributes to the growing interest in understanding the acceptance of RFID in the healthcare industry. © 2014 Elsevier B.V. All rights reserved.},

  Abstract                 = {Smart home is an important applicable field of Internet of Things. In line with the applicable demands and features of smart home, a design of smart home control system by Internet of Things based on ZigBee has been advanced in this paper. In the proposed system, LM3S8962 32-bit processor is used as the main controller to complete the design of embedded WEB server. Meanwhile, a number of things have adopted in the program design, such as RTX operating system in RL-ARM real time database, Common Gateway Interface function and Transmission Control Protocol/Internet Protocol. A variety of tasks of the system function module can be completed by RTX operating system. The information exchange between the client side and the server side can be realized by Common Gateway Interface technology. Ethernet communication can be implemented by Transmission Control Protocol/Internet Protocol. What's more, ZigBee wireless communication module is applied for the local communication, and it can send and receive the transmission information between the main controller and the various home appliances. The experimental results show that remote monitoring appliance can be realized. And the proposed smart home control system is simple and feasible, which can be widely used in smart home remote monitoring. © 2016 IEEE.},

  Abstract                 = {The rapid development of mobile technologies and new learning theories offer opportunities for developing mobile learning systems. Recently, contextual or context-aware mobile learning has become a special focus, as the learning context is a crucial factor for determining learning content and learning objective, or for enhancing learning experiences. What interested us is to apply contextual mobile learning theories to our daily lives and professional situations. We designed a contextual mobile learning system based on IMERA (Mobile Interaction in Augmented Reality Environment) platform, with MOCOCO (Mobility, Contextualization, and Cooperation) features. The system framework is introduced in this paper. The production of learning units using IML-SCORM and LOM standards is the starting point. We used RFID technologies to produce contextualization phases. CTTE (Concur Task Tree environment) tool was used for analyzing and modeling tasks. Mobile devices and peripherals were properly considered and configured according to learning activities and tasks. We suggest that learning methods should be properly considered and adapted based on learning activities, context, devices, etc. In our system, learning activities are very closely related to tasks. Just in time learning, learning and doing, and collaborative learning were appropriately blended into our approach to offer more effective task-centered learning experiences. In actual practice, we propose a learning strategy based on three main steps: before the task, during the task, after the task. The contextual mobile learning system was applied in two case studies: (1) Computer Hardware Maintenance Scenario: we proposed a solution that uses mobile devices (Tablet PC or PDA) and augmented reality accessories (see-through Head Mounted Display) to provide just in time learning opportunities, when users experience difficulties in carrying out computer hardware maintenance tasks. (2) HSHB (Healthy Spirit in Healthy Body) project aimed at assisting people in selecting dishes in university refectory or self-service restaurants according to nutritional composition information and personal preferences offered by mobile devices like PDA or Smartphone. Primary experiments and evaluations were carried out in our laboratory. Usability and acceptability of system and devices together with efficiency and satisfaction of learning activity were the main factors assessed by questionnaire forms. Some useful viewpoints provided by the participants are detailed in this paper.},

In this article, we propose to integrate cloud computing into vehicular networks such that the vehicles can share computation resources, storage resources, and bandwidth resources. The proposed architecture includes a vehicular cloud, a roadside cloud, and a central cloud. Then we study cloud resource allocation and virtual machine migration for effective resource management in this cloud-based vehicular network. A game-theoretical approach is presented to optimally allocate cloud resources. Virtual machine migration due to vehicle mobility is solved based on a resource reservation scheme.}},

Used the authentication number to make the authentication process clear, and used PID to avoid tracking. When in the situation does not need to prevent tracking ID can be used also. The new protocol can detect PID in the database, when conflict occurs, immediately to regenerate it. By comparison to the existing authentication protocol based on hash function, the new protocol can resist attack of anonymity of the tags, position trailing attack, relay attack, DoS/synchronization problems, and used less storage space. © 2016, UK Simulation Society.

In this paper, we focus specifically to an urban IoT system that, while still being quite a broad category, are characterized by their specific application domain. Urban IoTs, in fact, are designed to support the Smart City vision, which aims at exploiting the most advanced communication technologies to support added-value services for the administration of the city and for the citizens. This paper hence provides a comprehensive survey of the enabling technologies, protocols, and architecture for an urban IoT.

The concepts of virtual sensors and virtual devices are identified as central autonomic units to model scalable and context-aware configurable/reconfigurable sensor data and services. The decoupling of the storage and management of sensor data and platform-oriented metadata enables the handling of both discrete and streaming sensor data.

  Abstract                 = {Traceable multi-authority ciphertext-policy attribute-based encryption (CP-ABE) is a practical encryption method that can achieve user traceability and fine-grained access control simultaneously. However, existing traceable multi-authority CP-ABE schemes have two main limitations that prevent them from practical applications. First, these schemes only support small universe: the attributes must be fixed at system setup and the attribute space is restricted to polynomial size. Second, the schemes are either less expressive (the access policy is limited to “AND gates with wildcard”) or inefficient (the system is constructed in composite order bilinear groups). To address these limitations, we present a traceable large universe multi-authority CP-ABE scheme, and further prove that it is statically secure in the random oracle model. Compared with existing traceable multi-authority CP-ABE schemes, the proposed scheme has four advantages. First, the attributes are not fixed at setup and the attribute universe is not bounded to polynomial size. Second, the ciphertext polices can be expressed as any monotone access structures. Third, the proposed scheme is constructed in prime order groups, which makes this scheme more efficient than those in composite order bilinear groups. Finally, the proposed scheme requires neither a central authority nor an identity table for tracing. © 2017, Science China Press and Springer-Verlag GmbH Germany.},

In this paper, we propose a virtual Bloom filter based missing tag detection algorithm (BMD) that can detect missing tags efficiently and fast in multiple reader RFID systems. The key idea is to let tags reply to the reader multiple times in one frame and construct a virtual Bloom filter representing tags in the reader's interrogation region, based on which the missing tags can be detected. Both theoretical analysis and simulation results demonstrate the effectiveness of the proposed BMD algorithm. Compared with the traditional ID-collection based algorithm, BMD reduces per tag energy consumption by more than an order of magnitude and reduces detection time by at most 52%. Compared with IIP, the current best missing tag detection algorithm for single reader RFID systems, BMD reduces per tag energy consumption by more than two orders of magnitude and reduces detection time by at most 80%.},

  Abstract                 = {Wireless sensor networks will suffer severe performance degradation in communication reliability and throughput when interfered by co-located Wifi devices. When multiple sensor networks with different priority are interfered by Wifi devices, it is of great significance to allocate channels according to their priority as well as take into consideration the overall communication reliability and throughput. To address this problem, a channel allocation scheme to mitigate Wifi interference, called EasiCAP (Channel Allocation for wireless sensor networks with Priority), is presented. The scheme employs an external interference model, which is based on interference signal strength and activity ratio, to measure Wifi interference in each channel of sensor networks. In addition, a receiver-centric interference model is used to gauge internal interference amongst different sensor networks. Based on the measurements of external interference and internal interference, each sensor network independently selects its working channel in real time via a localized greedy algorithm in order to assign channels according to priority and also reduce the overall interference of all sensor networks as much as possible. Then, the sensor network performs one of the three operations, i. e., channel keeping, channel swapping, and channel preempting, based on the channel selection decision. Testbed experiments and simulations are conducted to verify the effectiveness of the proposed scheme. The experimental results demonstrate that EasiCAP can provide differentiated communication reliability and throughput corresponding to the network priority. Also, it has higher average communication reliability and throughput than existing schemes. Furthermore, it does not introduce significant overhead.},

The Internet of Things is, thus, the evolution of the Internet to cover the real world, enabling many new services that will improve people's everyday lives, spawn new businesses, and make buildings, cities, and transport smarter. Smart things allow indeed for ubiquitous data collection or tracking, but these useful features are also examples of privacy threats that are already now limiting the success of the Internet of Things vision when not implemented correctly. These threats involve new challenges such as the pervasive privacy-aware management of personal data or methods to control or avoid ubiquitous tracking and profiling. This paper analyzes the privacy issues in the Internet of Things in detail. To this end, we first discuss the evolving features and trends in the Internet of Things with the goal of scrutinizing their privacy implications. Second, we classify and examine privacy threats in this new setting, pointing out the challenges that need to be overcome to ensure that the Internet of Things becomes a reality. © 2013 John Wiley & Sons, Ltd.},

abstract={RFIDs are emerging as a vital component of the Internet of Things. In 2012, billions of RFIDs have been deployed to locate equipment, track drugs, tag retail goods, etc. Current RFID systems, however, can only identify whether a tagged object is within radio range (which could be up to tens of meters), but cannot pinpoint its exact location. Past proposals for addressing this limitation rely on a line-of-sight model and hence perform poorly when faced with multipath effects or non-line-of-sight, which are typical in real-world deployments. This paper introduces the first fine-grained RFID positioning system that is robust to multipath and non-line-of-sight scenarios. Unlike past work, which considers multipath as detrimental, our design exploits multipath to accurately locate RFIDs. The intuition underlying our design is that nearby RFIDs experience a similar multipath environment (e.g., reflectors in the environment) and thus exhibit similar multipath profiles. We capture and extract these multipath profiles by using a synthetic aperture radar (SAR) created via antenna motion. We then adapt dynamic time warping (DTW) techniques to pinpoint a tag's location. We built a prototype of our design using USRP software radios. Results from a deployment of 200 commercial RFIDs in our university library demonstrate that the new design can locate misplaced books with a median accuracy of 11∼cm. © 2013 ACM.},

This work considers service selection as an optimization problem and establishes a Particle Swarm Optimization (PSO)-based web service selection model with quality of service (QoS) constraints. It can be used to address the horizontal adaptation issues from the composite web services. The feasibility and effectiveness of the model are verified by several experiments. © 2013 Elsevier Ltd.

abstract={In this paper, we present an overview of the time-reversal (TR) wireless paradigm for green Internet of Things (IoT). It is shown that the TR technique is a promising technique that focuses signal waves in both time and space domains. The unique asymmetric architecture significantly reduces the cost of the terminal devices, the total number of which is expected to be very large for IoT. The focusing effect of the TR technique can harvest the energy of all the multi-paths at the receiver, which improves the energy efficiency of the wireless transmission and thus the battery life of terminal devices in IoT. Facilitated by the high-resolution spatial focusing, the TR division multiple access scheme leverages the uniqueness of the multi-path profiles in the rich-scattering environment and maps them into location-specific signatures, so that spatial multiplexing can be achieved for multiple users operating on the same spectrum. In addition, the TR system can easily support heterogeneous terminal devices by providing various quality-of-service (QoS) options through adjusting the waveform and rate backoff factor. Finally, the unique location-specific signature in TR system can provide additional physical-layer security and thus can enhance the privacy and security of customers in IoT. All the advantages show that the TR technique is a promising paradigm for IoT. © 2014 IEEE.},

abstract={Developing energy-efficient parallel information processing systems beyond von Neumann architecture is a long-standing goal of modern information technologies. The widely used von Neumann computer architecture separates memory and computing units, which leads to energyhungry data movement when computers work. In order to meet the need of efficient information processing for the data-driven applications such as big data and Internet of Things, an energyefficient processing architecture beyond von Neumann is critical for the information society. Here we show a non-von Neumann architecture built of resistive switching (RS) devices named "iMemComp", where memory and logic are unified with single-type devices. Leveraging nonvolatile nature and structural parallelism of crossbar RS arrays, we have equipped "iMemComp" with capabilities of computing in parallel and learning user-defined logic functions for large-scale information processing tasks. Such architecture eliminates the energy-hungry data movement in von Neumann computers. Compared with contemporary silicon technology, adder circuits based on "iMemComp" can improve the speed by 76.8% and the power dissipation by 60.3%, together with a 700 times aggressive reduction in the circuit area.},

abstract={An interactive human-machine interface (iHMI) enables humans to control hardware and collect feedback information. In particular, wearable iHMI systems have attracted tremendous attention owing to their potential for use in personal mobile electronics and the Internet of Things. Although signifi- cant progress has been made in the development of iHMI systems, those based on rigid electronics have constraints in terms of wearability, comfortability, signal-to-noise ratio (SNR), and aesthetics. Herein the fabrication of a transparent and stretchable iHMI system composed of wearable mechanical sensors and stimulators is reported. The ultrathin and lightweight design of the system allows superior wearability and high SNR. The use of conductive/piezoelectric graphene heterostructures, which consist of poly(L -lactic acid), single-walled carbon nanotubes, and silver nanowires, results in high transparency, excellent performance, and low power consumption as well as mechanical deformability. The control of a robot arm for various motions and the feedback stimulation upon successful executions of commands are demonstrated using the wearable iHMI system. © 2014 WILEY-VCH Verlag GmbH & Co.

abstract={As we are moving towards the Internet of Things (IoT), the number of sensors deployed around the world is growing at a rapid pace. Market research has shown a significant growth of sensor deployments over the past decade and has predicted a significant increment of the growth rate in the future. These sensors continuously generate enormous amounts of data. However, in order to add value to raw sensor data we need to understand it. Collection, modelling, reasoning, and distribution of context in relation to sensor data plays critical role in this challenge. Context-aware computing has proven to be successful in understanding sensor data. In this paper, we survey context awareness from an IoT perspective. We present the necessary background by introducing the IoT paradigm and context-aware fundamentals at the beginning. Then we provide an in-depth analysis of context life cycle. We evaluate a subset of projects (50) which represent the majority of research and commercial solutions proposed in the field of context-aware computing conducted over the last decade (2001-2011) based on our own taxonomy. Finally, based on our evaluation, we highlight the lessons to be learnt from the past and some possible directions for future research. The survey addresses a broad range of techniques, methods, models, functionalities, systems, applications, and middleware solutions related to context awareness and IoT. Our goal is not only to analyse, compare and consolidate past research work but also to appreciate their findings and discuss their applicability towards the IoT. © 2014 IEEE.},

abstract={Wireless Sensor Networks (WSNs) are playing more and more a key role in several application scenarios such as healthcare, agriculture, environment monitoring, and smart metering. Furthermore, WSNs are characterized by high heterogeneity because there are many different proprietary and non-proprietary solutions. This wide range of technologies has delayed new deployments and integration with existing sensor networks. The current trend, however, is to move away from proprietary and closed standards, to embrace IP-based sensor networks using the emerging standard 6LoWPAN/IPv6. This allows native connectivity between WSN and Internet, enabling smart objects to participate to the Internet of Things (IoT). Building an all-IP infrastructure from scratch, however, would be difficult because many different sensors and actuators technologies (both wired and wireless) have already been deployed over the years. After a review of the state of the art, this paper sketches a framework able to harmonize legacy and new installations, allowing migrating to an all-IP environment at a later stage. The Building Automation use case has been chosen to discuss potential benefits of the proposed framework. © 2011 University of Split.},

abstract={The Internet of Things (IoT) is the logical further development of today's Internet. Technological advancements lead to smart objects being capable of identifying, locating, sensing and connecting and thus leading to new forms of communication between people and things and things themselves. Ambient Assisted Living (AAL) encompasses technical systems to support elderly people in their daily routine to allow an independent and safe lifestyle as long as possible. Keep In Touch (KIT) uses smart objects and technologies (Near Field Communication and Radio Frequency Identification) to facilitate telemonitoring processes. Closed Loop Healthcare Services take use of KIT technology and are capable of processing relevant data and establishing communication channels between elderly people and their environment and different groups of care-givers (physicians, relatives, mobile care providers). The combination of KIT technology (smart objects) and Closed Loop Healthcare Services results in an applied IoT infrastructure for AAL scenarios. Already applied IoT and AAL applications in telemonitoring and medication intake compliance projects show that these applications are useful and accepted by the elderly and that the developed infrastructure enables a new form of communication between people and people, people-to-people (P2P) communication. The personal communication between elderly people, their environment and relevant groups of care givers is an important aspect in AAL. Through the combination of KIT and Closed Loop Healthcare, a central AAL paradigm can be realized through the IoT, where the elderly live in their homes with smart objects, thus smart homes, communicating to the outside world in an intelligent and goal-orientated manner.

abstract={Internet of Things devices will by and large be battery-operated, but existing application protocols have typically not been designed with power-efficiency in mind. In low-power wireless systems, power-efficiency is determined by the ability to maintain a low radio duty cycle: keeping the radio off as much as possible. We present an implementation of the IETF Constrained Application Protocol (CoAP) for the Contiki operating system that leverages the ContikiMAC low-power duty cycling mechanism to provide power efficiency. We experimentally evaluate our low-power CoAP, demonstrating that an existing application layer protocol can be made power-efficient through a generic radio duty cycling mechanism. To the best of our knowledge, our CoAP implementation is the first to provide power-efficient operation through radio duty cycling. Our results question the need for specialized low-power mechanisms at the application layer, instead providing low-power operation only at the radio duty cycling layer. © 2011 IEEE.},

I0 uses bits that are bigger than the network which allow the data that make up a packet to be represented in the same way no matter what physical medium conveys them. I0 is aimed at the scaling limits imposed by network complexity rather than raw performance. An I0 device depends on the current routers, gateways and name servers to carry packets between I0 subnetworks.},

abstract={Large-scale, self-organizing wireless sensor and mesh network deployments are being driven by recent technological developments such as The Internet of Things (IoT), Smart Grids and Smart Environment applications. Efficient use of the limited energy resources of wireless sensor network (WSN) nodes is critically important to support these advances, and application of topology control methods will have a profound impact on energy efficiency and hence battery lifetime. In this survey, we focus on the energy efficiency issue and present a comprehensive study of topology control techniques for extending the lifetime of battery powered WSNs. First, we review the significant topology control algorithms to provide insights into how energy efficiency is achieved by design. Further, these algorithms are classified according to the energy conservation approach they adopt, and evaluated by the trade-offs they offer to aid designers in selecting a technique that best suits their applications. Since the concept of «network lifetime» is widely used for assessing the algorithms' performance, we highlight various definitions of the term and discuss their merits and drawbacks. Recently, there has been growing interest in algorithms for non-planar topologies such as deployments in underwater environments or multi-level buildings. For this reason, we also include a detailed discussion of topology control algorithms that work efficiently in three dimensions. Based on the outcomes of our review, we identify a number of open research issues for achieving energy efficiency through topology control. © 1998-2012 IEEE.},

abstract={Relying on the piezopotential created in ZnO under straining, nanogenerators, piezotronics and piezo-phototronics developed based on laterally bonded nanowires on a polymer substrate have been reviewed. The principle of the nanogenerator is a transient flow of electrons in external load as driven by the piezopotential created by dynamic straining. By integrating the contribution made by millions of nanowires, the output voltage has been raised to 1.2 V. Consequently, self-powered nanodevices have been demonstrated. This is an important platform technology for the future sensor network and the internet of things. Alternatively, the piezopotential can act as a gate voltage that can tune/gate the transport process of the charge carriers in the nanowire, which is a gate-electrode free field effect transistor (FET). The device fabricated based on this principle is called the piezotronic device. Piezo-phototronic effect is about the tuning and controlling of electro-optical processes by strain induced piezopotential. The piezotronic, piezophotonic and pieozo-phototronic devices are focused on low frequency applications in areas involving mechanical actions, such as MEMS/NEMS, nanorobotics, sensors, actuators and triggers. © 2010 Elsevier B.V.

abstract={The development of internet of things and the related sensor technology have been a key driving force for the rapid development of industry and information technology. The requirement of wireless, sustainable and independent operation is becoming increasingly important for sensor networks that currently could include thousands even to millions of sensor nodes with different functionalities. For these purposes, developing technologies of self-powered sensors that can utilize the ambient environmental energy to drive the operation themselves is highly desirable and mandatory. The realization of self-powered sensors generally has two approaches: the first approach is to develop environmental energy harvesting devices for driving the traditional sensors; the other is to develop a new category of sensors - self-powered active sensors - that can actively generate electrical signal itself as a response to a stimulation/triggering from the ambient environment. The recent invention and intensive development of triboelectric nanogenerators (TENGs) as a new technology for mechanical energy harvesting can be utilized as self-powered active mechanical sensors, because the parameters (magnitude, frequency, number of periods, etc.) of the generated electrical signal are directly determined by input mechanical behaviors. In this review paper, we first briefly introduce the fundamentals of TENGs, including the four basic working modes. Then, the most updated progress of developing TENGs as self-powered active sensors is reviewed. TENGs with different working modes and rationally designed structures have been developed as self-powered active sensors for a variety of mechanical motions, including pressure change, physical touching, vibrations, acoustic waves, linear displacement, rotation, tracking of moving objects, and acceleration detection. Through combining the open-circuit voltage and the short-circuit current, the detection of both static and dynamic processes has been enabled. The integration of individual sensor elements into arrays or matrixes helps to realize the mapping or parallel detection for multiple points. On the other hand, the relationship between the amplitude of TENG-generated electrical signal and the chemical state of its triboelectric surface enables TENGs to function as self-powered active chemical sensors. Through continuous research on the TENG-based self-powered active sensors in the coming years to further improve the sensitivity and realize the self-powered operation for the entire sensor node systems, they will soon have broad applications in touch screens, electronic skins, healthcare, environmental/infrastructure monitoring, national security, and more. © 2014 Elsevier Ltd.},

abstract={The Internet of Things (IoT) is the next wave of innovation that promises to improve and optimize our daily life based on intelligent sensors and smart objects working together. Through Internet Protocol (IP) connectivity, devices can now be connected to the Internet, thus allowing them to be read, controlled, and managed at any time and at any place. Security is an important aspect for IoT deployments. However, proprietary security solutions do not help in formulating a coherent security vision to enable IoT devices to securely communicate with each other in an interoperable manner. This paper gives an overview of the efforts in the Internet Engineering Task Force (IETF) to standardize security solutions for the IoT ecosystem. We first provide an in-depth review of the communication security solutions for IoT, specifically the standard security protocols to be used in conjunction with the Constrained Application Protocol (CoAP), an application protocol specifically tailored to the needs of adapting to the constraints of IoT devices. Since Datagram Transport Layer Security (DTLS) has been chosen as the channel security underneath CoAP, this paper also discusses the latest standardization efforts to adapt and enhance the DTLS for IoT applications. This includes the use of 1) raw public key in DTLS; 2) extending DTLS record Layer to protect group (multicast) communication; and 3) profiling DTLS for reducing the size and complexity of implementations on embedded devices.

abstract={The shift from manual to wireless metering is changing the information landscape of electricity billing from data poverty to data richness. Simultaneously, but at a slower pace, the Internet of things is emerging. Consequently, it will be feasible in the future to have real-time energy use for many objects. Thus, their work is a critical first step in learning how we can use wireless metering data streams of object energy usage to change consumption by lowering demand, by shifting demand to times when greener energy is more abundant, or alerting consumers to object use exceptions. Environmental sustainability is a real, colossal, and present problem that must be solved with some haste, in case there is a tipping point beyond which global warming, rising oceans, and ocean acidification cannot be reversed for hundreds of thousands of years, if ever.},

	abstract={The proliferation of mobile devices, ubiquitous internet, and cloud computing has sparked a new era of Internet of Things (IoT), thus allowing researchers to create application-specific solutions based on the interconnection between physical objects and the internet. Recently, wearable devices are rapidly emerging and forming a new segment-'Wearable IoT (WIoT)' due to their capability of sensing, computing and communication. Future generations of WIoT promise to transform the healthcare sector, wherein individuals are seamlessly tracked by wearable sensors for personalized health and wellness information-body vital parameters, physical activity, behaviors, and other critical parameters impacting quality of daily life. This paper presents an effort to conceptualize WIoT in terms of their design, function, and applications. We discuss the building blocks of WIoT-including wearable sensors, internet-connected gateways and cloud and big data support-that are key to its future success in healthcare domain applications. We also present a new system science for WIoT that suggests future directions, encompassing operational and clinical aspects. © 2014 ICST.},

	abstract={Traditionally, the vehicle has been the extension of the man's ambulatory system, docile to the driver's commands. Recent advances in communications, controls and embedded systems have changed this model, paving the way to the Intelligent Vehicle Grid. The car is now a formidable sensor platform, absorbing information from the environment (and from other cars) and feeding it to drivers and infrastructure to assist in safe navigation, pollution control and traffic management. The next step in this evolution is just around the corner: the Internet of Autonomous Vehicles. Pioneered by the Google car, the Internet of Vehicles will be a distributed transport fabric capable to make its own decisions about driving customers to their destinations. Like other important instantiations of the Internet of Things (e.g., the smart building), the Internet of Vehicles will have communications, storage, intelligence, and learning capabilities to anticipate the customers' intentions. The concept that will help transition to the Internet of Vehicles is the Vehicular Cloud, the equivalent of Internet cloud for vehicles, providing all the services required by the autonomous vehicles. In this article, we discuss the evolution from Intelligent Vehicle Grid to Autonomous, Internet-connected Vehicles, and Vehicular Cloud. © 2014 IEEE.},

	abstract={Design and operation of a manufacturing enterprise involve numerous types of decision-making at various levels and domains. A complex system has a large number of design variables and decision-making requires real-time data collected from machines, processes, and business environments. Enterprise systems (ESs) are used to support data acquisition, communication, and all decision-making activities. Therefore, information technology (IT) infrastructure for data acquisition and sharing affects the performance of an ES greatly. Our objective is to investigate the impact of emerging Internet of Things (IoT) on ESs in modern manufacturing. To achieve this objective, the evolution of manufacturing system paradigms is discussed to identify the requirements of decision support systems in dynamic and distributed environments; recent advances in IT are overviewed and associated with next-generation manufacturing paradigms; and the relation of IT infrastructure and ESs is explored to identify the technological gaps in adopting IoT as an IT infrastructure of ESs. The future research directions in this area are discussed. © 2012 IEEE.},

	abstract={The customer domain of the smart grid naturally blends with smart home and smart building systems, but typical proposed approaches are 'distributor-centric' rather than 'customer-centric,' undermining user acceptance, and are often poorly scalable. To solve this problem, we propose a detailed architecture and an implementation of a 'last-meter' smart grid - the portion of the smart grid on customer premises - embedded in an internet-of-things (IoT) platform. Our approach has four aspects of novelty and advantages with respect to the state of the art: 1) seamless integration of smart grid with smart home applications in the same infrastructure; 2) data gathering from heterogeneous sensor communication protocols; 3) secure and customized data access; and 4) univocal sensor and actuator mapping to a common abstraction layer on which additional concurrent applications can be built. A demonstrator has been built and tested with purposely-developed ZigBee smart meters and gateways, a distributed IoT server, and a flexible user interface. © 2014 IEEE.},
