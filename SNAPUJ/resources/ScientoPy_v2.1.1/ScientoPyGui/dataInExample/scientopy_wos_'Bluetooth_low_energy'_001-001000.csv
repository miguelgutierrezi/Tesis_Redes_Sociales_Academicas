Each technology has said that it is superior to other technologies; however, there is no winner as of now. Recent trend is that whoever gets the most users in the market wins. Thus, companies who share mutual understanding began to organize consortiums to develop a common standard technology for IoT. Open Connectivity Foundation (OCF) is a recent case. To disseminate an IoT standard widely, it is very important to keep compatibility with existing technologies already available in the market. One of OCF's major goal is bridging to other ecosystems such as AllJoyn, oneM2M, etc. On the other hand, not only IoT ecosystems but traditional connectivity technologies, such as Bluetooth, ZigBee, Z-wave etc., should also be considered. We call them "legacy devices" in this paper. Legacy device is defined as "IoT devices that work on their own protocol stack and have been sold in the market. They are independent of any IoT ecosystems such as OCF, AllJoyn etc.". In this paper, we propose how OCF devices can be bridged to legacy IoT devices. Bluetooth Low Energy (BLE) device is chosen as the first target legacy IoT device. Reference implementation codes for bridging based on IoTivity is described too.

In the case of outdoor positioning, a global positioning system (GPS) is generally used. There is a limit to the method of using the GPS signal for indoor positioning. A typical indoor positioning method is to use a beacon based on bluetooth low energy (BLE). However, this method has disadvantages that needs to be charged, as well as additional hardware is needed. This paper proposes indoor positioning technology using optical camera communication (OCC) which can overcome these disadvantages of existing positioning method. Especially, this paper proposes a method to acquire the relative location information of the smart device camera of the audience in the concert hall. It is expected that the location information acquired through the proposed method in this paper can be used as application program data that is stored with the captured images and provides various viewpoints.

The application has more valuable features by comparing with common Mobile Crowd Sensing one. First is to support data integrity and utilize simple communication model according to IP-less communication through common CICN features. Secondly, to gather sensing data by using a name including BLE beacon Identifier. The application inherently supports user privacy and data integrity. We deployed several environmental sensors with Raspberry Pis and BLE beacons together in different places across a building. The developed MCS application collects sensing data as the user walks around in a smart building and draws building sensor map. We show implementation result as well as simple analysis work.

However, the development industry has oriented itself among mobile platforms neglecting the standard operating systems and providing only a limited set of integration possibilities most often using a smart-phone, restricting in this way the utility of such sensors in more complex services. In this paper we provide a demonstrator capable of running on a standard Linux host, interacting with two Bluetooth enabled devices and also demonstrate a programmatic approach using the Java language. Furthermore we explain in detail our exploratory methodology and the tools used to achieve our proof-of-concept.

Many technologies have been used for indoor positioning system but requirement is low cost, energy efficient and stable technology. To fulfil this requirement, Bluetooth low energy(BLE) tags are used due to its low cost and energy efficiency for positioning of user in the indoor building. Our approach is deployment of BLE tags on the ceiling of rooms and Received Signal Strength Indicator (RSSI) of tags is calculated. When any smart phone enters within the range of BLE tags which are already deployed in the rooms, the tag with high received signal strength will be nominated and information of that tag along with the information of user will be uploaded to the Web server. And user can see its own location from his smart phone. In this way, it's easy to locate the user inside the building. This method is easy to implement due to its low complexity. In this paper, the department of Telecommunication MUET Jamshoro is used as case study and tracked the working staff within the department.

Areas such as emergency management, home automation and building energy management can benefit from the knowledge of occupants' locations to provide better results and improve their efficiency. Bluetooth Low Energy (BLE) beacons installed inside a building are able to provide information on an occupant's location. Since, however, their operation is based on broadcasting advertisements, they are vulnerable to network security breaches. In this work, we evaluate the effect of two types of spoofing attacks on a BLE based occupancy detection system. The system is composed of BLE beacons installed inside the building, a mobile application installed on occupants mobile phones and a remote control server. Occupancy detection is performed by a classifier installed on the remote server. We use our real-world experimental results to evaluate the impact of these attacks on the system's operation, particularly in terms of the accuracy with which it can provide location information.

PPG signals are influenced by the respiration or breathing process and hence can be used for estimation of respiration rate. R-Band detects the PPG signal that is routed to a Bluetooth low energy device such as a nearby-placed smartphone via microprocessor. Further, we developed an algorithm based on Extreme Learning Machine (ELM) regression for the estimation of respiration rate. We proposed spectral kurtosis features that are fused with the state-of-the-art respiratory-induced amplitude, intensity and frequency variations-based features for the estimation of respiration rate (in units of breaths per minute). In contrast to the neural network (NN), ELM does not require tuning of hidden layer parameter and thus drastically reduces the computational cost as compared to NN trained by the standard backpropagation algorithm. We evaluated the proposed algorithm on Capnobase data available in the public domain.

With the development of wearable sensors and enhanced forms of wireless communication like Bluetooth low energy (BLE) communication, health data can now be collected wirelessly without compromising the independence of patients. Interactive voice interfaces such as the Amazon Echo provide an easy way for individuals to access a variety of data by using voice commands, making interacting with technology easier for those of limited technological experience. Wearable sensors, such as the Angel Sensor, combined with voice interactive devices, such as the Amazon Echo, have allowed for the development of applications that provide easy user interaction. Here, we propose a smart application that monitors health status by combining the data collection capabilities of the Angel sensor and the voice interfacing capabilities of the Amazon Echo. We also present test results of the Amazon Echo speech recognition on different populations.

Introduction of the Global Positioning System (GPS) solved the issue well for outdoor scenarios, however, it is not a reliable solution for indoors, where satellite communication (line-of-sight in general) cannot be maintained. Additionally, there are usually many obstructions (i.e. walls), which block or distort the signals or many signal sources causing interference and noise. Thus, indoor positioning requires different and smarter approaches. iBeacon, is new device-to-device communication technology that relies on Bluetooth Low Energy. In this work, we tested accuracy of a known method used to estimate the distance between two devices communicating through the iBeacon technology. Moreover; effects of the output power, placement of the devices, existence of walls and the possible radio interference, on the accuracy of that distance estimation are investigated.

Bluetooth Low Energy (BLE) is one of these network interfaces and becomes more and more popular because of its energy efficiency and its improved security. The use of random MAC addresses and deep changes in the bluetooth communication procedure were expected to prevent the tracking of individuals through the BLE devices they carries. We reviewed popular devices and found that privacy preserving MAC address are rarely used, even when considering ubiquitous devices that are carried by users all the time. Combined with the new advertising procedure introduced in BLE, this constitute a serious flaw that can be used to track individuals. We investigate its exploitation by BLEB, a BLE Botnet comprise of smartphone and portable devices compromised by a tracking adversary. We investigate the multiple ways to implement it and show that with limited effort, an adversary using BLEB can achieve large scale, high precision and stealthy tracking. A BLEB attack can be more privacy threatening than the ones carried through WiFi or classic bluetooth during their early deployment.

In order to ease testing of the Bluetooth Low Energy interface functionality of the personal health gateway devices, a personal health device simulator was developed. Based on specifications from the Bluetooth SIG a XML software test configuration file structure is defined that declares the specific features of the personal health devices simulated. Using this configuration file, different scenarios are defined, e.g. send a single measurement result from a blood pressure reading or sending multiple (historic) weight scale readings. The simulator is intended to be used for educational purposes in lectures, where the number of physical personal health devices can be reduced and learning can be improved. It could be shown that this simulator assists the development process of mHealth applications by reducing the time needed for development and testing.

Paired with a standard-compliant transmitter, the proposed wakeup receiver method minimizes the overhead in system power, area and complexity. The proposed 2-dimensional wakeup pattern reduces the latency of a wakeup event to below 100 mu s. Supplied at a battery voltage of 2V, the chip fully integrates a power management unit, a wakeup receiver with offset and noise suppression, a low power digital baseband with automatic gain control and RSSI estimation, and a crystal oscillator. With a BLE compliant signal, the chip achieves -58dBm sensitivity, and a >600s mean time without false alarm, consuming 195 mu A.

Therefore, the identification of specific sedentary behaviors (TV viewing, sitting at work, driving, relaxing, etc.) is especially relevant for planning personalized prevention programs. Objective: To build and evaluate a public a dataset for the automatic recognition (classification) of sedentary behaviors. Results: The dataset included data from 30 subjects, who performed 23 sedentary behaviors while wearing a commercial wearable on the wrist, a smartphone on the hip and another in the thigh. Bluetooth Low Energy (BLE) beacons were used in order to improve the automatic classification of different sedentary behaviors. The study also compared six well know data mining classification techniques in order to identify the more precise method of solving the classification problem of the 23 defined behaviors. Conclusions: A better classification accuracy was obtained using the Random Forest algorithm and when data were collected from the phone on the hip. Furthermore, the use of beacons as a reference for obtaining the symbolic location of the individual improved the precision of the classification.

This work focuses on the caracterization and prevention of sedentary lifestyles. A sedentary behavior is defined as "any waking behavior characterized by an energy expenditure of 1.5 METs (Metabolic Equivalent) or less while in a sitting or reclining posture". Objective: To propose a method for sedentary behaviors classification using a smartphone and Bluetooth beacons considering different types of classification models: personal, hybrid or impersonal. Results: Following the CRISP-DM methodology, a method based on a two-layer approach for the classification of sedentary behaviors is proposed. Using data collected from a smartphones' accelerometer, gyroscope and barometer; the first layer classifies between performing a sedentary behavior and not. The second layer of the method classifies the specific sedentary activity performed using only the smartphone's accelerometer and barometer data, but adding indoor location data, using Bluetooth Low Energy (BLE) beacons. To improve the precision of the classification, both layers implemented the Random Forest algorithm and the personal model. Conclusions: This study presents the first available method for the automatic classification of specific sedentary behaviors. The layered classification approach has the potential to improve processing, memory and energy consumption of mobile devices and wearables used.

The older human signal analysis have been a research topic health care fields that algorithms build in wearable device real time detect fall situation. However, the user dynamic sport signal nonlinear relationship between time and environmental uncertainty that are not easy to obtain user fall signal. The Elman neural network has recursive neurons weight that record previous signal and current signal to train neurons. Therefore, we utilize feature of Elman neural network to identify user fall signal. Moreover, we used second-order train method to optimal recursive weight.

In this article we show that such service induces significant threats and we propose a scheme that achieves privacy preserving crowd localization. Crowd localization applications leverage all their users to perform periodic BLE scan and detect the nearby tracked devices. The users run a smartphone application which periodically forwards the list of tracked devices seen in the vicinity. This allows a user to track the mobility of its tracked devices at a large scale. We show that these tags use public or random static addresses that identify the user. These addresses are sent to the tracking company server without modifications. Such a behavior puts unnecessary risk on the users as its mobility can be tracked by the tracking company and by any malicious person with a BLE smartphone. We propose a new architecture that performs crowd localization while preserving users privacy. Our proposal prevent tracking of the users localization by the company as well as any BLE capable adversary. Compared to the current proposals it has no impact on the sensors or smartphone's battery life. It doesn't impair the performance of the crowd localization. Its only downside is a slight increase of the computation cost for the tracking company servers when a user declare the loss of its device.

Based on the PPG and ECG signals, the pulse rate and heart rate could be extracted respectively. Moreover, the pulse transmit time (PTT) could be extracted combining PPG and ECG, which was the key to calculate blood pressure (BP). The circumstance conditions (temperature, humidity and barometric pressure) were detected and displayed on the screen. A motion state was used to toggle the watch screen. Meanwhile all data measured could be sent to an android smart phone, using a Texas Instruments' (TI's) Bluetooth low energy chip CC2540. The PPG wave, ECG wave, heart rate, as well as the systolic blood pressure (SBP) and diastolic blood pressure (DBP) can be displayed on the android client in real time. Compared with the sport band and other smart watches, this multi-parameter health monitoring watch had the advantage of monitoring more parameters. We had made a test to compare this watch with standard equipment, Benavidez T5 and SUNTECH OSAR2, and the result showed that the relative error of heart rate, pulse rate, SBP and DBP against reference were 1.76 +/- 1.64 bpm, 1.76 +/- 1.64 bpm, 4.01 +/- 2.75 mmHg, 4.64 +/- 3.31 mmHg. These results demonstrated that this watch has a broad prospect in the field of mobile health care.

S	Schmidt, M; Obermaisser, R			IEEE	Schmidt, Michael; Obermaisser, Roman			Middleware for the Integration of Bluetooth LE Devices Based on MQTT and ISO/IEEE 11073	2017 IEEE 30TH CANADIAN CONFERENCE ON ELECTRICAL AND COMPUTER ENGINEERING (CCECE)	Canadian Conference on Electrical and Computer Engineering		English	Proceedings Paper	30th IEEE Canadian Conference on Electrical and Computer Engineering (CCECE)	APR 30-MAY 03, 2017	Windsor, CANADA	IEEE				The ISO/IEEE 11073 standard is implemented in the Health Device Profile (HDP) of standard Bluetooth. Therefore the integration of Bluetooth Low Energy (Bluetooth LE) devices is not supported. However the trend in connecting medical and health care devices is going towards Bluetooth LE which allows more energy efficient devices. This paper presents an approach for integrating Bluetooth LE devices into an ISO/IEEE 11073 ecosystem by using an Android smartphone as intermediate and introducing an ISO/IEEE 11073 compliant transcoding agent using the ontologies of ISO/IEEE 11073 for knowledge representation. By introducing an ISO/IEEE 11073 manager with MQTT connectivity, access to the sensor data is available to non ISO/IEEE 11073 compliant applications as well. This allows an easy integration of both ISO/IEEE 11073 and Bluetooth LE sensors in every MQTT supporting middleware or application framework with low effort.

The proposed method combines Wi-Fi fingerprinting and Bluetooth low energy (BLE) trilateration positioning methods. Firstly, the Wi-Fi fingerprinting method estimates the rough position of asset in a large building, provided by mobile device user. Then, when the user approaches the asset, the exact position of asset is estimated by the BLE trilateration method. The experimental result showed that the BLE trilateration positioning achieved 90% accuracy within 1.21 m. Therefore, the proposed method can effectively assist users to locate and track assets in a large building.

The raw data can be processed locally on the wearable device before wirelessly transmitting the mouse-movement reports over Bluetooth Low Energy (BLE) protocol to the host computer; but for exploration of algorithms, the raw data can also be processed on the host. The use of standard Human-Interface Device (HID) profile enables plug-and-play of the proposed mouse device on modern computers without requiring separate driver installation. It can be used in two different modes to move the cursor, the joystick mode and the direct mapped mode. Experimental results show that this head-controlled mouse to be intuitive and effective in operating the mouse cursor with fine-grained control of the cursor even by untrained users.	[Gorji, A.

Each sensor was powered by accumulators charged by an (8 x 14) cm(2) solar panel. The energy budget was carefully managed to allow long operating time for both the moisture sensor and the irrigation automation. We present here the hardware-software setup implemented in our proprietary moisture sensor for wireless communication, using Bluetooth Low Energy modules (BLE). The autonomy of the system may reach 4-5 cloudy days without the need of recharging the accumulators from the sun. Over the entire operating period, the moisture sensors send data wirelessly every sampling time (15 to 30 minutes) following water drips on the soil for the next 30 seconds, pushed by a low power micro pump. The micro-irrigation process is repeated every sampling time, until the soil moisture threshold is reached. In between the operating states, the sensor and watering automation go to sleep. The software algorithm ensures low energy (max. 2.8 mWh) consumption for the moisture sensor and 20 mWh for the irrigation automation, substantially increasing the accumulators discharge cycle.

Relative localization is a particular case where one don't care about an absolute position, but about knowing how far and in which direction an object is from a reference point in an approximate manner. This work makes part of a larger project which aims to track groups of children for preventing hazards. In this paper we present a relative localization system in the form of a distributed multi-hop routing algorithm deployed on a set of wearable Bluetooth Low Energy devices. This paper introduces the distributive algorithm, describes its implementation, and presents performance results which permit to validate the approach and identify the system limitations.

The problem is that updates can be used by attackers to inject malicious code. This work presents a lightweight protocol to update each device in a secure way. The cryptographic keys employed are fresh and are not stored but reconstructed by exploiting the Physical Unclonable Functions (PUFs) of the device hardware. The feasibility of the proposal is illustrated with experimental results of IoT devices that use the SRAM PUFs in their Bluetooth Low Energy (BLE) system on chips.	[Prada-Delgado, M.

Many researches use the Bluetooth Low Energy (BLE) for indoor localization, in particular using the measurement of the Received Signal Strength Indicator (RSSI). This paper presents an inverse model of the distance between two BLE devices depending on the RSSI and on the Packet Error Rate (PER). Furthermore, we derived a model of the accuracy of the estimated distance estimated by the RSSI and PER measurements. Many measurements have been carried out to validate the model.

Performance Analysis of a Probabilistic Local Search Algorithm for Indoor Tracking	COMPUTING IN CIVIL ENGINEERING 2017: SMART SAFETY, SUSTAINABILITY, AND RESILIENCE			English	Proceedings Paper	ASCE International Workshop on Computing in Civil Engineering (IWCCE)	JUN 25-27, 2017	Univ Washington, Seattle, WA	Amer Soc Civil Engineers, Amer Soc Civil Engineers, Comp Div	Univ Washington		CONSTRUCTION; SYSTEM	Many researchers in the construction domain have explored various sensing technologies to acquire location awareness of construction assets. With the use of certain technologies, such as GPS, UWB, and RFID, previous research achieved significant progress for outdoor applications. However, unlike outdoor tracking, indoor environments pose considerable challenges because of the existence of a multitude of interactions among workers, equipment, and materials. These challenges appear in the form of signal interference such as signal degradation, occlusions, obstructions and multipath effects. To overcome signal interference, this study aims to develop and evaluate a probabilistic local search (PLS) algorithm using Bluetooth Low Energy (BLE). This study conducted a site test together with computer simulation to assess the performance of the developed algorithm with respect to accuracy, reliability and robustness. Although the test was conducted in a simple path, noisy data that are generated from the computer simulation reflect the challenges of signal interference, which are expected from occlusions and other objects that potentially introduce signal interference. Based on the test results, the PLS algorithm showed a significant improvement in accuracy, compared with two conventional positioning methods, especially when signal interference exists in the test environment.

At all stages of construction workers are at risk of accidents and serious injury. There are many solutions that tries to address the problems of H&S on the construction sites with different level of their complexity. One of the technology that can be successfully used to improve this part is BLE beacons technology. This technology has been improved recently and provides variety of convenience services. Authors of this work decided to examine Bluetooth devices and performed range test on the devices received from one of the European Beacon producers. Beacons are based on Bluetooth Low Energy (BLE) which is a medium ranged transmission standard aiming for cheaper devices with longer lasting batteries. The main purpose of this article is to present the result of the tests performed in the open area for the purpose of future precise use at the construction site in improving general level of H&S and propose recommendations for further use of BLE devices in construction industry.

The emergence of beacon technology that based on Bluetooth Low Energy (BLE) facilitates the tracking targets in the building (indoor environment). In this paper, we propose tracking system for Alzheimer's patients in hospitals uses beacon technology as a wireless communication medium and Kalman method as data estimator. The experimental results show that the system has been able to track the position of Alzheimer's patients accurately, in which the most optimal position track results obtained when the process noise (Q) 0.1 and noise measurement (R) 0.01 with the average percentage of error only 7.01 % of the actual position.

Especially nowadays sitting periods at work or at home are increasing, and therefore consistent stance monitoring can help users improve their sitting habits and avoid related complications. In this work, we present SPoMo a real-time, practical, wearable system that automatically tracks the user's sitting posture, through wireless sensors attached to his back. Our prototype is based on Inertial Measurement Units (IMUs) that monitor the angle deviation from the optimal position. We have also developed a cloud-assisted mobile application able to continuously visualize the user's stance, archive his performance over time and provide insight for future development of proper posture. We focus on presenting SPoMo functionality and experimentally evaluate its performance. Our results prove our system to be accurate and therefore a good every-day solution that helps the consumer to avoid chronic improper posture.

The system prototype was developed and tested using an electric vehicle (EV) and the respective sensor systems. The main components of the proposed IoT system are: a Bluetooth Low Energy (BLE) intra-vehicular wireless sensor network (IVWSN); a mobile device that acts both as the vehicle's gateway, connecting the IVWSN to the Internet, and as the vehicle's human machine interface (HMI); an online server/database, based on Firebase; a client, which can be either a mobile device or a personal computer; and a residential wireless sensor network (WSN). The use of a wireless network to collect sensor data inside of the vehicle introduces some advantages when compared with conventional wired networks, whereas the inclusion of a residential WSNs in the proposed IoT architecture allows the provision of additional features, such as automatic control of the EV battery charging process. Experimental results are provided to assess the performance of the developed IVWSN and HMI.

By leveraging the tools provided by the Android system to scan and analyze the surrounding environment for Bluetooth Low Energy beacons. The data obtained from the beacons is then broadcasted through the Android system to other applications and Virtual Reality games running on the same Android device. Beacons data contain information about the signal received from each beacon. This data is used to estimate the distance between the beacon and the smartphone. The estimated distance can be used in Virtual Reality applications to change the location of object. The paper proposes a method that achieves the required task from the moment a beacon is detected until the data is passed and used inside the Virtual Reality application. The evaluation of the proposed system is mainly based on the resulted latency, accuracy of the estimated distance and CPU usage. The result shows the latency can be controlled and minimized to ensure smooth Virtual Reality experience.

In this context, the elderly's behavioral analysis through the Internet of Things technologies can help to prevent Mild Cognitive Impairment and frailty problems. In particular, since movements and body motility are good indicators of behavioral changes, this work aims to define a reliable system for controlling the position and the body motility of the elderly in unobtrusive, low-cost and low-power way. The system represents the basis of a complete architecture for behavioral analysis and risk detection developed within the City4Age project, funded by the Horizon 2020 Programme of the European Commission.

Global navigation satellite system (GNSS) is representative, but because of some advantages, Bluetooth low energy (BLE) beacon devices are also attracting attention as an alternative of conventional positioning systems. It is the reason that BLE beacons are small, inexpensive and power-efficient device that appropriate for internet of things (IoT) which is a promising future technology. However, there is a problem that the received signal strength (RSS) is not stable but fluctuating. Moreover, these RSS measurements are measured quite differently in same distance by beacon device, even the beacons are from the same manufacturer. We call this problem in RSS bias problem, and we proposed a method how to find the bias level and how to compensate these biased RSS measurements.

The proposed algorithm reduces the peak load and the electricity bill by shifting the starting times of delay-tolerant home appliances from peak to off-peak hours. However, the maximum allowable delay of the starting time of a home appliance is constrained by a given QoE threshold. Several QoE mapping functions for various appliances were also proposed in this paper. Simulation results indicate that the proposed QoE-aware smart control algorithm significantly reduces the peak load and electricity bill while preserving the user comfort or QoE.

In this scheme, hardware like location tracking devices such as GPS, WiFi positioning system, Bluetooth Low Energy (BLE), and RFID is not required. Instead, the proposed system entirely relies on the existing data in the Hospital Information System (HIS). The data analytics are conducted associated with the preset rules and conditions throughout the system operation, resulting in the generation of the suggestion information for the patients. This scheme does not involve an interaction between patients or any users and readers or sensors. Instead, the scheme completely pushes all information to the patients in a passive way, as opposed to existing approaches that the patients must interact with readers or sensors to determine the location. The proposed method in this paper gives a major impact for hospitals by creating information values out of existing hospital data where was previously invisible to the patients, but is now valuable to them.

New technologies have been developed for both processing and communication modules of such systems that can be used in sensors networks and wearable applications. In this paper two different architectures that use Bluetooth Low Energy (BLE) as communication protocol are analyzed from energy consumption and performance point of view. On one hand we have a system that uses a single chip for processing and BLE communication, while on the other hand an analysis was performed on a system that has different chips for BLE communication and processing. The benchmarks developed include power mode transitions, BLE state consumption and performance analysis of various tasks and in the end comparison between real world wearable applications.

Compared to the traditional environmental sensing with low-power wireless nodes, these new applications generate a constant stream of a much higher rate. Nevertheless, the wearable devices remain battery powered and therefore restricted to low-power wireless standards such as IEEE 802.15.4 or Bluetooth Low Energy (BLE). Our work tackles the problem of building a reliable autonomous schedule for forwarding this kind of dynamic data in IEEE 802.15.4 TSCH networks. Due to the a priori unpredictability of these data source locations, the quality of the wireless links, and the routing topology of the forwarding network, it is wasteful to reserve the number of slots required for the worst-case scenario; under conditions of high expected datarate, it is downright impossible. The solution we propose is a hybrid approach where dedicated TSCH cells and shared TSCH slots coexist in the same schedule.

Despite these promising applications and thorough research, indoor localization remains a very challenging topic and (near) perfect accuracy continues to be an open research challenge. In this paper, we acknowledge the growth and potential of smart home environments and focus on the usage of Bluetooth Low Energy (BLE) for wireless indoor positioning in such cases. This is in contrast with existing work around BLE that more focuses on use-cases in large public areas or buildings. In particular, we compare the applicability of different distance functions for the fingerprinting localization method and propose a dynamic approach of selecting the most suited distance function. Furthermore, we investigate the impact on the quality of the fingerprints by looking at directional fingerprints and search space restrictions. Finally, we discuss the design and usage of a real-life location-aware smart home application, where a user controls the lights in a room through gestures.

CAN bus is very efficient in terms of throughput and reliability but it requires very careful sensor deployment and wiring. In this paper, we propose low cost and energy efficient communication between sensor nodes and ECU using Bluetooth Low Energy (BLE) within Vehicular Ad Hoc Network by employing Intra Vehicle Wireless Sensor Network. BLE can be readily employed in densely urban environment for inter vehicular (up to 50m range) and intra vehicular (up to 10m range) wireless communication. We have compared BLE and CAN bus for communicating actual engine data between ECUs and sensors, and ECU and Onboard Unit (OBU), in terms of energy efficiency, throughput, latency and coverage area. Proposed BLE based system exhibited very high successful packet delivery ratios for static and driving scenarios with acceptable average RSSI values of at least -10dBm. During extensive tests, BLE CC2540/CC2541 based system also achieved very low current consumption (in microamperes) and longer battery life time (around six months on a standard coin battery).

The adaptation technique is applied in the fractional feedback loop to achieve highly accurate target frequency of digitally controlled oscillator (DCO). The range extension feature facilitates the DCO to generate stable frequency under severe phase noise. The polarity control for different BLE frequency channels is also incorporated in the proposed design. The external mode for debugging is embedded in the suggested architecture. The proposed DPFD is integrated in an ADPLL for BLE transceiver. The chip is fabricated with TSMC 55 nm CMOS technology. The DPFD occupies a very small area of 1830 mu m(2) and it requires only 1.906 K gates for its implementation. The current consumption is upto 40 mu A with 1 V power supply and it needs only 40 mu W power for its full operation. The measurement and simulation results verify the functional accuracy of the proposed fully synthsizable DPFD architecture.

The receiver has a measured noise figure of 5.2dB, integrated from 10kHz to 1MHz, that corresponds to a sensitivity of -95.8dBm. At a receiver gain of 47dB, an IIP3 of 19.7dBm has been measured. The LO integrated phase noise at 2.4GHz is 0.83 degrees with LO spot phase noise of -119.9dBc/Hz at 3MHz frequency offset. The PLL is compacted inside the VCO inductor and has LC-VCO with a tuning range of 4.55GHz to 5.15GHz. Multiple mu W-level feedback control loops are used in the design to make it robust over PVT variation. The prototype is implemented in a 40nm LP CMOS process occupying a silicon area of 0.7mm(2).

There are great expectations in using IoT in healthcare, but most studies describe very futuristic and disruptive solutions for the healthcare real world. In a near future these solutions could be implemented, but now we need some "baby steps" to reach an e-Health with IoT technology. In this paper it is presented a solution to transform a doctor's office in an IoT office by helping the doctor attend a patien. This solution has impact in the doctor's work because (s)he has a limited time to attend a patient and a big part of this time is spent writing the results of the appointment in a computer record - the electronic patient record. By other hand the patient improve their experience because the doctor will give them more attention and care.

Fall leads to major injuries, physical disability and sometimes death. Therefore, there is a need to design a dependable embedded system device which will help in detecting the fall and further sends an emergency notification and thus helps in preventing the fall. Many researchers have considered human fall as an unpredictable danger to the life of older generation. Hence lot of research has been done in this area to develop a fall detection system. The existing fall detection systems are efficient but they lack in sensor optimization, early fall detection and efficient wireless communication. In this study, we have demonstrated a pre-fall detection system which detects human falls approximately 250 ms before it occurs. Early fall detection helps in preventing the subject from serious injuries. The designed system monitors user balanced and unbalanced state. Once the unbalance state is detected the system signifies it as a fall, thus gives milliseconds of time to trigger the safety devices like wearable airbag worn by a subject. On fall the system sends emergency notification to the care taker using either Internet of things (IoT) or Bluetooth low energy (BLE). The Hardware system is designed such that it consumes low power and it is a dependable embedded system with easy to wear capabilities for the subject. The designed system uses Arm Processor associated with motion sensors, communication sensors, Signal sensor and MicroSD Card. The software and hardware combination was developed to get optimal low power consumption by switching the CPU between active and sleep mode. The practical experiments performed on the designed system results in giving the 100% sensitivity and 98.07% specificity for fall detection. The wireless communication is efficiently designed such that the power is consumed only when the fall is triggered. The designed system acknowledges the difference between activity of daily living (ADL) like walking, sitting running, and climbing stairs with actual fall.

It is based on the recently introduced hybrid digital phase-locked loop (HDPLL). It features direct frequency modulation of a digitally controlled oscillator (DCO) and a 2nd-order DeltaSigma (Delta Sigma) mixed-signal closed-loop phase/frequency detector (PFD). The Delta Sigma PFD employs charge-pump (CP) PLL front end components for analog quality phase-error detection and a 1st-order Delta Sigma ADC with dynamically adjusted digitization resolution. Digital requantization and noise cancellation facilitate low-power analog implementation. The inherent capability of the Delta Sigma PFD to provide digital frequency error detection feedback allows for robust HDPLL-based TX self-calibration against the processvoltage-temperature (PVT) variations of its analog components.

This work considers human queuing behaviour which is a specific crowd behavior of groups. We design a plug-and-play system solution to the queue detection problem based on Wi-Fi/Bluetooth Low Energy (BLE) received signal strength indicators (RSSIs) captured by multiple signal sniffers. The goal of this work is to determine if a device is in the queue based on only RSSIs. The key idea is to extract features not only from individual device's data but also mobility similarity between data from multiple devices and mobility correlation observed by multiple sniffers. Thus, we propose single-device feature extraction, cross-device feature extraction, and cross-sniffer feature extraction for model training and classification. We systematically conduct experiments with simulated queue movements to study the detection accuracy. Finally, we compare our signal-based approach against camera-based face detection approach in a real-world social event with a real human queue. The experimental results indicate that our approach can reach minimum accuracy of 77% and it significantly outperforms the camera-based face detection because people block each other's visibility whereas wireless signals can be detected without blocking.

Enhancing the Accuracy of iBeacons for Indoor Proximity-based Services	2017 IEEE INTERNATIONAL CONFERENCE ON COMMUNICATIONS (ICC)	IEEE International Conference on Communications		English	Proceedings Paper	IEEE International Conference on Communications (ICC)	MAY 21-25, 2017	Paris, FRANCE	IEEE, IEEE France Sect, IEEE Commun Soc		Location Based Services; iBeacons; Internet of Things; Proximity Detection; Kalman Filter		Proximity-based Services (PBS) require high detection accuracy, energy efficiency, wide reception range, low cost and availability. However, most existing technologies cannot satisfy all these requirements. Apple's Bluetooth Low Energy (BLE), named iBeacon, has emerged as a leading candidate in this domain and has become an almost industry standard for PBS. However, it has several limitations. It suffers from poor proximity detection accuracy due to its reliance on Received Signal Strength Indicator (RSSI). To improve proximity detection accuracy of iBeacons, we present two algorithms that address the inherent flaws in iBeacon's current proximity detection approach. Our first algorithm, Server-side Running Average (SRA), uses the path-loss model-based estimated distance for proximity classification. Our second algorithm, Server-side Kalman Filter (SKF), uses a Kalman filter in conjunction with SRA. Our experimental results show that SRA and SKF perform better than the current moving average approach utilized by iBeacons. SRA results in about a 29% improvement while SKF results in about a 32% improvement over the current approach in proximity detection accuracy.

However, the technology itself is not used optimally owing to the high cost of installation at a base station. To solve this problem, we constructed and operated a system capable of visualizing the location information of a hotel key, and conducted an experiment to verify its functionality. Consequently, we confirmed that it is possible to reduce the base station in the floor plan and behavior model.

In this paper, an 89-mm-long robotic fish is designed and built, which is capable of swimming fast and turning flexibly. This miniature robotic fish is intended to be used as a tool for animal behavioral research and special underwater missions. Compared with traditional design, the propulsion system is characterized by no motor, which is a magnetic actuator. Bluetooth low energy is utilized for remote control, allowing convenient operation via smart devices. By means of law of electromagnetic induction, the relationship between current and magnetic induction intensity is explored. Further, a novel tail-beat rhythm for magnetic actuator is proposed. Meanwhile, a dynamic modeling of fishlike swimming is constructed based on a Lagrange approach to analyze its propulsive performance. Finally, aquatic experiments verify the effectiveness of the formulated magnetically actuated design scheme along with the conducted theoretical analyses.

Towards a rational use of loading and unloading areas in urban environments	REMOTE SENSING TECHNOLOGIES AND APPLICATIONS IN URBAN ENVIRONMENTS II	Proceedings of SPIE		English	Proceedings Paper	Conference on Remote Sensing Technologies and Applications in Urban Environments II	SEP 11-13, 2017	Warsaw, POLAND	SPIE		delivery vehicles; loading/unloading areas; low-cost sensoring; sensor deployment; Bluetooth Low Energy; beacons; pollution; smart cities; transportation; vehicles		Despite the efforts of the authorities, that promote the use of alternative transportation systems, the traffic still increases in European cities, leading not only to traffic jams but also to pollution episodes. Delivery vehicles are part of both problems, because of their intensive use, the advent of e-commerce, the limited number and sizes of loading and unloading areas in many ancient European cities, and the difficulties associated to keep track of the correct use of these spaces. In this work we propose an holistic solution to the management of delivery vehicles in urban environments. Our solution, called RYDER, is based on the use of BLE (Bluetooth Low Energy) devices that should be provided by the local authority to delivery vehicles, as part of their authorization to use the loading and unloading areas. With the help of low-cost, low-power antennas with Bluetooth and 4G capabilities installed next to each loading/unloading area, the authorities are able to know in real time (a) the use of these areas by delivery vehicles, (b) the paths of the vehicles while they travel across the city, (c) the time spent in each area by each one of them, and (d) with the help of a mobile/tablet App, the local Police can check in seconds the permissions of each vehicle using these public spaces. Moreover, the use of a GIS-based platform allows the Traffic Department to track online each particular vehicle, based on the loading/unloading spaces being used, and to infer the most representative paths they follow, an information that may guide the decision about where these spaces are really necessary and whether each particular vehicle follows their associated usage rules. The deployment of RYDER low-cost antennas can also serve for other purposes, such as to track the routes followed by public loan bicycles, or by other fleets of public vehicles. With the help of low-cost sensors, antennas can also return an estimation of pollution values, such as levels of ozone, particulate matter, carbon monoxide, sulfur dioxide, and nitrous oxide, among others. This information may in turn drive the installation of certified pollution detectors.

BLE is designed as a radio standard that minimizes power consumption and it is particularly suited for low cost, low bandwidth, low power, and low complexity applications. These aspects of the standard represent the reasons of its success in the field of biometric monitoring sensors. The aim of this paper is to present a performance evaluation of a Body Area Network System based on Bluetooth Smart. The evaluation is performed on a real test-bed, composed of off-the-shelf BLE devices. The BLE devices are equipped with software tools developed specifically for this work.

Mainly, wearable devices are going to have a large impact on our lifestyle, especially in a healthcare scenario. In this framework, it is fundamental to secure exchanged information between these devices. Among other factors, it is important to take into account the link between a wearable device and a smart unit (e.g., smartphone). This connection is generally obtained via specific wireless protocols such as Bluetooth Low Energy (BLE): the main topic of this work is to analyse the security of this communication link. In this paper we expose, via an experimental campaign, a methodology to perform a vulnerability assessment (VA) on wearable devices communicating with a smartphone. In this way, we identify several security issues in a set of commercial wearable devices.

The next fast growing opportunity market will be the Internet of Things (IoT) and Wearable Deivces in the near future. This advanced technology/package need to provide the ideal solution for small form factor, thin profile, high electrical performance, multi-function integration and low cost are the most critical requirements. To approach these requirements, the System in Package (SiP) is a combination of one or more semiconductor devices plus optionally passive components that define a certain functional block within a small package, mounted onto the system's main board assembly. SiP can be integrated multi-function chips into a single package and offer a small form factor and a low cost system solution for many wireless connectivity applications. In this paper, an alternative 3D small form factor SiP methodology will use surface mount technology (SMT) and 3D structure of stacking die on passives to shrink the package size. The calculation of package size can be shrunk around 25% area and package size reduced from 11.5 x 11.5mm to 10x10mm. For the experiment including the DOE (Design of Experiment) study for the passive quantities optimization and also die tilt performance between different passive quantities. By utilizing exiting package solutions (such as wire bond, flip chip, hybrid or stacked die process), a SiP module provide a unique opportunity to address cost, performance, and time-to-market. Considering the limitations of power consumption and form factor, such as Bluetooth Low Energy (BLE), and wireless connectivity module will become the major requirements for SiP platforms in near marketing. The characterization analysis will utilize simulation methodology & typical reliability testing (Temperature Cycle Test, High Temperature Storage Test, unbias HAST) results as a verification for 3D stacking die on passives of SiP feasibility structure. Finally, this paper will find out the suitable 3D stacking die on passives of SiP structure and feasibility data for future IoT and wearable devices application.

BLE is also increasingly used in critical infrastructure applications, primarily in wireless sensor networks (WSN) for healthcare and environmental monitoring. While much research addresses the implementation and resiliency of these types of networks, little research focuses on detection of attacks on WSN sensors. To that extent, research that focuses on detection of attacks on BLE devices is lacking. Furthermore, BLE security research lags behind attack tool development. The general lack of security has led to recent development of two separate BLE man-in-the-middle frameworks, a privacy-violating BLE localization tool, and successful attacks on 12 commercially available BLE locks. To enable post-production updates, several vendors include the capability to alter device firmware over-the-air using BLE. Unfortunately, the standard service used for this purpose does not require authentication and has no built-in security. Consequently, a malicious actor can exploit the update mechanism to download malware to a target BLE device. This work contributes to the field of WSN and BLE security by illustrating an example attack methodology through a firmware exploit on a BLE industrial monitor. The attack vector is presented in its entirety, from target selection and enumeration to exploitation and malware deployment. Challenges in detection for this attack are presented from the perspective of a peripheral, end user, and third-party traffic sniffer. An experiment is designed to illustrate an additional challenge with sniffer-based detection, where some sniffers become less effective at capturing traffic over time. A mechanism for firmware recovery is proposed, emphasizing its difficulty for a normal end user, and further motivating the need for attack detection mechanisms. Finally, actionable steps are provided for vendors and end users to help defend BLE devices and enhance application security.

The Bluetooth protocol is utilized in many low-cost devices to implement wireless data transmission. We begin by framing Bluetooth as two distinct protocols: Bluetooth Classic (BTC) and Bluetooth Low Energy (BLE). We evaluate currently available Bluetooth penetration testing tools including Bluelog, BTscanner, Redfang, Spooftooph, BlueRanger, Bluesnarfer, BlueMaho, Bluepot, Ubertooth, Crackle, BTLEJuice, Gattacker, and Blue Hydra for both BTC and BLE. The survey demonstrates that these tools have a limited range of capabilities and most tools are only compatible with a single protocol, but not both. This discovery motivates the development of BlueFinder, an open-source range-finding tool compatible with both BTC and BLE devices. We evaluate BlueFinder in both line-of-sight (LOS) and beyondline-of-sight (BLOS) environments to develop a distance estimation technique based off the log-distance path loss model. The model generates parameters by minimizing the mean absolute percentage error (MAPE). Data is collected by quantifying the received signal strength (RSS) of incoming packets at varying distances and recording their values for later statistical evaluation. The model distance estimate is a function of three parameters: reference distance, RSS, and the path loss exponent. A calibration test run utilizes experimental and iterative simulation techniques to produce the model parameter values. Initial experiments show that statistically meaningful results are not achieved by using raw RSS alone, so we use mean RSS to achieve a fit with less than 20% MAPE at distances ranging up to 1,000 meters. The model is validated against a BTC electrocardiogram machine and a BLE wearable heart rate monitor in a warwalking scenario. An evaluation between BlueFinder and Blue Hydra finds that our model provides a significant improvement when operating at distance greater than 50 meters.

These internet-on-chip devices support different protocols (Bluetooth, ZigBee, Bluetooth Low Energy, sub-GHz links), from about 300 MHz to 6 GHz, with max. sustained bit-rates from 250 kb/s (sub-GHz links) to 4 Mb/s (Wi-Fi), and different trade-offs between RX sensitivity (from -74 to -100 dBm), RX noise figure (few dB to 10 dB), maximum TX power (from 0 to 22 dBm), link distances, power consumption levels (from few mW to several hundreds of mW). One limit for their successful application is the missing of an easy-to-use modeling and simulation environment to plan their deployment. The need is to predict, before installing a network, at which distances the sensors can be deployed, the real achievable bit-rate, communication latency, outage probability, power consumption, battery duration. To this aim, this paper presents the H(2)AWKS (Harsh environment and Hardware Aware Wireless linK Simulator) simulator, which allows the planning of a WSAN taking into account environment constraints and hardware parameters. Applications of H2AWKS to real WSAN case studies prove that it is an easy to use simulation environment, which allows design exploration of the system performance of a WSAN as a function of the operating environment and of the hardware parameters of the used devices.

It defines language and cognitive skills as an operant repertoire of responses to arbitrarily related stimuli specific, as far as is now known, of the human species. RFT has been proved useful in addressing cognitive barriers to human action in psychotherapy and also improving children skills in reading, IQ testing, and in metaphoric and categorical repertoires.

It is well-known that localization based on RSSI measurements can only be achieved with a limited accuracy when applying these values directly to respective path loss models. Therefore additional signal processing is performed on the RSSI values and an auto-calibration approach is proposed, which takes inconsistencies with respect to environmental textures into account. The respective model parameters can be thus matched and updated in regular intervals. Further improvements are obtained by performing distance estimation in both directions, namely from transmitter to receiver and vice versa. Furthermore a sophisticated post processing of the RSSI values is performed. Compared to established RSSI-based localization methods based on low-power, low-cost systems, the localization accuracy has been significantly improved by applying the proposed methods. This is verified by measurements using an experimental setup.

In this work, we introduce a Bluetooth Low Energy-based infrastructure for locationaware buildings, along with a full-scale real-subject trial. The trial was undertaken with students in our engineering building at NCState, under IRB approval. Our focus is on showing a proof-of-concept of deploying location-aware infrastructure through experimentally collecting data able to facilitate building management and user localization. We examine a multi-floor environment installation and analytically prove how viable and economic our solution is to equip future intelligent facilities.

BLESS: Bluetooth Low Energy Service Switching using SDN	2017 IEEE CONFERENCE ON COMPUTER COMMUNICATIONS WORKSHOPS (INFOCOM WKSHPS)	IEEE Conference on Computer Communications Workshops		English	Proceedings Paper	IEEE Conference on Computer Communications Workshops (INFOCOM WKSHPS)	MAY 01-04, 2017	Atlanta, GA	IEEE				Bluetooth Low Energy (BLE) is a low-energy personal area wireless network technology that is of increasing importance for large-scale Internet of Things (IoT) deployment. By design, BLE is localized to small regions and to simple network topologies. Moreover, it is not designed for dynamic enforcement of policy and access controls. These limitations are impediments to BLE based IoT service deployment, where IoT devices for a service may need to be grouped into a network slice spanning a sizable geographic region and with strong perslice policy enforcement. This paper presents an architecture for creating wide-area IoT service slices which utilize BLE devices at the edge. For this, we introduce an SDN-controlled "switch node", called BLE service switch (BLESS) that is transparently inserted between two communicating BLE devices. It can be programmed at the service layer by a central controller and enables flexible, policy-based switching between the devices. We describe the design of BLESS, and illustrate its utility through a few practical use cases.	[Uddin, Mostafa; Mukherjee, Sarit; Chang, Hyunseok; Lakshman, T.

Furthermore, a flooding avoidance approach is adopted by the proposed scheme to minimize the number of route request packets flooded. In addition, the proposed scheme maximizes network lifetime by using residual battery and RSSI as a route metric. The simulation results confirmthat our proposed scheme has a surpassing performance with regard to network lifetime, evenly distributed battery consumption, and route discovery latency compared with the traditional on-demand routing protocol.

In this paper, we study the accuracy of a time synchronization scheme based on generation of an event in the application program at the time of BLE connection establishment. We discuss the background of the problem, explain the method of measurement used to evaluate the solution in detail, and present the results of time synchronization based on a practical BLE platform. We also explain the relationship between the time synchronization and BLE configuration parameters. The results of our experiments indicate that the accuracy of our time synchronization during connection establishment is around +/- 750 mu s.	[Dian, F.

One emerging group of these is called wearable devices. The wireless technologies used by wearable devices need to consider the long lasting of battery life. Consequently, Bluetooth Low Energy (BLE) has emerged as the wireless technologies for wearable devices due to its features of low power consumption. In this research we focus on enabling technologies that will facilitate seamless communications between the wearable devices and the oneM2M platform based on BLE. We evaluate three different designs: (1) IPE (Inter-working Proxy Application Entity), (2) RESTful BLE and (3) 6LoWPAN over BLE. Our research compares and evaluates the main features and behaviors of these three designs and investigates key performance indicators of each such as power consumption, system performance, transmission efficiency and design complexity. With our research we are able to determine which specific design is most suitable for wearable devices under different system design requirements.

Finding objects using UWB or BLE localization technology: A museum-like use case	2017 INTERNATIONAL CONFERENCE ON INDOOR POSITIONING AND INDOOR NAVIGATION (IPIN)	International Conference on Indoor Positioning and Indoor Navigation		English	Proceedings Paper	8th International Conference on Indoor Positioning and Indoor Navigation (IPIN)	SEP 18-21, 2017	Sapporo, JAPAN	IEEE, Hokkaido Univ, Grad Sch Informat Sci & Technol, SECOM		UWB; BLE; Distance Measurement; localization; Finding objects; Estimote; Bespoon	NLOS IDENTIFICATION; POSITIONING SYSTEMS; MITIGATION; NETWORKS	Some location-aware use cases imply that a person desires to find an object relative to his position. This is the case of museum visits or any indoors/outdoors activity where the objects of interest are not geo-referenced or even can move with time. For these use cases, a user does not need an absolute localization, but a relative information consisting of the range to the object and the heading angle between that object and the user's moving direction. In this paper we study two different radio technologies for finding an object of interest: Ultra-Wide-Band (UWB) and Bluetooth Low Energy (BLE). Range and orientation estimation performance is studied when using just the distance or the Received-Signal-Strength (RSS) provided by UWB and BLE systems, respectively. Both approaches are combined with Pedestrian Dead-reckoning (PDR) estimation in order to analyze the benefits that PDR information provides. For completeness we compare the cases where only one tag is fixed to the object to locate (the simpler and more flexible case) with the more ideal case where several geo-referenced objects of interest, each one with a tag, jointly cooperate to improve the relative location to one of the objects of interest (in both cases the user carries a mobile phone with BLE 4.0 or UWB radio). The UWB ranging radio, not common in most smartphones, but very accurate, is used as our reference to define the best achievable performance goal, in order to compare with BLE RSS-based performance. We demonstrate that the common BLE low ranging-accuracy technology combined with smartphone-based PDR estimation is capable, after some initial user's walking, of finding with decent range and heading accuracy the objects of interest in a museumlike set-up.

Multiple indoor positioning algorithms have been researched and improved to provide better accuracy. For the purpose of the internet of things Bluetooth 4 (BLE) was introduced. However, a Bluetooth 4 signal is highly affected by obstruction attenuation and multipath. Deploying the BLE beacon could impose a significant cost if a large number of beacons need to be employed to avoid the obstacle attenuation and multipath effects. This paper proposes an algorithm to identify a beacon placed in a different room (isolated beacon). The proposed algorithm has a 68% probability of estimating the correct condition with an accuracy of up to 78% for a high attenuation obstruction. By implementing the algorithm, the results show an average accuracy improvement of 48% with RMSE error decreasing from 7.8 metres to 4.64 metres.

The commonly used indoor location detection methods are Wi-Fi positioning, Bluetooth Low Energy (BLE) beacons and Pedestrian Dead-reckoning (PDR). PDR can provide location information relative to the original position by analyzing acceleration and angular velocity using sensors in smartphones without needing any positioning equipment in the environment. Meanwhile, to know the user's context in the indoor environment, PDR, RFID and surveillance cameras are investigated. Although PDR results can provide the atomic physical behavior such as the direction of walking (forward/backward or right/left), it is difficult to detect the user's shopping behaviors to determine if he/she is approaching, searching or just browsing in the shopping venues. Our research objective is to estimate the user's walking context appropriate for shopping venues with the same sensor information as used for conventional PDR. We propose a new method for walking context recognition that uses machine learning with a feature vector of accelerometers and gyroscopes. Based on the experiments conducted, we found that this model was able to recognize the intuitive walking context. We also established the utility of our proposal in the experiment at the actual shopping venue and verified that it can be applied to improve PDR positioning precision by 8%.

One of the common drawbacks of FP is the large data size and consequently the large search space and computational load as a result of either vastness of the positioning area or the finer resolution in the FP grid map. This complexity can be limited reducing the RSSI quantization till to a simple binary indicator at the expense of an increased number of reference points or beacons. This approach turns out to be advantageous for the deployment of FP systems based on diffused beacons equipped with inexpensive technologies, such as Bluetooth Low Energy (BLE) or other technologies for the Internet of Things (IoT). An appropriate quantization and design of RSSI signatures will make possible the deployment of FP in larger areas maintaining the same computational load and/or the desired localization performance. The experimental results confirm promising computational savings without a relevant impact on the localization performance.

Co-ordinate location can be estimated using radio fingerprinting techniques applied to Received Signal Strength (RSS) values from BLE beacons. Earlier work on BLE fingerprinting has noted that the separate BLE advertising channels can exhibit different RSS values, although modern consumer devices do not provide channel information and therefore report a composite RSS with artificially inflated variance that can lead to reduced positioning accuracy. In this work we quantify how often this channel dispersion occurs in typical environments, what the extent of the dispersion is, and what impact it has on positioning. Furthermore we explore how to obtain channel information when using today's consumer devices. We find that the dispersion is both common and significant and leads to significantly reduced positioning accuracy; in our experiments only 10% of composite variances were within 1 dBm of an individual channel's variance, and 40% of composite variances were at least 4 dBm greater. We also show that the behaviour of the channels is sufficiently distinct that a fingerprinting scheme that uses a signal map for each achieves significantly increased positioning accuracy (up to 3 m).

One of the key concepts in this layer is the possibility for creating multiple Link Layer state machines (often abstracted as roles), which are able to run concurrently within the same physical device. As BLE is one of the most important technologies in the Internet of Things (IoT), this functionality attracted many researchers and developers. Possibly the most well-known state machine combination is the Advertiser-Scanner, that is used in relay devices of every multihop communication solution based on the broadcast mesh approach, but in other application areas there can occur many other combinations also, especially if one takes into consideration the edge (or fog) computing concept in the IoT world. For being capable to assess the key performance metrics (e.g. delay, throughput, etc.) of these state machines running concurrently on the same device, there was a simulator developed, which is presented in this paper, as well as the analysis of different scenarios (including their practical occurrence, possible bottlenecks and workarounds) based on the results obtained with it.

Current models of care and pathways require transforming to become more citizen focused and support greater community resilience and sustainability. This will require different approaches to innovation to improve quality of life for people as they age, reduce onset of frailty as well as support those better with long term conditions around self-management and prevention strategies. Health and social care providers are looking at how they augment traditional clinical health related services with the use of IoT technologies and smart city services. This paper describes the on-going work of the Birmingham City4Age pilot, managed by the local authority, Birmingham City Council and funded by the Horizon 2020 Programme of the European Commission focused on the unobtrusive collection of data via wearable devices, outdoor sensors and other smart city systems that aims to help reduce the onset of frailty of older people. Locality and contextual data is being captured on individuals' behaviours with increased frequency that aims to help in detecting early changes in daily living - physical activity and social patterns and develop technology based interventions to help reduce the risk of frailty. The proposed systems architecture is being validated in two distinct neighbourhoods with contrasting demographics in Birmingham, UK adopting an iterative user design approach designed to support independence.

But how does this affect learning on the job scenarios. The research project HANDELkompetent aims at digitization of work process integrated informal learning in retail with a methodological approach and a supporting digital learning environment. The method consists of an accompanied learning approach, where a dedicated person schedules the development of competences of staff in dialog. Learning content consists of small web-based trainings, i.e. learning-nuggets, which can be consumed in a few minutes. The learning environment is enhanced with a tablet pc app, which presents learning content to a learner. The app is enabled to deliver appropriate content to the learner by recognizing the learning situation by making use of device sensors, the actual competences of a learner and the target competences as registered in the learning environment. That means in detail that a learning position, e.g. cash point, warehouse or sales floor is tagged with iBeacons. Those iBeacons broadcast their identification via Bluetooth Low Energy. The tablet PC of a learner can identify these iBeacons and thus, the app determines the physical location of the learner. Besides the position the app can utilize microphone, camera or a brightness sensor for gathering context information, to derive the learning situation and to deliver appropriate content. We make use of the Digital Business Engineering Framework to structure our work. Digital Business Engineering is a methodological framework to deliver sustainable solutions for Digital Transformation. This paper shows our structural approach and first results of the development phase of the HANDELkompetent project. (C) 2017 The Authors. Published by Elsevier B.V.

During the last two decades, sensor networks transferred from wired [1] to wireless sensor networks [2]. Several methods exist to measure moisture in building materials. Most of the introduced commercial moisture measurement methods provide information about the local or near surface moisture. A feasibility study is presented to demonstrate, how the Received Signal Strength Indicator (RSSI) of a Bluetooth Low Energy (BLE) signal, transmitted from the BLE-module embedded in building materials, correlate with changing moisture content. The feasibility of this influence was investigated in the presented study. The maximum and minimum RSSI were systematically recorded and analysed. (C) 2017 Elsevier Ltd. All rights reserved.

Our idea has extended common participatory sensing systems to realize more practical sensing systems because common participatory sensing mechanisms require a participants' operation to measure some values. Our proposed system consists of a BLE devices on a bus, smartphone applications on a participants' smartphone, and a cloud service. The BLE device has a GPS (Global Positioning System) receiver and a communication function based on the BLE specification. The BLE device also activates a neighbor smartphone application by transmitting a special beacon message. Hence, the smartphone application can work and obtain the bus location from BLE device even if it was a suspended status. Additionally, it also uploads the bus location to the cloud service automatically. As a result, the proposed system can collect a bus location from BLE devices through smartphones automatically. The demonstration shows a prototype system based on the proposed idea for a bus location system.

The present transmissions are emitted by dedicated radio frequency sources, such as Bluetooth Low Energy (BLE) beacons, mounted to the vehicle to determine the driver/passenger(s) proximity or relative position(s). Based on empirical data, a model of the measurements noise, which utilises skewed distributions, is proposed to capture inconsistencies in reception and the impact of occlusions on the RSSI profile in an automotive setting, for example occlusions in car parks. Experimental data is used to demonstrate the suitability of the introduced model.

Study presented in this paper explores BLE localization performance in indoor scenarios based on a received signal strength (RSS). Firstly, we present a Ray-Launching based application to emulate BLE radio frequency (RF) signal propagation in the office environment. Secondly, an appropriate measurement workplace and its setup is proposed to measure RSS values. Obtained results are used to create an RSS-fingerprinting map. Furthermore, accuracy of position determination is calculated and evaluated. Results show advantage of BLE technology for indoor localization purposes (without calibration measurement). However, its performance highly depends on the number of considered BLE nodes and on applied evaluation method (e.g. number of considered sectors).

Sensors of this type are found attached almost to every body segment, capable of delivering signals even in harsh activity scenarios. The reliability and relevance of the physiological data retrieved by wearables have yet to surpass the conventional technologies in the healthcare system today. In this paper we present a small device incorporated inside an headphone set that continuously monitors the ECG, impedance and acceleration of the head. As opposed to most biometric sensors, ECG measurement relies on non-optical methods by capturing the electrical potential around the ear in both sides of the head, whereas impedance monitoring involves AC stimulation instead of DC, the latter commonly involved in skin galvanic response estimation. Signal processing of impedance parameters is performed in situ using a fast variant of the Discrete Fourier Transform in order to save computational resources and power expenditure from a microcontroller equipped with Bluetooth Low Energy. Applications that can benefit from this device include cardiovascular and stress level assessment of individuals	[Rosa, Bruno M.

Aiming for a low maintenance system, SPW-1 is able to offer a battery lifetime of multiple months. Measurements on its wireless performance in a real residential environment with thick brick walls, demonstrate that SPW-1 can fully cover a room and - in most cases - the adjacent room, as well. SPW-1 is a research platform that is aimed to be used both as a data collecting tool for health-oriented studies outside the laboratory, but also for research on wearable technologies and body-centric communications. As a result, SPW-1 incorporates versatile features, such as external sensor support, various powering options, and accelerometer configuration options that can support a wide range applications from kinematics to long-term activity recognition.

Despite the huge efforts made for localization using smartphone inertial sensors, its performance is still unsatisfactory in large open areas, such as halls, supermarkets, and museums, due to accumulated errors arising from the uncertainty of users' mobility and fluctuations of magnetic field. Regarding that, this paper presents iBILL, an indoor localization approach that jointly uses iBeacon and inertial sensors in large open areas. With users' real-time locations estimated by inertial sensors through an improved particle filter, we revise the algorithm of augmented particle filter to cope with fluctuations of magnetic field. When users enter vicinity of iBeacon devices clusters, their locations are accurately determined based on received signal strength of iBeacon devices, and accumulated errors can, therefore, be corrected. Proposed by Apple Inc. for developing LBS market, iBeacon is a type of Bluetooth low energy, and we characterize both the advantages and limitations of localization when it is utilized. Moreover, with the help of iBeacon devices, we also provide solutions of two localization problems that have long remained tough due to the increasingly large computational overhead and arbitrarily placed smartphones. Through extensive experiments in the library on our campus, we demonstrate that iBILL exhibits 90% errors within 3.5 m in large open areas.

J	Liang, ZL; Ogi, T				Liang, Zulin; Ogi, Tetsuro			The UHD Navigation Signage System: multi-to-multi interaction approach with smartphone	JOURNAL OF ADVANCED MECHANICAL DESIGN SYSTEMS AND MANUFACTURING			English	Article						Beacon; Digital signage; UHD (Ultra High Definition); BLE (Bluetooth Low Energy); 4K; Wayfinding; Navigation system; Smartphone; WebGL; WebSocket	DISPLAY	Digital Signage has been evolved continuously over the years, and it has shown the potential in application of navigation recently. Comparing to conventional usage of advertisement and broadcasting, the interacting with digital signage has gained great interest for researchers due to hot issue of Internet of Thing. In these days, the ubiquity of smartphone and the development of sensor make it possible to apply more intuitive interaction with digital signage. A new navigation system which combined UHD (Ultra High Definition) display with personal smartphone is proposed. User is allowed to control Web-based 3D model instead of 2D subway map through smartphone's gyroscope sensor. In this paper, multi user access approach is proposed by applying multi sub screen in UHD Signage system with BLE (Bluetooth Low Energy) tech and a novel WebSocket server design. Different from one-to-one control, this approach provides multi-to-multi accessibility that allows multiple users to access the navigation system simultaneously. A novel Web Socket server design reduces the delay and provides better control experience for multiple users' accession. This technology makes user able to access system sequentially, according to the access time and the distance between user and signage. The distance information is provided by iBeacon which attached to the UHD display. The result shows better feasibility when applied this navigation system to solve wayfinding problem inside complex subway station.

Since BLE4.0 is highly sensitive to fast fading impairments, numerous ongoing studies are currently exploring the use of supervised learning algorithm as an alternative approach to exploit the information provided by the indoor radio maps. Despite the large number of results reported in the literature, there are still many open issues on the performance evaluation of such approach. In this paper, we start by identifying, in a simple setup, the main system parameters to be taken into account on the design of BLE4.0 beacons-based indoor localization mechanisms. In order to shed some light on the evaluation process using supervised learning algorithm, we carry out an in-depth experimental evaluation in terms of the mean localization error, local prediction accuracy, and global prediction accuracy. Based on our results, we argue that, in order to fully assess the capabilities of supervised learning algorithms, it is necessary to include all the three metrics.

The platform aims to allow all the researchers to start IoT research, such as activity recognition and context estimation, easily and efficiently. The most important contribution is the hardware that we have designed. Various sensors often used for research are embedded in an ultra tiny board with the size of 50 mm (W) x 10 mm (H) x 5 mm (D) and weight around 3 g including a battery. Concretely, the following sensors are embedded on this board: acceleration, gyro, magnetic, light, UV, temperature, humidity, and pressure. In addition, this board has BLE (Bluetooth low energy) connectivity and capability of a rechargeable battery. By using 110 mAh battery, it can run more than 15 hours. The most different point from other similar boards is that our board has a large flash memory for logging all the data without a smartphone. By using SenStick, all the users can collect various data easily and focus on IoT data analytics. In this paper, we introduce SenStick platform and some case studies. Through the user study, we confirmed the usefulness of our proposed platform.

People suffering from a variety of diseases had been traditionally treated in hospitals for a long time. Fortunately, the current situation has been changing also thanks to relatively cheap body sensors and development of systems for home treatment. It brings inconsiderable cost savings and improves patients' comfort. On the other hand, it puts demands on the used technical infrastructure and home treatment system developers who must solve integration of different systems. A crucial point is a definition of unified data formats facilitating transfer and storage of data to/in remote databases. There are standards and APIs such as Zigbee, Bluetooth low energy or ANT+ that define a protocol for data transfer. However, they do not define a suitable format for long term data storing. In this paper, data coming from ANT+ sensors have been studied and metadata related to all kinds of body sensors and raw data and metadata specific to individual sensors have been defined. Then a framework organizing data and metadata obtained from ANT+ sensors into an open and general data format suitable for long term storage of sensor data is introduced. Finally, a sample use-case showing the transfer of data from a sensor into a data storage is presented.

In this regard, methods are being developed for highest accuracy indoor locating performance with least cost. Among these methods localization with fingerprinting is far more superior to other indoor localization methods as it uses the surrounding signals in the environment for accurate positioning and is available to most common mobile devices. In this work, indoor fingerprinting algorithms for localization of mobile devices based on Correlation Database (CDB) Filtering, Genetic Algorithm (GA) and Big Bang-Big Crunch (BB-BC) are compared.

Many research groups are studying pervasive solutions to continuously and unobtrusively monitor fragile subjects at their homes, reducing health-care costs and supporting medical diagnosis. Among the several behavioral aspects which clinicians are interested in monitoring, anomalous behaviors while performing activities of daily living are of great importance. In this work, we aim at improving the state of the art on this topic by enabling the recognition of fine-grained anomalies by detecting specific object manipulations. We attach tiny Bluetooth Low Energy accelerometers to several household objects in order to detect which manipulations are performed by the inhabitant on which object. Detected manipulations, combined with data from other environmental sensors deployed in the home, are used to infer ADLs and fine-grained abnormal behaviors. Preliminary results on a dataset with hundreds of complex activities captured in a smarthome environment show the effectiveness of the proposed method.

The use of cellular infrastructure requires contracts and complex radios that are often too power hungry and cost prohibitive for sensing applications that require just a few bits of data each day. New low-power, sub-GHz, long-range radios are an ideal technology to help fill this communication void by providing access points that are able to cover multiple kilometers of urban space with thousands of end-point devices. These new Low-Power WideArea Networking (LPWAN) platforms provide a cost-effective and highly deployable option that could piggyback off of existing public and private wireless networks (WiFi, Cellular, etc). In this paper, we present OpenChirp, a prototype end-toend LPWAN architecture built using LoRa Wide-Area Network (LoRaWAN) with the goal of simplifying the design and deployment of Internet-of-Things (IoT) devices across wide areas like campuses and cities. We present a software architecture that exposes an application layer allowing users to register devices, describe transducer properties, transfer data and retrieve historical values. We define a service model on top of LoRaWAN that acts as a session layer to provide basic encoding and syntax to raw data streams. At the device-level, we introduce and benchmark an open-source hardware platform that uses Bluetooth Low-Energy (BLE) to help provision LoRa clients that can be extended with custom transducers. We evaluate the system in terms of end-node energy consumption, radio penetration into buildings as well as coverage provided by a network currently deployed at Carnegie Mellon University.

The aim of this study is to design and develop a reliable and robust wireless network that can eradicate accessibility of a device's human interface. An embedded system supplied by an energy harvesting source, installed on the portable computer device, may represent one of multiple slave nodes which request regular updates from a standalone master station. A portable computer device which is operated in an undesignated area or in a field perimeter where master to slave communication is restricted, indicating a possible theft scenario, will initiate a shutdown of its operating system and render the device unusable. Consequently, an algorithm in the device firmware may ensure the necessary steps are executed to track the device, irrespective whether the device is enabled. Design outcomes thus far indicate that a wireless network using low-power embedded hardware, is feasible for anti-theft applications. By incorporating one of the latest Bluetooth low-energy, ANT+, ZigBee or Thread wireless technologies, an anti-theft system may be implemented that has the potential to reduce major portable computer device theft in institutions of digitized learning.

However, the Global Positioning System, currently the most widely used positioning technology, cannot provide accurate positioning services when obstructed by obstacles. Consequently, this system can only provide outdoor application services such as outdoor navigation and tracking. In 2013, Apple Inc. released iBeacon, a positioning technology based on Bluetooth low energy (BLE). This device transmits Bluetooth signals within a specific range, in which the signals are received by other smartphones to calculate distances for providing indoor positioning-related services. In this study, the iBeacon transmission power level is adjusted to significantly increase Bluetooth signal differences in indoor environments. Therefore, it can reduce received signal strength indicators (RSSI) similarity for some reference points by adjusting the power level. Subsequently, radio frequency signals are filtered using a modified moving average filter to reduce signal variations after reception. Next, pattern matching and the K-Nearest Neighbors (KNNs) algorithm are integrated to facilitate positioning. The integration of the modified moving average filter with the KNNs algorithm increases the positioning accuracy by 23.08% during the online phase. This finding can thus improve location-based services.

Specifically, we focus on IoT devices based on Bluetooth Low Energy (BLE) Technology, which is used for not only data communication but also proximity sensing and is ubiquitous in wearables, smartphones, personal tags, indoor-navigation beacons, and home-automation devices. The IoT metadata can cover different levels, from the radio signal strength and the media-access controller (MAC) address to device name, indoor location, temperature, humidity, air quality, and advertising messages. These IoT data can readily augment metadata such as timestamp, GPS location, and camera settings already captured by today's cameras and saved in digital photo files. With such IoT metadata, the user will have much richer ways to understand the subject and environment of the scene being captured by the photo or media, such as the subject's fitness condition, the advertised events, and the tagged personal items at the scene. These metadata will enable new ways of searching, querying, and organizing the photos and the associated objects. Moreover, a novel mechanism we propose is the ability to pair with a remote device whose identity and routing information is captured as IoT metadata, so that an authorized user can then pair with it at a later time remotely. We contend that IoT metadata capturing can bring significant benefits to the users.

A Low Power 2.4 GHz Superheterodyne Receiver Architecture with External LO for Wirelessly Powered Backscatter Tags and Sensors	2017 IEEE INTERNATIONAL CONFERENCE ON RFID (RFID)	IEEE International Conference on RFID		English	Proceedings Paper	IEEE International Conference on RFID (RFID)	MAY 09-11, 2017	Phoenix, AZ	IEEE		Backscatter; Bluetooth Smart; Bluetooth Low Energy; BLE; FSK Receiver; Wireless; Internet of Things; RFID; Wireless Sensor Network		We present a low power superheterodyne receiver architecture for wirelessly powered backscatter tags and sensors. This receiver architecture eliminates the power hungry local oscillator (LO) from the receiver by leveraging an external continuous wave (CW) carrier as both power source and LO source. The superheterodyne intermediate frequency (IF) is obtained from the output of a custom designed passive two-port mixer which simultaneously serves as an energy harvester. We have validated the proposed architecture at 2.4 GHz in benchtop proof-of-concept testing by successfully receiving and decoding Bluetooth Low Energy (BLE) advertising packets, which use GFSK modulation at 1 Mbps.

However, navigating around public transportation for the visually impaired and physically challenged sections of society is a challenging task. With rapid proliferation of technology, there has been a pressing need to develop enhanced methodologies to help people with disabilities access public transportation. While there are many navigation systems, some of them leverage Global Positioning System (GPS) technology, which is useful in outdoor environments but is not effective in navigating indoor environments. Beacons are emergent sensors that are becoming popular for indoor positioning in malls and airports. They use Bluetooth Low Energy (BLE) technology, which is extensively supported by all modern day smartphones. In this paper, we propose a proof of concept (POC) for a mobile application which uses BLE beacons to provide assistance to people with special needs. This application would provide an easy to use voice interface for navigating inside stations, buses and trains. As a part of our research, we aim to use existing beacons on some regional transit centers and deploy new beacons. We plan to analyze VTA's (Valley Transportation Authority) ridership data to extract contextual data about the commuter's current environment inorder to provide commuter's with a cognitive solution and assistance during travel. The end goal of our research is to enhance the VTA travel experience for special need travelers in the San Francisco Bay Area.

DIORAMA disaster situation awareness and management system enhances the situation awareness of emergency responders by localizing victims in real time. In this paper we introduce a low cost localization algorithm for DIORAMA system using Bluetooth Low Energy (BLE) technology. The BLE based localization algorithm improves the localization accuracy of stationary victims as well as re-localizes moving victims opportunistically. Our localization algorithm introduces a Kurtosis-based confidence metric which is used to improve the location estimation and a Maximum Likelihood (ML)-based detector used to detect victims' movements. Our experiments show that the proposed localization algorithm can detect the movement of the victims with a false positive rate as low as 1.2% and can localize victims within an average accuracy of 11ft.

In this paper, a novel denoising autoencoder-based BLE indoor localization (DABIL) method is proposed to provide high-performance 3-D positioning in large indoor places. A deep learning model, called denoising autoencoder, is adopted to extract robust fingerprint patterns from received signal strength indicator measurements, and a fingerprint database is constructed with reference locations in 3-D space, rather than traditional 2-D plane. Field experiments show that 3-D space fingerprinting can effectively increase positioning accuracy, and DABIL performs the best in terms of both horizontal accuracy and vertical accuracy, comparing with a traditional fingerprinting method and a deep learning-based method. Moreover, it can achieve stable performance with incomplete beacon measurements due to unpredictable BLE beacon lost.

This factor is closely related to the increase of air pollution, traffic congestion and road non-safety. Due to this, the automotive industry and research entities have put lots of efforts in exploring the potential of the Intelligent Transportation Systems (ITS). These efforts have been focused on trying to add ITS systems to the new cars of the future. The present work describes a proposal for taking advantage of ITS possibilities using the vehicles that are nowadays on our roads. In particular, the described platform is mainly based on smartphones, but also on sensors and servers. The proposal is based on a hybrid scheme that combines an online mode using the Internet access of the smartphone, with an offline mode using wireless technologies such as WiFi Direct and Bluetooth Low Energy to define various ITS applications related with traffic collisions, violations, jams, signs and lights, and parking management. The described system has been developed for the Android platform, producing promising results.

The global passenger traffic is expected to grow steadily in the coming years. This growth in traffic thus calls for a corresponding increase in the comfort and service provided to passengers on-board a railway train. In this paper, we propose CARE, an Internet of Things (IoT) based system for catering to passenger services and requests in railway trains. The system leverages the use of Bluetooth Low Energy (BLE) technology to track the location of crew members (mobile resources) within a train. An On-line Proximity-Aware Mobile (OPAM) multi-objective resource allocation algorithm has been devised which on the basis of service arrival time, location information and workload factor, allocates crew members to the requests from the passengers. We have experimentally evaluated the performance of our approach and found it to be far better than the conventionally used purely centralized method. For inter train and station scenarios, a mobile agent based solution has been proposed to locate the resources not available within a train.

WiFi Fingerprinting using a mobile phone is perhaps the most widely used method. However, this is powerhungry, and its typical positioning accuracy (2.0 to 3.0 meters) is not enough to differentiate between adjacent narrow aisles to locate items. In this paper, we present a novel (Bluetooth Low Energy) BLE Received Signal Strength Indication (RSSI) ranking based fingerprinting method that uses Kendall Tau Correlation Coefficient (KTCC) to correlate a new signal position with the signal strength ranking of multiple low-power iBeacon devices situated in a retail space. This offers a higher positioning accuracy and is supported in recent smartphones. An important source of error is the RSSI, which varies depending on the model and orientation of the phone. We present a novel way to mitigate this. We validated our method in a retail-like indoor space of Queen Mary Library. We achieved an average positioning error of 0.87 meters which was sufficient to differentiate between physical space aisles.

For the IoT connected healthcare applications, the wireless body area network (WBAN) is gaining popularity as wearable devices spring into the market. This paper proposes a wearable sensor node with solar energy harvesting and Bluetooth low energy transmission that enables the implementation of an autonomous WBAN. Multiple sensor nodes can be deployed on different positions of the body to measure the subject's body temperature distribution, heartbeat, and detect falls. A web-based smartphone application is also developed for displaying the sensor data and fall notification. To extend the lifetime of the wearable sensor node, a flexible solar energy harvester with an output-based maximum power point tracking technique is used to power the sensor node. Experimental results show that the wearable sensor node works well when powered by the solar energy harvester. The autonomous 24 h operation is achieved with the experimental results. The proposed system with solar energy harvesting demonstrates that long-term continuous medical monitoring based on WBAN is possible provided that the subject stays outside for a short period of time in a day.

To compare all technologies on an equal basis, we have developed an analyzer that computes the energy consumption for a given protocol based on the power required in a given state (Sleep, Idle, Tx, and Rx) and the duration of each state. We consider the case of an energy constrained node that uploads data to a sink, analyzing the physical (PHY) layer under medium access control (MAC) constraints, and assuming IPv6 traffic whenever possible. This paper considers the energy spent in retransmissions due to corrupted frames and collisions as well as the impact of imperfect clocks. The comparison shows that the BLE offers the best lifetime for all traffic intensities in its capacity range. LoRa achieves long lifetimes behind 802.15.4 and BLE for ultra low traffic intensity; SIGFOX only matches LoRa for very small data sizes. Moreover, considering the energy consumption due to retransmissions of lost data packets only decreases the lifetimes without changing their relative ranking. We believe that these comparisons will give all users of IoT technologies indications about the technology that bestfits their needs from the energy consumption point of view. Our analyzer will also help IoT network designers to select the right MAC parameters to optimize the energy consumption for a given application.

The proposed scheme includes the topology configuration procedure, topology recovery scheme, and on-demand routing protocol. The topology configuration procedure consists of node discovery, piconet configuration, and scatternet formation in a randomly distributed environment. The proposed on-demand routing protocol is designed to minimize the number of route request messages by forwarding them to a master and relay nodes in each cluster during the route request procedure. The performance evaluation shows that our proposed scheme substantially reduces energy consumption, which is the most critical issue on energy constrained networks.

However, some systems tend to work well only in certain visually feature-rich environments. It is often the case that feature-based matching techniques can have a hard time dealing with scenes with only a few features or a large number of repetitive features. In these situations, computer vision-based localization may fail to estimate camera position or may yield a large localization error. We approach this problem from a systems perspective, where we are required to obtain accurate localization of blind travellers using a smartphones app for localization. In particular, we assume that the environment is already instrumented with Bluetooth low energy (BLE) signals to provide rough proximity information, and we propose to integrate it with visual information to perform efficient structure-from-motion and camera localization. Our multi-model sensing approach can accelerate localization speed and obtain more accuracy in challenging environments when compared to traditional baseline approaches. We also show that our approach can accelerate the time for reconstructing large 3D models. Our framework is released as an open source project. It can be used by different mobile operating systems, enabling the development of navigation applications on mobile platforms.

Design/methodology/approach - This is a conceptual discussion based on findings from a series of projects in healthcare, IT development and consultancy. The key methodologies considered include technology assessment, scenario development, listening to people with dementia and their caregivers and non-participant observation, as well as reviews of good practice, policy and literature. Findings - The transfer considerations showed unreasonable price differences of similar hardware used for localization between the logistics and the elderly market. Bluetooth low energy (BLE) was identified as a promising localization technique. A gap in the marketing of technology for the elderly was identified, virtually fencing the elderly market. Practical implications - A lack of transparency fosters market skimming, resulting in deadweight loss for society and technology being restrained from less-solvent consumers. Corrective actions like entrepreneurship facilitation and consumer education should be considered to overcome this market failure. To persevere in a consequently more competitive market, changes in marketing should be considered. Originality/value - The work assesses the presence of the innovativeness- needs paradox of Everett Rogers in the field of innovation for the elderly on the basis of an example and identifies the resulting market failure. It suggests a market-entry mode and briefly lays out the marketing modes for market penetration.

The proposed system consists of a primary and secondary sub-system which work in tandem to recognize static gestures signed by the user. Each of the sub-systems consists of a sensory glove, embedded with custom made, low-cost flex and contact sensors interfaced with a ATMega328 microcontroller. The two sub-systems are wirelessly inter-connected through a pair of TI's CC2541 Bluetooth Low Energy (BLE) modules. The system recognizes gestures with the help of a Dual-mode Intelligent Agent (DIA) which operates in Identification Mode (IM) and intelligently switches to Enhanced Identification Mode (EIM) when the gesture fails to get recognized in IM. The EIM incorporates a Bit Stream Error Elimination (BSEE) algorithm which enhances the gesture recognition accuracy without the addition of any external hardware. The performance of the system was evaluated using a data set comprising of 196 static gestures from eight globally used sign languages. The system efficiency was found to be 80.06% in IM and was enhanced to 93.16% in EIM. The cost of the proposed system in prototype stage is USD 22, which the authors believe could be realized at under USD 10 on commercialization.

Bluetooth is a widely spread wireless connection protocol that is called upon to meet such demands. It operates in the internationally allocated, unlicensed Industrial, Scientific, & Medical (ISM) frequency spectrum. Bluetooth Low Energy (BLE), as a connectivity solution with high demands for power conservation accompanied with size limitation, can meet these demands. However, the lack of proven field data for BLE can be the root of uncertainties related to perceived quality of the interface. The main function of BLE in the H.A industry is to provide an audio and/or control interface between the Hearing aid and an external device. This function is investigated in this study. The mentioned function can be divided into 3 different operational modes; (I) pairing, (II) audio streaming and (III) control application. Some of the operational modes can potentially fail, while at the same time the rest remain operational. Since BLE has the aforementioned multistate functionality, the Markov process can be used to provide a practical approach for BLE functionality modeling. The method followed here is to group failure modes according to their severity ranks in the Failure Mode and Effect Analysis (FMEA) table. Accordingly, the transition from initial state means transitioning to higher severity in FMEA. Thereafter, the state transition rates can be obtained from the occurrence likelihood of the failure causes and their related detection likelihood. It is henceforth straightforward to solve the Markov chain by establishing the states matrix, the time dependent equations and steady state probabilities.

However, with the development of IoT, The disadvantage of BLE is becoming more obvious. Due to only three channel is used for BLE broadcasting, the signal collision would become very serious when a large number of BLE devices is existing in a narrow area. This leads to a low scanning performance. According to adjust the parameters (advertisement interval and scan interval), the effect of collision on scanning performance could be mitigated. However, how to adjust these parameters is an issue. In order to make the analysis of scanning performance simple, we developed a simulator in this paper. At last, we will compare the simulation results with experiment. The comparison results shows the validity of our simulator.

However, the Bluetooth range is limited, and a user typically cannot communicate with home Bluetooth devices from outside the home. A technology is therefore proposed that identifies Bluetooth devices in the home and connects with the devices without a communication range limitation. The proposed method is extended to support Bluetooth Low Energy (BLE). A prototype of the extended system was implemented. Based on an experimental evaluation of the prototype system, we confirmed that the proposed technology enables a user to identify remotely located BLE devices through the Internet within an allowable communication delay range.

It is known that many elderly people prefer to stay in their homes for as long as possible and remote monitoring can be a solution, but often such systems lack useful information or are prohibitive due to cost, ease of use/deployment and wireless coverage. This work presents a novel gateway software architecture based on threads being managed by dictionary memory. The architecture has been deployed in a distributed interconnected set of low-cost consumer grade gateway devices using Bluetooth Low Energy (BLE) that are positioned around the home. The gateway devices can then be used to listen, monitor or connect to BLE based healthcare sensors to continually reveal information about the user with full residential coverage. A further novelty of this work is the ability to maintain handover connections between many sensors and many gateways as a user moves throughout their home, thus the gateways can route information to/from sensors across the consumer's home network. The system has been tested in an experimental house and is now poised to be initially deployed to 100 homes for residential healthcare monitoring before any public mass consumer deployment.

Questionnaires and direct observations have often been used as mechanisms to identify office based interactions, however, these are either very time consuming, yield coarse grained information or do not scale to large numbers of people. Technology has been recently employed to cut costs and improve output, however precise interaction dynamics gathering often requires individuals to wear custom hardware. In this paper, we present an extensive evaluation of Bluetooth Low Energy (BLE) as a technology to monitor people proximity in the workplace. We examine the key parameters that affect the accuracy of the detected contacts and their impact on power consumption. We study how this system can be implemented on popular wearable devices (i.e., Android Wear and Tizen) and the resulting limitations. Through a real world deployment in a commercial organisation with 25 participants we evaluate the performances of a BLE-based proximity detection technique. Our results show the suitability of BLE for workplace interaction detection and give guidance to vendors and Operating System (OS) developers on the impact of the restrictions regarding the use of BLE on commodity wearables.

One of the main reasons is that a campus' local network is uncovered by public search engines, and most of the local Web sites in a community operate like information silos. A secondary reason is that the daily activities in a local community are highly dynamic; people might be annoyed by the non-correlated information or they just ignore all of it, regardless of importance. In this paper, the proposed campus digital signage aims at connecting local users to correlated information as the user passes by. To this end, we build the server side with two components; one is the information collector that will automatically pull the campus information from other sites, and the other is the information poster to allow qualified users to post content. We also design a wearable client side with a BLE (Bluetooth low energy) proximity sensor to recognize approaching user's identity and dynamically push their correlated information to the digital signage display.

Bluetooth Low Energy (BLE) extends the capabilities of smartphones even further and thus provides the potential for retailers to offer services to customers based on their location that is challenging with conventional techniques. Before embarking on developing solutions, it is vital to understand the factors that influence consumers to embrace this technology and ensure retailers can offer appropriate services to their customers. While a number of studies have discussed BLE, very little have examined it from the consumers' perspective. This study extends the UTAUT2 model with 'privacy concern' and explores the factors influencing consumers' behaviour towards proximity sensors within a retail store. The results confirm that all the factors except for 'price value' are statistically significant.

Increasing tour efficiency while minimizing resources required has been studied by many researchers. The traditional multilingual human tour guides limit in the fact that, they cannot provide personalized information to every visitor because of time constraint. Also, having persons to assist tourists as a guide is expensive. Some tour guide robots and devices were presented in previous works to overcome certain limitations, but some challenges still exist. In this work, an indoor location-aware portable device is presented aiming at improving the user's experience during a tour of an indoor facility. The proposed system can provide personalized audio-visual information based on the location of the visitor, making the visitors independent of following a guide. The core of the module is a Raspberry Pi 3 with Bluetooth Low Energy (BLE) and Wi-Fi transceivers. Localization is performed using iBeacons, and RFID technology is used to identify certain objects. The Thingworx platform has been used as the application cloud server while YouTube has been used to present visual feedback to the user.

These sensors, with small form factor and low cost, present an advantage for computing three-dimensional space object orientation. Also radio frequency communication (RF) devices are frequently associated with inertial sensors and embedded systems. Radio frequency communication protocols allow immediate data transfer and processing without cumbersome cabling. With special relevance for sports monitoring, gait analysis and general movement assessment inertial sensors have been embedded together to form one device with several sensors. The so called Inertial Measurement Units (IMU), that include an accelerometer, a gyroscope and sometimes may include one magnetometer, are increasingly used, despite their inherent inaccuracy, to determine a body orientation and/or movement profile. These sensors present therefore an advantage for computing three-dimensional space object orientation. The inherent inaccuracy is addressed by using sensor fusion algorithms that increase system reliability. In the work presented in [1], a survey of a number of relevant sensor fusion algorithms was presented. In [2] a Yaskawa Motoman robotic arm is used to implement a set of predefined movements that granted accuracy and repeatability conditions to a framework that is able to test systems that are able to determine a body position. In both [1] and [2], a Bluetooth Low Energy based CC2541 Texas Instruments device has been used to transfer the required data from the IMU sensors to a PC computer running a Windows operating system. This paper presents the BLE proprietary profile that has been implemented to transfer data in wireless mode. Moreover, the paper describes the BLE protocol basics and the relevant options so that implemented systems are low power and fully compatible with the protocol. Also the future use of the developed device is addressed within the context of the Parkinson disease early diagnosis and Canoeing sport monitoring.	[Amaro, J.

Energy saving is one of the promises of Smart Buildings. This can be achieved by controlling the HVAC system, lights, and other energy consuming appliances in relation to the activities of people in the building. In particular, presence is an important factor to consider. By using beacons such as those based on Bluetooth Low Energy (BLE) and mobile phones, one can deduct occupancy information by interacting, over WiFi, with a central server. In the present study, we investigate BLE utilization for transmitting the occupancy data to the server using off-the-self devices with several parameters, e.g., distance, packet size, and line-of-sight state. Furthermore, we propose a utilization of size-constrained BLE packets for transmitting occupancy data, which was previously only possible by means of HTTP over WiFi. The result shows that it is possible to transmit occupancy data via BLE, despite of its resource constraints. Bluetooth is also shown to be about 30% more energy efficient than WiFi to perform occupancy data transmission, i.e., the mobile phone has 16 hours and 38 minutes of battery life when running on BLE communication scheme and 14 hours and 46 minutes in WiFi communication.

The proposed PHY, which is referred to as Narrow-band WiFi (NB-WiFi) can be supported by an OFDM transceiver available in an IEEE 802.11 access point (AP). In addition, NB-WiFi supports concurrent use of low data rate IoT application and high data rate broadband using IEEE 802.11ax technology, based on a single IFFT/FFT in the AP. In the sensor node, Bluetooth Low Energy (BLE) hardware can be reused, making it suitable for dual mode implementation of BLE and NB-WiFi. The performance of the proposed PHY is simulated for an AWGN channel, and it achieves about 10 dB improved sensitivity compared to a typical BLE receiver, due to the lower data rate.

In this work, IEEE 802.15.4 and Bluetooth Low Energy (BLE) protocols are evaluated with respect to service ratio, delay, and energy efficiency under IPv6 traffic. While the performance is terms of delay is similar between the two technologies, BLE outperforms 802.15.4 in terms of service ratio and energy efficiency. Header compression increases all performance indicators but requires a shared context to be set up and managed. IPv6 multicast is also investigated in combination with data link layer broadcast and sequential unicast. Finally, the impact of IPv6 connection establishment and maintenance is evaluated. This is particularly relevant for BLE devices using privacy features. It is shown that the procedures for registering IPv6 addresses and updating contexts affect the delay significantly, but only at very low traffic intensity.

AirChat: Ad Hoc Network Monitoring with Drones	2017 SYSTEMS AND INFORMATION ENGINEERING DESIGN SYMPOSIUM (SIEDS)			English	Proceedings Paper	Systems and Information Engineering Design Symposium (SIEDS)	APR 28, 2017	Charlottesville, VA			FireChat; Mesh Network; WiFi Pineapple		FireChat is a mobile messaging application that uses a mesh network topology to communicate between users through a cellular, WiFi, or Bluetooth Low Energy connection. FireChat has seen global growth for use in crowded events such as protests. The team has worked in conjunction with the MITRE Corporation to develop a system that attaches to a quadrotor and monitors nearby connections to gather metadata on the FireChat. This information is analyzed to provide insight into the structure of large groups or specific devices using FireChat. The WiFi Pineapple Nano, Ubertooth One, and HackRF One were tested for monitoring FireChat. From these three, the Pineapple was selected to monitor WiFi and the Ubertooth was chosen to monitor Bluetooth. The devices were evaluated based upon their ability to provide useful data, meet size, weight, and power requirements, and function across all platforms on which FireChat can be installed. While the Ubertooth provided some relevant data about the use of FireChat, it was inconsistent so Bluetooth development was discontinued. The Pineapple, however, successfully collects the MAC address and connected routers of the FireChat devices. A Raspberry Pi runs scripts to control the Pineapple to scan WiFi networks and collect FireChat data. Further, the time and location will be saved based on timing of received data and location of the quadrotor.

While current home automation systems provide localization at a GPS level, they do not identify users' locations within a building. The smart home technology market is growing rapidly and this feature can differentiate a product line by adding unique capabilities for the consumer. The objective for this system is to use individualized location determination to improve lifestyle areas in the home in passive and non-intrusive ways. Being passive is important in that users should not have to take extra steps (e.g., pushing a button when they enter a room) as they move throughout their house. Being non-intrusive is important because users should not have to wear anything extra (e.g., a special armband) or have personal information scanned (e.g., facial recognition camera). The system will use Bluetooth Low Energy (BLE) to identify and track users' movements throughout a house, where the BLE signal of an individual will be associated with a smartphone or fitness wearable that they normally carry with them. A unique aspect of this project is the implementation of a flipped BLE architecture, which is implemented with a Texas Instruments development board that acts as a beacon to identify users based on their BLE signals from their smartphones and wearables. This architecture is "flipped" because most BLE beacons rely on a smartphone to "see" the beacons whereas the beacons in this system are "seeing" the smartphones. After identifying BLE devices in proximity to the beacon, the prototype system will record readings on the beacon locally, store data in an SQL database, and clean and process data through a PHP script. Different use cases for the BLE system within a house were considered. The final prototype will focus on a Smart Thermostat application which automatically adjusts where a thermostat reads the indoor temperature based on the location of the users. Results include a fully functioning prototype that can be used to demonstrate feasibility of the home automation use cases. Test results from the prototype include using a factorial experiment to measure the effect of distance and obstacles on the signal strength readings as well as performance on the system through a range of scenarios.

The system permits the co-location and simultaneous operation of a commercial Bluetooth chipset with a carrier source, enabling the use of specially designed BLE-Backscatter tags to send data to the commercial Bluetooth chipset with no software modifications. This demonstration shows the potential for reusing the wireless chipsets in future full-duplex devices as readers for backscatter tags and other backscatter-based devices. Using a directional coupler-based carrier cancellation implementation, we achieve carrier suppression of 50 dB. In an over-the-air experiment using a dipole antenna with 2.1 dBi gain, we observe a read range of 3 meters with an 88% packet success rate at a carrier power of +33.9 dBm.

For addressing this issue, this paper propose a new broadcast mechanism under the assumption of the next generation technology of Bluetooth Low Energy, using Nack mechanism combined with energy detection mechanism, in order to support seamless broadcast transmission of audio data stream. For further study, this paper designed energy detection for Nack reception without awareness of the number of slave nodes.

We have studied a novel approach to finding lost objects using active RFID. We hypothesize that users can deduce the location of a lost object from information about surrounding objects in an environment where RFID tags are attached to all personal belongings. To help find lost objects fromthe proximity between RFID tags, the system calculates the proximity between pairs of RFID tags from the RSSI series and estimates the groups of objects in the neighborhood. We developed a method for calculating the proximity of the lost object to those around it using a distance function between RSSI series and estimating the group by hierarchical clustering. There is no method to evaluate whether a combination is suitable for application purposes directly. Presently, different combinations of distance functions and clustering algorithms yield different clustering results. Thus, we propose the number of nearest neighbor candidates (NNNC) as the criterion to evaluate the clustering results. The simulation results show that the NNNC is an appropriate evaluation criterion for our system because it is able to exhaustively evaluate the combination of distance functions and clustering algorithms.

Operators and building administrators are interested in locating unknown Txs for optimizing new Tx placement, detecting and removing unauthorized Txs, selecting the nearest Tx to offload traffic onto it, and constructing radio maps for indoor and outdoor navigation. This survey provides a comprehensive review of existing algorithms that estimate the location of a wireless Tx given a set of observations with the received signal strength indication. Algorithms that require the observations to be location-tagged are suitable for outdoor mapping or small-scale indoor mapping, while algorithms that allow most observations to be unlocated trade off some accuracy to enable large-scale crowdsourcing. This article presents empirical evaluation of the algorithms using numerical simulations and real-world Bluetooth Low Energy data.

J	Lee, CH				Lee, Chang Ha			Location-Aware Speakers for the Virtual Reality Environments	IEEE ACCESS			English	Article						3D audio rendering; surround sound; indoor localization; received signal strength indication; internet of things; bluetooth low energy		This paper presents location-aware speakers for the immersive virtual reality environments as well as conventional surround sound systems. The surround sound system generally requires multiple speakers fixed in specific positions and connected to dedicated audio jack holes. In this paper, we propose wireless speakers that can aware their locations and dedicated sound channels without troublesome installations. The proposed speakers use the Internet of things devices by combining a Raspberry Pi and a beacon to each speaker, which enable smart and connected applications. Each speaker estimates distances to other speakers from received signal strength indication of beacons with bluetooth low energy signals. By analyzing the relative distances between speakers, we detect the speaker locations in various speaker setups. We experimented our method with three sound system formats in various sizes and analyzed the accuracy of the location detection.

J	Contreras, D; Castro, M; de la Torre, DS				Contreras, David; Castro, Mario; Sanchez de la Torre, David			Performance evaluation of bluetooth low energy in indoor positioning systems	TRANSACTIONS ON EMERGING TELECOMMUNICATIONS TECHNOLOGIES			English	Article							NETWORK	Local positioning systems (LPS) are attracting much attention, both commercially and scientifically, as they represent a natural extension of global positioning systems to indoor scenarios. Amongst all the viable wireless technologies used in this context, WiFi and Bluetooth are the most widely extended. These technologies are also chosen for their simplicity, low cost and integration into mobile devices. The appearance of the new Bluetooth specification, named Bluetooth low energy (BLE), and the emergence of new popular devices that incorporate it, opens the door to new LPS wireless solutions based on BLE. Here, we evaluate the viability of BLE for indoor positioning scenarios. In addition, we develop a framework to analyse, understand and help migrate previous LPS systems, based on other technologies, to BLE. We show experimentally that, with proper configuration of the BLE devices, great performance can be obtained in terms of discovery time and energy consumption.

To keep the performance of the first operating frequency 2.4GHz (for Bluetooth Low Energy (BLE)) and generate the second operating frequency 5.9GHz (for Dedicated Short Range Communications (DSRC)) simultaneously, complementary triangular split resonant rings (CTSRRs) and splitting gaps are employed to improve the performance of this new coupler; final size of the proposed coupler is 0.24 lambda(g) (for 2.4GHz). To validate the performance and design method of the coupler this paper proposed, a 3D model is constructed and optimized with ANSOFT HFSS firstly and then a coupler prototype is fabricated and measured. The measured results show that the amplitude unbalance (AU) is 0.54 dB and 0.44 dB for 2.4GHz and 5.9GHz, respectively, and the corresponding phase unbalance (PU) is 93.5 and 92 degrees, respectively.

This fact can be leveraged to carry out opportunistic sensor data collection (OSDC) in scenarios where a sensor node cannot communicate with infrastructure nodes. In such cases, a mobile entity (e.g., a pedestrian or a vehicle) equipped with a BLE-enabled device can collect the data obtained by the sensor node when both are within direct communication range. In this paper, we characterize, both analytically and experimentally, the performance and trade-offs of BLE as a technology for OSDC, for the two main identified approaches, and considering the impact of its most crucial configuration parameters. Results show that a BLE sensor node running on a coin cell battery can achieve a lifetime beyond one year while transferring around 10 Mbit/day, in realistic OSDC scenarios.

The driver's stress is estimated by the use of physiological signals and steering wheel motion analysis. The steering wheel motion is analyzed by driver's hand moving characteristic. Principally, the sensors on the glove gathered the photoplethysmogram signal via fingertip, and hand motion signal via inertial motion unit. The sensor module readings are transmitted to an end terminal application via a Bluetooth low energy transmission module to compute the driver stress index. The studies are carried out in a simulated driving, which is composed of three distinct driving scenarios to study the subjects' behaviors that correlate with stress. Twenty-eight subjects are requested to perform three different driving sessions with random scenarios generated while performing various driving maneuvers to assess the dynamic of mental workloads. The stress assessments of driving test subjects are self-reported at pre- and post-stimulus as well as observed through facial expression recorded throughout the whole experiments. Moreover, this paper also aimed to investigate the correlation of stress events with different driving tasks. Stress index is computed by a support vector machine pattern classifier with extracted features from sensors reading. Notably, stress index differences were found among three driving scenarios and driving maneuvers. Results revealed the true accuracy of stress detection is greater than 95% in average.

J	Marincic, A; Simunic, D; Prasad, R				Marincic, Antonija; Simunic, Dina; Prasad, Ramjee			Challenges of eWALL Wireless Interoperability	WIRELESS PERSONAL COMMUNICATIONS			English	Article						Wireless interoperability; eWALL; Wireless sensor networks; WPAN technologies; Interference; Cognitive radio; SEAMCAT	SENSOR NETWORKS; HOME; TECHNOLOGIES; PROTOCOL	Due to development of different technologies there has been significant improvement in quality of life. As a result of that, average person's lifetime duration has been increased. That triggers the problem of independent living of senior citizens. One of the main concerns of the world today is how to enable senior citizens to live independently. As a response to that, systems like eWALL are being developed. eWALL for Active Long Living is a FP7 funded project and it aims to develop system which will enable elderly people to live independently. These systems consist of a large number of sensors which make wireless sensor network. In this paper, different wireless technologies that can be used for communication in systems that are designed to support independent living of elderly people, have been described. The most important focus is at wireless personal area network technologies, like ZigBee, Bluetooth, Bluetooth Low Energy and wireless local area network technologies (e.g., Wi-Fi). There are many obstacles in designing wireless sensor network and most of them concern energy efficiency and interoperability of different technologies that are being used for communication. The main challenge in the current technology world is tremendous increase of use of various wireless devices and technologies, which can cause relatively high interference, so that the wireless devices can stop working. Using cognitive radio in solving the interoperability problem of different wireless technologies in wireless sensor networks has become interesting research topic. In this paper, research on interoperability of different wireless technologies is presented. Using Spectrum Engineering Advanced Monte Carlo Analysis Tool wireless sensors network in home environment was modelled. Interference based on devices layout and activity was investigated. Also, possible improvements that can be made with cognitive radio are investigated and obtained results are given in this paper.

In our previous work, we proposed an ADLs recognition system based on non-intrusive environment sensing for people in One person Household (OPH). However, the proposed recognition system did not perform well, the micro-averaged and macro-averaged precision of most of the recognition models was only around 60%. In order to improve the quality of the system, in this article, we propose a new ADLs recognition system by integrating environment sensing and Bluetooth Low Energy (BLE) beacon technology and evaluate the new version of the ADLs recognition model by comparing the experimental data collected from a real resident in OPH.

Cardiac monitoring and screening technologies like Electrocardiography (ECG) need to be moved out from within the confines of hospital walls to places within easy reach of the wider mass of the countrys population; through remote deployment in primary care centers and homes. Affordability, accuracy and deep penetration are key to the success of any envisaged solution. The accuracy of reports generated by a remotely deployed ECG monitor primarily depend on the accuracy of the actual hardware making the measurement, and can be guaranteed by choosing any of the time tested bio-potential measurement ICs. The penetration however depends on the technology deployed for remote access of the ECG device. This technology must have the potential to be easily integrated into the minimal networking infrastructure existing in the rural areas and hinterlands of the country. A combination of Bluetooth Low Energy (BLE) and cellular networks, utilizing a smartphone, supporting minimum features, as a common access point is a promising solution for remotely accessing an ECG monitor deployed in rural areas. The challenge however is in developing methods to reliably transmit ECG data over both the BLE link and cellular networks meeting all the QoS requirements of medical standard ECG monitoring application. In this paper we first list out a set of QoS requirements for ECG monitoring application, drawn from discussions with cardiologists and from studying existing literature. We then explore the feasibility of a BLE link meeting these requirements, with supporting results from tests performed with a prototype which we developed.

Establishing cryptographically secure communication links between two transceivers requires the pre-agreement on some key, unknown to an external attacker. In recent years there has been growing attention in techniques that generate a shared random key through observation of the channel and its effects on the exchanged messages. In this work we present SKYGlow, a novel scheme for secret-key generation, designed for IoT devices, such as IEEE 802.15.4 and Bluetooth Low Energy (BLE) transceivers. SKYGlow employs the Discreet Cosine Transform (DCT) of channel observations and Slepian-Wolf coding for information reconciliation. Real-life experiments have resulted in the creation of 128-bit secret keys with only 65 packet exchanges and with an entropy of 0.9978 bits, making our scheme much more energy-efficient compared with others in the existing literature.

We have developed both a special box using an Arduino board, and a mobile application on Android to determine the location of the target based on the Bluetooth Low Energy signals transmitted by special Beacons which are placed in the area of interest. Both systems are used to determine the position of the person and to monitor any event that would cause an alert. Those events can be a long stay in a fixed position, or the entry into pre-defined forbidden zones. The location data will be stored in a database for further processing. Alerts can trigger messages to be sent to local authorities and/or relatives of the people. Measurements and test results are discussed regarding their performance. It is clear that more research and development is necessary for obtaining reliable products.

These systems, however, are not usable indoors, because there is no signal from satellites. Therefore, it is necessary to use other localization techniques indoors. This paper focuses on the use of Bluetooth Low Energy and Wi-Fi radio technologies. We have created a special mobile application for the Android operating system in order to evaluate these techniques. This application allows localization testing in a real environment within a building of a university campus. We compare multiple approaches based on K-Nearest Neighbors and Particle Filter algorithms that have been further modified. The combination of Low Energy Bluetooth and Wi-Fi appears to be a promising solution reaching the satisfying accuracy and minimal deployment costs.

A proposed quadrature LO buffer employs the transconductor-type IQ quadrature generator with a gain/phase mismatch compensator and generates accurate quadrature signals at the 2.4 GHz frequency with parasitic capacitances. The proposed LO buffer can minimize the power consumption of the LO path because the block generating quadrature signals such as a divider-by-2, a poly-phase filter, and a quadrature VCO can be removed from the LO path.

Besides, the patients who come to the emergency department at first time have a confusion of geographical direction. To overcome this issue, we implemented an indoor navigation system by using the Bluetooth low energy (BLE) technology and smartphone. The system has three major features, such as indoor location, indoor navigation, and physician-patient communication. The experimental results revealed that the proposed localization algorithm achieved 1.48-meter average error. By the proposed indoor navigation system, the problem of getting lost in the emergency department could be alleviated. Besides, the individual communication platform provides the patients and medical practitioners have convenient and private communication channels.

J	Tran, TV; Chung, WY				Thang Viet Tran; Chung, Wan-Young			High-Efficient Energy Harvester With Flexible Solar Panel for a Wearable Sensor Device	IEEE SENSORS JOURNAL			English	Article						Energy harvesting; flexible solar panel; maximum power point tracker (MPPT); wearable devices	PHOTOVOLTAIC SYSTEMS; NODES	This paper proposes an optimal energy harvester (OEH) that uses a flexible photovoltaic (FPV) module to prolong battery life for a wearable body sensor node under indoor and outdoor conditions. The proposed sensor node uses a Bluetooth low- energy module, which consumes low power to wirelessly communicate with mobile devices for monitoring vital signals. A 19 cm x 4 cm FPV module that can easily conform to human body contours is used for generating a peak- power of up to 500 mW to charge the battery in outdoor environments. To optimize the power collected under various irradiances, the OEH is designed with a boost circuit for harvesting the low energy available indoors and a maximum power point tracker for collecting the high energy that is available outdoors. The booster can operate within a wide input voltage range of 0.65- 3 V to generate a stable output voltage of 3.3 V, and it has a high conversion efficiency of similar to 95%. The MPPT uses fuzzy inference engine to find the MPP of the FPV that is required to power the system. The results of our experiment show that the proposed device can prolong the lifetime by up to 950% under an irradiance of only 2.9 mW/cm(2), and the proposed node becomes an autonomous node under partial shading and sunlight conditions. Therefore, this paper can provide a useful solution for extending the lifetime of wearable sensor devices.

However, typical gait analysis has to be performed in a gait laboratory, which is inaccessible for a large population and cannot provide natural gait measures. In this paper, we present a novel sensor device, namely, Smart Insole, to tackle the challenge of efficient gait monitoring in real life. An array of electronic textile (eTextile)-based pressure sensors are integrated in the insole to fully measure the plantar pressure. Smart Insole is also equipped with a low-cost inertial measurement unit including a three-axis accelerometer, a three-axis gyroscope, and a three-axis magnetometer to capture the gait characteristics in motion. Smart Insole can offer precise acquisition of gait information. Meanwhile, it is lightweight, thin, and comfortable to wear, providing an unobtrusive way to perform the gait monitoring. Furthermore, a smartphone graphic user interface is developed to display the sensor data in real-time via Bluetooth low energy. We perform a set of experiments in four real-life scenes including hallway walking, ascending/descending stairs, and slope walking, where gait parameters and features are extracted. Finally, the limitation and improvement, wearability and usability, further work, and healthcare-related potential applications are discussed.

J	Rachim, VP; Chung, WY				Rachim, Vega Pradana; Chung, Wan-Young			Wearable Noncontact Armband for Mobile ECG Monitoring System	IEEE TRANSACTIONS ON BIOMEDICAL CIRCUITS AND SYSTEMS			English	Article						Armband; bluetooth low energy; capacitive-coupled; ECG monitoring; wearable device	ELECTROCARDIOGRAM; CLOUD; CHAIR	One of the best ways to obtain health information is from an electrocardiogram (ECG). Through an ECG, characteristics such as patients' heartbeats, heart conditions, and heart disease can be analyzed. Unfortunately, most available healthcare devices do not provide clinical data such as information regarding patients' heart activities. Many researchers have tried to solve this problem by inventing wearable heart monitoring systems with a chest strap or wristband, but their performances were not feasible for practical applications. Thus, the aim of this study is to build a new system to monitor heart activity through ECG signals. The proposed system consists of capacitive-coupled electrodes embedded in an armband. It is considered to be a reliable, robust, and low-power-transmission ECG monitoring system. The reliability of this system was achieved by the careful placement of sensors in the armband. Bluetooth low energy (BLE) was used as the protocol for data transmission; this protocol was proposed to develop the low-power-transmission system. For robustness, the proposed system is equippedwith analysis capabilities-e.g., real-time heartbeat detection and a filter algorithm to ignore distractions from body movements or noise from the environment.

To alleviate some of this contention, we present opportunistic listening, an extension to BLE active mode targeting IoT deployments with large numbers of tags and small numbers of scanning devices.

The hybrid-loop structure based on an all-digital phase-locked loop enables the RX to both enhance the interference tolerance and digitize the frequency-modulated signal without an ADC. A novel single channel receiving method, which enables the conversion of the constellation from frequency shift keying to differential binary phase shift keying signal, is adopted to eliminate the Q-channel signal processing to reduce the power consumption. The prototype RX fabricated in a 65 nm CMOS technology consumes only 5.5 mW and fulfills the BLE requirements of the adjacent channel rejection and out-of-band blocker tolerance without exception. The sensitivity level is -90 dBm.

The objective of the simulations is to analyze the system-level performance with considering circuit-level specifications by integrating the necessary circuit-level measurements (or Spice simulation) into the system-level models. Bluetooth Low Energy (BLE) RF Transceiver is chosen for this study. It is modelled with SystemC-AMS (SCAMS) and is integrated into a SystemC-TLM (SCTLM) described digital BLE environment to achieve a global system simulation. The simulation gives results as the RF Transceiver energy consumption and Bit-Error-Rate (BER), which can be used to analyze and optimize RF system design.

However, the design of such systems still poses challenges, including restricted physical size, limited computational resources, and the availability of constrained energy sources. In this paper, we present a practical design space exploration of a body-worn system for prosthetic hand control based on surface electromyography (sEMG) signals. The sEMG method is a well-established sensing technology that provides the detection of electrical activity produced by the physiological contractions of muscles. The presented wearable system is designed to acquire sEMG signals for successive recognition of the performed motion and the control of the prosthetic hand, allowing to regain a considerable amount of life quality for a broad patient community. The main guiding requirements for the presented wearable system include real-time data acquisition from up to 32 sEMG channels, reliable wireless data streaming, long mobile autonomy (several days lifetime), non-intrusive mounting, and compact size. We present the system's hardware and software architecture focusing on the comparison of various communication design options such as recent Bluetooth low energy and low-power WiFi technologies.

J	Semwal, T; Nair, SB				Semwal, Tushar; Nair, Shivashankar Bhaskaran			AgPi: Agents on Raspberry Pi	ELECTRONICS			English	Article						Multi-Agent Systems; Cyber Physical Systems; Mobile Agents; Raspberry Pi; Internet of Things (IoT); BLE (Bluetooth Low Energy); Fog Computing	MOBILE AGENTS; NETWORK; TECHNOLOGY; INTERNET; SYSTEMS; THINGS; PROLOG; IOT	The Raspberry Pi and its variants have brought with them an aura of change in the world of embedded systems. With their impressive computation and communication capabilities and low footprint, these devices have thrown open the possibility of realizing a network of things in a very cost-effective manner. While such networks offer good solutions to prominent issues, they are indeed a long way from being smart or intelligent. Most of the currently available implementations of such a network of devices involve a centralized cloud-based server that contributes to making the necessary intelligent decisions, leaving these devices fairly underutilized. Though this paradigm provides for an easy and rapid solution, they have limited scalability, are less robust and at times prove to be expensive. In this paper, we introduce the concept of Agents on Raspberry Pi (AgPi) as a cyber solution to enhance the smartness and flexibility of such embedded networks of physical devices in a decentralized manner. The use of a Multi-Agent System (MAS) running on Raspberry Pis aids agents, both static and mobile, to govern the various activities within the network. Agents can act autonomously or on behalf of a human user and can collaborate, learn, adapt and act, thus contributing to embedded intelligence. This paper describes how Tartarus, a multi-agent platform, embedded on Raspberry Pis that constitute a network, can bring the best out of the system. To reveal the versatility of the concept of AgPi, an application for a Location-Aware and Tracking Service (LATS) is presented. The results obtained from a comparison of data transfer cost between the conventional cloud-based approach with AgPi have also been included.

Understanding of motion and spatiotemporal distribution of debris entrained by a flood is thus of great importance to hydraulic, coastal, and structural engineers; the displacement of debris to a location where it may eventually impact critical infrastructure requires scientific attention at the laboratory scale first. In this context, the design and application of a novel smart debris system utilizing off-the-shelf components is presented and discussed. The system tracks the spatial location and orientation of a multitude of debris specimens and it proposes an accurate tool to assess their individual trajectory, velocity, and momentum in a laboratory environment. Contrary to the traditional camera-based approach of video tracking, which often fails once objects are submerged, the proposed smart debris system delivers six-degree-of-freedom (6DOF) data in a reliable, timely manner. Miniaturized inertial measurement units (IMU), commonly called motion sensors, which are used for attitude heading reference systems are deployed to output time series of spatial orientation along with filtered 3D acceleration readings. A Bluetooth low-energy (BLE) tracking system is applied along with the motion sensor to track the 3D debris positions. A detailed investigation in controlled laboratory conditions reveals the detailed individual performance of the tested spatial orientations and positions. As an application, debris transport tests were conducted in a newly built tsunami wave basin at Waseda University in Tokyo, Japan. For this test series, a typical harbor layout with a vertical quay wall adjacent to a horizontal container-stacking platform was constructed. The advection by a broken tsunamilike bore of multiple down-scaled shipping containers in basic arrangements was then tracked from their initial position. The performance of the innovative smart debris system is qualitatively tested in order to provide guidance for their future application in hydraulic and coastal engineering as well as to provide a solid basis for its application in field studies.

The proposal includes a centralized system to forecast available indoor parking spaces, and a low-cost mobile application to obtain data of actual and predicted parking occupancy. The described scheme uses data from both sources bidirectionally so that the centralized forecast system is fed with data obtained with the distributed system based on smartphones, and vice versa. The mobile application uses different wireless technologies to provide the forecast system with actual parking data and receive from the system useful recommendations about where to park. Thus, the proposal can be used by any driver to easily find available parking spaces in indoor facilities. The client software developed for smartphones is a lightweight Android application that supplies precise indoor positioning systems based on Quick Response codes or Near Field Communication tags, and semi-precise indoor positioning systems based on Bluetooth Low Energy beacons. The performance of the proposed approach has been evaluated by conducting computer simulations and real experimentation with a preliminary implementation. The results have shown the strengths of the proposal in the reduction of the time and energy costs to find available parking spaces.

The RTL system can monitor the location and movement of multiple laborers in real time. A portable RTL system with a low-battery mode was developed to accommodate various constraints in the construction site. A conventional RTL system that uses radio signal strength indicators (RSSIs) has high error, so an accelerometer with Bluetooth Low Energy (BLE) was added, and a calculation process is suggested. Field tests were performed for validation in underground construction and bridge overlay sites. The results show that the accelerometer and BLE can be used as effective sensors to detect the movement of laborers.

Thus, in general, based on the IP address to access the service uses the IP-based filtering techniques that limit the delivery of the service. We offer a novel location based authentication method by convenient and correct way to take advantage of the Bluetooth BLE Beacon technology using smart mobile devices or laptop devices. In this research, digital content manager initiates and broadcasts BLE beacon signal for checking the presence of users near a specified area/location. We make use of the BLE Sensor Tag device as the location identification method. In this work, a publisher wants to identify whether a user is from a certain institution subscribed as site license for a period of time or not. Until now, the publisher depends on only IP filtering technique to discriminate users. The IP filtering technique allows the publisher to exclude certain IP ranges from accessing the content. So, the publisher wants to leverage users or readers to pay for accessing a technical paper by credit card. In this research, a token is HMACSHA1 generated by a Beacon based on UUID and Time. The MAC is provided only to a person who is closed to a specified location. If a member has the token, our system will connect and report to the server that the users/students are attended the class or near the manager. If the member does not have the token, our system will report to the server that the users/students are not attended the class or not near the manager. By this way a publisher can easily check the readers/users has the right to access the contents. (C) 2016 Published by Elsevier B.V.

The sensor networks shall act as early warning systems for the set-in of initiating damage processes or if, e. g., moisture penetrates a structural element or any massive structure (embankments, dykes, dams) that allow for adverse and damaging substances penetrating structural elements. During first feasibility tests we applied commercially available multifunctional sensors like a Bluetooth Low Energy (BLE) Module for investigation of the influence of moisture in a certain volume of building material on the received signal. The investigated parameters were the so-called Received Signal Strength Indicator (RSSI) of a Bluetooth Low Energy (BLE) Signal and the transmission power emitted by an embedded BLE-Module. The BLE-Module communicates with a mobile smart receiver as a tablet or a smartphone as s. c. SmartHub. The change of the RSS-Indicator is a measure for the damping as a result of changing moisture content in a structural element while the transmission power remains constant. While the BLE-Signal transfers a moist section in any material, eg. building material, the RSS-Indicator changes. After a successful feasibility study, a ZIM-project was confirmed, which was composed within the in the German Network MI4G (Modern Industry for Germany) between the Federal Institute for Materials Research and Testing (BAM) with the small enterprise LinTech GmbH, Berlin. The report presents first results and gives an outlook on further research activities.

J	Park, H; Noh, J; Cho, S				Park, Hyunwook; Noh, Jaewon; Cho, Sunghyun			Three-dimensional positioning system using Bluetooth low-energy beacons	INTERNATIONAL JOURNAL OF DISTRIBUTED SENSOR NETWORKS			English	Article						Three-dimensional network; positioning system; triangulation; Bluetooth low energy		Bluetooth low-energy-based beacons have two different roles: "broadcasting" (by beacon device) and "receiving" (by sensing devices). It allows devices to receive information over a short distance. Thus, many researchers are actively investigating positioning methods that use beacons. However, the distance value of positioning in the existing methods is not always accurate. This article proposes a novel three-dimensional positioning system using Bluetooth low-energy-based beacons. While the conventional methods measure distances by obtaining two-dimensional coordinates (x, y) through the received signal strength indicator value, the proposed method improves the measurement accuracy by obtaining three-dimensional coordinate values (x, y, z). Finally, while comparing the performance of this new method with that of existing methods, the proposed three-dimensional positioning system reduces the positioning error rate by 27.3% compared to the existing two-dimensional triangulation method.

The bimorph generator is in cantilever beam structure formed by laminating two lead zirconate titanate thick-film layers on both sides of a stainless steel substrate. Aiming to scavenge vibration energy efficiently from the environment and transform into useful electrical energy, the two piezoelectric layers on the device can be poled for serial and parallel connections to enhance the output voltage or output current respectively. In addition, a tungsten proof mass is bonded at the tip of the device to adjust the resonance frequency. The experimental result shows superior performance the generator. At the 0.5 g base excitation acceleration level, the devices pooled for serial connection and the device poled for parallel connection possess an open-circuit output voltage of 11.6 VP-P and 20.1 VP-P, respectively. The device poled for parallel connection reaches a maximum power output of 423 mu W and an output voltage of 15.2 VP-P at an excitation frequency of 143.4 Hz and an externally applied based excitation acceleration of 1.5 g, whereas the device poled serial connection achieves a maximum power output of 413 mu W and an output voltage of 33.0 VP-P at an excitation frequency of 140.8 Hz and an externally applied base excitation acceleration of 1.5 g. To demonstrate the feasibility of the MEMS generator for real applications, we finished the demonstration of a self-powered Bluetooth low energy wireless temperature sensor sending readings to a smartphone with only the power from the MEMS generator harvesting from vibration.

Simplicity in management and a smooth, creative integration of everyday life objects empowered by digital technology in our own environment are two key factors for a successful penetration of Internet of Things (IoT). We present UDOO IoT, a combined set of open hardware (UDOO Quad, Blu and Bricks) and open software (UAPPI, an extension of MIT App Inventor) technologies that allow novices from their early steps in the maker's world to create their own digital objects connected to the cloud, easily defining custom behavior logic for sensors and actuators. UDOO IoT is illustrated through one of the field studies carried out along its design process.

The main components are Radio Frequency IDentification (RFID), Bluetooth Low Energy (BLE) tags and smartphones. The core functions are performed by two Android applications, which implement asset tracking and searching. The main merits of the architecture are its ability to maximize smartphone battery lifetime, that can reach an entire working shift, very satisfactory accuracy of BLE tag-smartphone distance estimation (with a mean error around 2 [m]), high probability of detecting all the tags present in the construction site, as well as a suitably short Aging time.

J	Afonso, JA; Maio, AJF; Simoes, R				Afonso, Jose Augusto; Maio, Antonio Jose F.; Simoes, Ricardo			Performance Evaluation of Bluetooth Low Energy for High Data Rate Body Area Networks	WIRELESS PERSONAL COMMUNICATIONS			English	Article						Bluetooth Low Energy; Performance evaluation; Body area networks; Quality of service	TECHNOLOGIES; PROTOCOL; INTERNET; SENSOR; THINGS; CARE	Bluetooth Low Energy (BLE) is a promising wireless network technology, in the context of body area network (BAN) applications, to provide the required quality of service support concerning the communication between sensor nodes placed on a user's body and a personal device, such as a smartphone. Most previous BLE performance studies in the literature have focused primarily in networks with a single slave (point-to-point link) or traffic scenarios with relatively low data rate. However, many BAN sensors generate high data rate traffic, and several sensor nodes (slaves) may be actively sending data in the same BAN. Therefore, this work focuses on the evaluation of the suitability of BLE mainly under these conditions. Results show that, for the same traffic, the BLE protocol presents lower energy consumption and supports more sensor nodes than an alternative IEEE 802.15.4-based protocol. This study also identifies and characterizes some implementation constraints on the tested platforms that impose limits on the achievable performance.

BlueVoice: Voice communications over Bluetooth Low Energy in the Internet of Things scenario	COMPUTER COMMUNICATIONS			English	Article						Internet of Things; Bluetooth Low Energy; Speech services	SENSOR NETWORKS; WIRELESS	Bluetooth Low Energy (Bluetooth LE) is a key technology in the envisioned Internet of Things (IoT) scenario. In fact, its extremely low-power characteristics make it one of the most suitable solutions to enable wireless communications among battery powered IoT objects ubiquitously deployed in the field with the aim of building smart environments. Although Bluetooth LE specification targets a specific set of applications mainly devoted to monitoring purposes, innovative solutions can lead to the adoption of such technology in different applications, such as multimedia streaming, allowing IoT objects to exploit new functionalities. In this direction this article presents BlueVoice, an application targeted to Bluetooth LE devices to enable speech streaming services. In the article BlueVoice is presented by first detailing the services set extension needed to support the new envisioned multimedia service, then a description of application choices is given, followed by an evaluation of its performance in real IoT objects. Thanks to the selected speech encoding technique, connection design choices and packetization strategies, BlueVoice application requires a communication bandwidth of 64.3 kbps to transmit audio at 16 kHz in ADPCM format. BlueVoice performance has been evaluated in terms of power consumption, memory and processing requirements, showing feasibility of the developed solution in resource constrained devices, thus confirming the correct choices in the application design. The set of performance information obtained show that BlueVoice is a viable solution to enable speech communications in ubiquitous wireless IoT nodes based on the Bluetooth LE technology.

The proposed standard-compliant enhancement, BLE with timing channels (BLE-TC), improves the energy efficiency of an energy-constrained connectionless BLE transmitter by encoding additional information in the interarrival time between BLE advertisements. BLE-TC is analytically compared with the connectionless BLE standard. Using realistic timing noise that is empirically determined through a proof-of-concept implementation, the results indicate that more than 10% improvement in energy efficiency can be achieved for low-throughput applications, such as smart metering and environmental sensing for smart cities.

Applying Seamful Design in Location-Based Mobile Museum Applications	ACM TRANSACTIONS ON MULTIMEDIA COMPUTING COMMUNICATIONS AND APPLICATIONS			English	Article						Design; Human Factors; Experimentation; Human-computer interaction; museum studies; game design; smart-phone games; mobile games; location based gaming; seamful design; multimodal interaction; mobile	TECHNOLOGY	The application of mobile computing is currently altering patterns of our behavior to a greater degree than perhaps any other invention. In combination with the introduction of power-efficient wireless communication technologies, such as Bluetooth Low Energy (BLE), designers are today increasingly empowered to shape the way we interact with our physical surroundings and thus build entirely new experiences. However, our evaluations of BLE and its abilities to facilitate mobile location-based experiences in public environments revealed a number of potential problems. Most notably, the position and orientation of the user in combination with various environmental factors, such as crowds of people traversing the space, were found to cause major fluctuations of the received BLE signal strength. These issues are rendering a seamless functioning of any location-based application practically impossible. Instead of achieving seamlessness by eliminating these technical issues, we thus choose to advocate the use of a seamful approach, that is, to reveal and exploit these problems and turn them into a part of the actual experience. In order to demonstrate the viability of this approach, we designed, implemented, and evaluated the Ghost Detector-an educational location-based museum game for children. By presenting a qualitative evaluation of this game and by motivating our design decisions, this article provides insight into some of the challenges and possible solutions connected to the process of developing location-based BLE-enabled experiences for public cultural spaces.

Indoor positioning systems have a huge market in the retail sector and contextual advertising; in addition, they can be fundamental to increasing the quality of life for citizens if deployed inside public buildings such as hospitals, airports, and museums. Sometimes, in emergency situations, they can make the difference between life and death. Various approaches have been proposed in the literature. Recently, thanks to the high performance of smartphones' cameras, marker-less and marker-based computer vision approaches have been investigated. In a previous paper, we proposed a technique for indoor localization and navigation using both Bluetooth low energy (BLE) and a 2D visual marker system deployed into the floor. In this paper, we presented a qualitative performance evaluation of three 2D visual markers, Vuforia, ArUco marker, and AprilTag, which are suitable for real-time applications. Our analysis focused on specific case study of visual markers placed onto the tiles, to improve the efficiency of our indoor localization and navigation approach by choosing the best visual marker system.

J	Wen, XY; Tao, WY; Own, CM; Pan, ZJ				Wen, Xiaoyang; Tao, Wenyuan; Own, Chung-Ming; Pan, Zhenjiang			On the Dynamic RSS Feedbacks of Indoor Fingerprinting Databases for Localization Reliability Improvement	SENSORS			English	Article						location estimation; RSS fingerprinting; Bluetooth low energy; adaptive RSS fingerprint; feedbacks		Location data is one of the most widely used context data types in context-aware and ubiquitous computing applications. To support locating applications in indoor environments, numerous systems with different deployment costs and positioning accuracies have been developed over the past decade. One useful method, based on received signal strength (RSS), provides a set of signal transmission access points. However, compiling a remeasurement RSS database involves a high cost, which is impractical in dynamically changing environments, particularly in highly crowded areas. In this study, we propose a dynamic estimation resampling method for certain locations chosen from a set of remeasurement fingerprinting databases. Our proposed method adaptively applies different, newly updated and offline fingerprinting points according to the temporal and spatial strength of the location. To achieve accuracy within a simulated area, the proposed method requires approximately 3% of the feedback to attain a double correctness probability comparable to similar methods; in a real environment, our proposed method can obtain excellent 1 m accuracy errors in the positioning system.

An all-digital PLL employs a digitally controlled oscillator with switching current sources to reduce supply voltage and power without sacrificing its startup margin. It also reduces 1/f noise and supply pushing, thus allowing the ADPLL, after settling, to reduce its sampling rate or shut it off entirely during a direct DCO data modulation. The switching power amplifier integrates its matching network while operating in class-E/F-2 to maximally enhance its efficiency at low voltage. The transmitter is realized in 28 nm digital CMOS and satisfies all metal density and other manufacturing rules. It consumes 3.6 mW/5.5 mW while delivering 0 dBm/3 dBm RF power in Bluetooth Low-Energy mode.

It can detect 3-lead ECG signals and is completely wireless. Secondly the digital Compressed Sensing (CS) is implemented to increase the energy efficiency of wireless ECG sensor. Different sparsifying basis, various compression ratio (CR) and several reconstruction algorithms are simulated and discussed. Finally the reconstruction is done by the android application (App) on smartphone to display the signal in real time. The power efficiency is measured and compared with the system without CS. The optimum satisfying basis built by 3-level decomposed db4 wavelet coefficients, 1-bit Bernoulli random matrix and the most suitable reconstruction algorithm are selected by the simulations and applied on the sensor node and App. The signal is successfully reconstructed and displayed on the App of smartphone. Battery life of sensor node is extended from 55 h to 67 h. The presented wireless ECG system with CS can significantly extend the battery life by 22 %.

Negative gate biasing of the main PA transistor in sleep mode achieves a 30x reduction in sleep-mode power without incurring on-performance degradation. The PA achieves a peak output power of +10.9 dBm and a total TX efficiency of 43.7%. A phase-locked loop is integrated, with direct modulation capability for the 1 Mbps GFSK modulation of Bluetooth Low Energy (BLE). The transmitter also includes a digital baseband with BLE support. Low voltage operation down to 0.68 V results in savings of both active switching power and leakage. Extensive power gating of all the blocks results in a total leakage of 370 pW for an on/off power ratio of 7.4x10(7).

The sensor system reports the temperature and color sensor output frequency change of the culture bottle when the device is triggered. After the culture process is finished, a nitrite ion detecting solution based on a commercial nitrite ion detection kit is injected into the culture bottle by a syringe pump to check bacterial growth by the formation of a pigment by the reaction between the solution and the color sensor. Sensor status and NRA results are broadcasted via a Bluetooth low energy beacon. An Android application was developed to collect the broadcasted data, classify the status of cultured samples from multiple devices, and visualize the data for the end users, circumventing the need to examine each culture bottle manually during a long culture period. The authors expect that usage of the developed sensor will decrease the cost and required labor for handling large amounts of patient samples in local health centers in developing countries. All 3D-printerable hardware parts, a circuit diagram, and software are available online.

J	Kim, MS; Lee, JG; Kang, SJ				Kim, Min Su; Lee, Jae Geun; Kang, Soon Ju			A Self-Organizing Interaction and Synchronization Method between a Wearable Device and Mobile Robot	SENSORS			English	Article						mobile robot; human following or leading; LF/RF pairing; device-to-device synchronization	SENSOR	In the near future, we can expect to see robots naturally following or going ahead of humans, similar to pet behavior. We call this type of robots "Pet-Bot". To implement this function in a robot, in this paper we introduce a self-organizing interaction and synchronization method between wearable devices and Pet-Bots. First, the Pet-Bot opportunistically identifies its owner without any human intervention, which means that the robot self-identifies the owner's approach on its own. Second, Pet-Bot's activity is synchronized with the owner's behavior. Lastly, the robot frequently encounters uncertain situations (e.g., when the robot goes ahead of the owner but meets a situation where it cannot make a decision, or the owner wants to stop the Pet-Bot synchronization mode to relax). In this case, we have adopted a gesture recognition function that uses a 3-D accelerometer in the wearable device. In order to achieve the interaction and synchronization in real-time, we use two wireless communication protocols: 125 kHz low-frequency (LF) and 2.4 GHz Bluetooth low energy (BLE). We conducted experiments using a prototype Pet-Bot and wearable devices to verify their motion recognition of and synchronization with humans in real-time. The results showed a guaranteed level of accuracy of at least 94%. A trajectory test was also performed to demonstrate the robot's control performance when following or leading a human in real-time.

In this paper, we propose an algorithm that uses the combination of channel-separate polynomial regression model (PRM), channel-separate fingerprinting (FP), outlier detection and extended Kalman filtering (EKF) for smartphone-based indoor localization with BLE beacons. The proposed algorithm uses FP and PRM to estimate the target's location and the distances between the target and BLE beacons respectively. We compare the performance of distance estimation that uses separate PRM for three advertisement channels (i.e., the separate strategy) with that use an aggregate PRM generated through the combination of information from all channels (i.e., the aggregate strategy). The performance of FP-based location estimation results of the separate strategy and the aggregate strategy are also compared. It was found that the separate strategy can provide higher accuracy; thus, it is preferred to adopt PRM and FP for each BLE advertisement channel separately. Furthermore, to enhance the robustness of the algorithm, a two-level outlier detection mechanism is designed. Distance and location estimates obtained from PRM and FP are passed to the first outlier detection to generate improved distance estimates for the EKF. After the EKF process, the second outlier detection algorithm based on statistical testing is further performed to remove the outliers. The proposed algorithm was evaluated by various field experiments. Results show that the proposed algorithm achieved the accuracy of <2.56 m at 90% of the time with dense deployment of BLE beacons (1 beacon per 9 m), which performs 35.82% better than <3.99 m from the Propagation Model (PM) + EKF algorithm and 15.77% more accurate than <3.04 m from the FP + EKF algorithm. With sparse deployment (1 beacon per 18 m), the proposed algorithm achieves the accuracies of <3.88 m at 90% of the time, which performs 49.58% more accurate than <8.00 m from the PM + EKF algorithm and 21.41% better than <4.94 m from the FP + EKF algorithm. Therefore, the proposed algorithm is especially useful to improve the localization accuracy in environments with sparse beacon deployment.

This technology makes it possible for a large number of devices to be connected to the Internet of Things. The BLE mechanism is clearly defined by the standard, however, there is room for improvements in some aspects of the technology such as the discovery process. Although the discovery process of traditional Bluetooth architecture has been intensively investigated through analytical and simulation models over the years, it cannot be applied to the BLE technology because of many changes introduced in the design of the BLE. Recently, there have been several works for performance evaluation of BLE discovery process, but they are not still thorough enough in providing a holistic analysis of the BLE. This has motivated our study for more accurate modeling of the BLE discovery process. Our work focuses on developing an analytical model and carrying out intensive simulations to investigate discovery probability and quantitative examination of the influence of parameter settings on the discovery latency and the energy performance metric of the discovery process.

J	Basalamah, A				Basalamah, Anas			Oppotunistic crowdsensing framework for Internet of things using Bluetooth low energy	JOURNAL OF ENGINEERING-JOE			English	Article								Researchers have leveraged modern day sensor rich smartphones to collect crowdsourced data and analyse it for different phenomenon of interests. Crowdsensing applications must bear with the limited energy, sensing, and computational resources available on the phone. To relief some burden from the smartphones, the authors envision a new crowdsourcing architecture where low-cost, low-energy sensors embedded in objects around us, i.e. walls, traffic lights, and billboards, providing a variety of sensors depending on their context, e.g. AirQuality, temperature. These devices would carry on the sensing, processing, and broadcasting of sensor data using wireless interfaces. Smartphones on the other hand, would opportunistically discover and collect data from these devices to provide a much better, richer, and energy-efficient sensing infrastructure. They discuss the usage of Bluetooth low energy (BLE) as a new energy-efficient sensing resource for crowdsensing. They focus on defining a unified BLE sensing framework, which provides a number of smart sensing schemes to ease the development of energy efficient and context aware crowdsensing applications. They also provide an open-source library that allows developers to utilise this framework and acts as a layer to support opportunistic crowdsensing out of the box.

Development of a Wearable Cardiac Monitoring System for Behavioral Neurocardiac Training: A Usability Study	JMIR MHEALTH AND UHEALTH			English	Article						mobile health; smartphones; sensor devices and platforms; wireless technology; mobile applications; electrocardiography; biofeedback, psychology; blood pressure; stress, physiological; relaxation	HYPERTENSION	Background: Elevated blood pressure is one of the main risk factors for death globally. Behavioral neurocardiac training (BNT) is a complementary approach to blood pressure and stress management that is intended to exercise the autonomic reflexes, improve stress recovery, and lower blood pressure. BNT involves cognitive-behavioral therapy with a paced breathing technique and heart rate variability biofeedback. BNT is limited to in-clinic delivery and faces an accessibility barrier because of the need for clinical oversight and the use of complex monitoring tools. Objective: The objective of this project was to design, develop, and evaluate a wearable electrocardiographic (ECG) sensor system for the delivery of BNT in a home setting. Methods: The wearable sensor system, Beat, consists of an ECG sensor and a mobile app. It was developed iteratively using the principles of test-driven Agile development and user-centered design. A usability study was conducted at Toronto General Hospital to evaluate feasibility and user experience and identify areas of improvement. Results: The Beat sensor was designed as a modular patch to be worn on the user's chest and uses standard ECG electrodes. It streams a single-lead ECG wirelessly to a mobile phone using Bluetooth Low Energy. The use of small, low-power electronics, a low device profile, and a tapered enclosure allowed for a device that can be unobtrusively worn under clothing. The sensor was designed to operate with a mobile app that guides users through the BNT exercises to train them to a slow-paced breathing technique for stress recovery. The BNT app uses the ECG captured by the sensor to provide heart rate variability biofeedback in the form of a real-time heart rate waveform to complement and reinforce the impact of the training. Usability testing (n=6) indicated that the overall response to the design and user experience of the system was perceived positively. All participants indicated that the system had a positive effect on stress management and that they would use it at home. Areas of improvement were identified, which focused primarily on the delivery of training and education on BNT through the app. Conclusions: The outcome of this project was a wearable sensor system to deliver BNT at home. The system has the potential to offer a complementary approach to blood pressure and stress management at home and reduce current accessibility barriers.

But, the BLE still has many challenging issues which must be resolved before deploying it for the technologies. In this paper, an enhanced discovery mechanism is proposed for BLE devices to avoid collisions during advertisement process, so as to achieve lower latency as well as energy consumption. The proposed scheme is modeled and validated via analytical and simulation methods. The proposed mechanism has shown its effectiveness in avoiding unexpected long latency and much energy consumption by carrier sensing during discovery process in crowded BLE networks.

While mobile applications have been used with good success in managing ICSs, traditional methods of distributing applications (e.g., app stores) are not well suited to the task of discovering, distributing, and building human machine interfaces (HMIs) for ICS, as the highly individualized and often proprietary individual components of ICSs have vastly different interfaces leading to a need to download hundreds of applications. We propose the No Effort Rapid Development (NERD) middleware framework to address the challenges of in-field HMI discovery, provisioning, communication, and co-evolution with related ICSs. Middleware services offer the ability to simplify on-demand HMI distribution and operation of ICSs. NERD leverages existing ICS device-markers (e.g., QR-codes or RFID tags) or Bluetooth low-energy protocols for rapid cyber-physical discovery and provisioning of HMIs in the field. Device-markers and Bluetooth low-energy protocols have a very limited data capacity and transmission speed, and to achieve on-device storage of HMIs, we propose using a compact data-driven domain-specific language that emphasizes data sources and sinks between the HMI and IC.

Recently, these smart environments are also being exploited to renovate the users' interest on the cultural heritage, by guaranteeing real interactive cultural experiences. In this paper, we design and validate an indoor location-aware architecture able to enhance the user experience in a museum. In particular, the proposed system relies on a wearable device that combines image recognition and localization capabilities to automatically provide the users with cultural contents related to the observed artworks. The localization information is obtained by a Bluetooth low energy (BLE) infrastructure installed in the museum. Moreover, the system interacts with the Cloud to store multimedia contents produced by the user and to share environment-generated events on his/her social networks. Finally, several location-aware services, running in the system, control the environment status also according to users' movements. These services interact with physical devices through a multiprotocol middleware. The system has been designed to be easily extensible to other IoT technologies and its effectiveness has been evaluated in the MUST museum, Lecce, Italy.

Presently, five clinical performance indicators are used to decide patient satisfaction. Unfortunately, the emergency ambulance services in rapidly growing metropolitan areas do not meet current satisfaction expectations; because of human errors in the management of the objects onboard the ambulances. But, human involvement in the information management of emergency interventions can be reduced by electronic tracking of personnel, assets, consumables and drugs (PACD) carried in the ambulances. Electronic tracking needs the support of automation software, which should be integrated to the overall hospital information system. Our work presents a complete solution based on a centralized database supported by radio frequency identification (RFID) and bluetooth low energy (BLE) identification and tracking technologies. Each object in an ambulance is identified and tracked by the best suited technology. The automated identification and tracking reduces manual paper documentation and frees the personnel to better focus on medical activities. The presence and amounts of the PACD are automatically monitored, warning about their depletion, non-presence or maintenance dates. The computerized two way hospital-ambulance communication link provides information sharing and instantaneous feedback for better and faster diagnosis decisions. A fully implemented system is presented, with detailed hardware and software descriptions. The benefits and the clinical outcomes of the proposed system are discussed, which lead to improved personnel efficiency and more effective interventions. (C) 2015 Elsevier Ireland Ltd.

BLE has many advantages over classical Bluetooth technologies, including low-cost deployment and low-power consumption. Recently, a very few number of research studies have been conducted to improve device discovery process of BLE. But, these studies have still some limitations. Prior studies have assumed that advertising PDUs are immediately processed as long as they are received successfully by a scanner. Practically, however, BLE devices may experience lots of collisions due to contention among neighbors, particularly in a crowded environment. With increasing number of BLE devices, delays of both device discovery and connection setup keep exponential growth, which could influence user experience in terms of either time or energy consumption. In this paper, an enhanced mechanism is proposed to enable BLE advertisers and scanners to learn the network contention and adjust their parameters accordingly, so as to achieve fast discovery latency. Through extensive simulations, the proposed mechanism has shown its effectiveness to reduce unexpected long latency in crowded BLE networks.

After decades of conceptual inception of the IoT, in recent years a large variety of communication technologies has gradually emerged, reflecting a large diversity of application domains and of communication requirements. Such heterogeneity and fragmentation of the connectivity landscape is currently hampering the full realization of the IoT vision, by posing several complex integration challenges. In this context, the advent of 5G cellular systems, with the availability of a connectivity technology, which is at once truly ubiquitous, reliable, scalable, and cost-efficient, is considered as a potentially key driver for the yet-to emerge global IoT. In the present paper, we analyze in detail the potential of 5G technologies for the IoT, by considering both the technological and standardization aspects. We review the present-day IoT connectivity landscape, as well as the main 5G enablers for the IoT. Last but not least, we illustrate the massive business shifts that a tight link between IoT and 5G may cause in the operator and vendors ecosystem.

In this paper we investigate the potential of BLE in a vehicular context. By means of experiments, we first evaluate the characteristics of the wireless channel, then we define a set of driving scenarios to analyse how BLE is affected by varying speed, distance and traffic conditions. We found that the maximum communication range between two devices can go beyond 100 m and that a robust connection, capable of handling sudden signal losses or interferences, can be achieved up to a distance of 50 m even for varying traffic and driving conditions. We then present a proof-of-concept mobile application for off-the-shelf smartphones that can be used to transmit data over multiple hops. Next, we analyse how BLE handles other interferences on the same frequency band by building and validating an interference testbed based on the IEEE 802.11 technology. Finally we discuss the advantages and limitations of BLE for Inter-Vehicular Communications (IVC) and propose potential applications. (C) 2015 Elsevier B.V. All rights reserved.

Sensing technologies are promising solutions that can provide cost-effective answers to these challenges. In this paper, we focus on long-term in-house activity monitoring that aims at early detection and prevention of such conditions. In this context, we present and experimentally evaluate an ultra low-power (less than 100-mu W long-term average power consumption) on-body activity sensing prototype system that is based on Bluetooth low energy (BLE). As part of a larger smart home monitoring architecture, the role of the presented system is to collect and reliably deliver acceleration data to the upper layers of the architecture. The system evaluation incorporates a thorough power consumption study that facilitates meaningful battery lifetime estimations, an insightful coverage study in an actual residential environment, and the investigation of energy-efficient packet loss mitigation techniques.

In an aging society, it is important to home care elderly and maintain their daily needs and provide safe evacuation alternatives in the case emergency. Hence, this paper aims to implement and evaluate a smart and location-aware indoor emergency evacuation system for elderly users. The prototype system employs multiple Bluetooth Low Energy and iBeacon sensors and a smartphone. The smartphone utilizes the beacon signals to estimate its location within the building and uses the sensor data transmitted by the iBeacons to identify the level of threat (if any) to the elderly user and guide him/ her to a safe zone in the case of fire, earthquake etc. Our prototype was tested in three different locations utilizing two different types of sensors. The results show that our system can detect a threat and guide the elderly user with minimum 85.47 centimeters and maximum 239.8 centimeters distance error.

It is based on a commercially available low cost hydro generator. The generator is built into a housing with optimized reduced fluidic resistance to enable operation with flow rates as low as 6 l/min. The power management combines rectification, buffering, defined start-up, and circuit protection. An MSP430FR5949 microcontroller is used for data acquisition and processing. The data are transmitted via RF, using a Bluegiga BLE112 module in advertisement mode, to a PC where the measured flow rate is stored and displayed. The transmission rate of the wireless sensor node (WSN) is set to 1 Hz if enough power is available, which is the case for flow rates above 5.5 l/min. The electronics power demand is calculated to be 340 mu W in average, while the generator is capable of delivering more than 200 mW for flow rates above 15 l/min.

Energy-autonomous wireless sensor nodes for automotive applications, powered by thermoelectric energy harvesting	16TH INTERNATIONAL CONFERENCE ON MICRO AND NANOTECHNOLOGY FOR POWER GENERATION AND ENERGY CONVERSION APPLICATIONS (POWERMEMS 2016)	Journal of Physics Conference Series		English	Proceedings Paper	16th International Conference on Micro- and Nano-Technology for Power Generation and Energy Conversion Applications (PowerMEMS)	DEC 06-09, 2016	Paris, FRANCE					In this paper we will first present the measurement of temperatures on different positions at a diesel-powered car. As a result, several locations are identified as suitable to implement a wireless sensor node powered by thermal energy harvesting. Based on the data gained a thermoelectric generator (TEG) has been selected, and measurements of energy generation have been performed. Further, a complete energy-autonomous wireless sensor node was designed, including the TEG with its mounting bracket, an electronic power management, and a Bluetooth Low Energy (BLE) sensor node. Based on temperature differences from -10 K up to 75.3 K occurring in test drives, a low power set up was chosen to achieve a system startup time below 10 minutes and to ensure service even under difficult ambient conditions, like high ambient temperatures or a slow movement of the car in stocking traffic. 2 minutes after starting the engine a power about of 10 mW is available from the chosen TEG, and in peak the power exceeds 1 W. In a 50 minute test drive it was possible to generate 650 J of energy. This information was used to develop the complete system, demonstrating the opportunity to deploy energy-autonomous wireless sensor nodes in a car, e.g. for exhaust gas monitoring. The system is used to gather sensor data, like temperature and humidity, and transmits data successfully via BLE to a prepared main node based on a Raspberry Pi.

The main idea is to use the aeroelastic behavior of thin flexible films to induce simultaneously the capacitance variations and the polarization required by the triboelectric/electrostatic conversion. This technology provides thin and flexible devices and avoids the issue of electrets discharge. Our prototypes (< 16cm(2)) allowed a quick startup (from 3ms(-1)), an electrical power-flux density from 0.1 mu W. cm(-2) to 60 mu W. cm(-2). In order to complete the energy harvesting chain, we have used a wireless sensor with temperature and acceleration measures coupled to a low power transmission (Bluetooth Low Energy) with reception on a smartphone.

For example, it can help detect areas of priority and assign emergency personnel in an efficient manner. However, occupancy detection can be a major challenge in indoor environments. A recent technology that can prove very useful in that respect is Bluetooth Low Energy (BLE), which is able to provide the location of a user using information from beacons installed in a building. Here, we evaluate BLE as the primary means of occupancy estimation in an indoor environment, using a prototype system composed of BLE beacons, a mobile application and a server. We employ three machine learning approaches (k-nearest neighbours, logistic regression and support vector machines) to determine the presence of occupants inside specific areas of an office space and we evaluate our approach in two independent experimental settings. Our experimental results indicate that combining BLE with machine learning is certainly promising as the basis for occupancy estimation.

Passive or active components are embedded in printed-circuit-board (PCB) as called as System-on-Package (SoP). A proposed module is composed of a BLE IC, a memory, a 3-axis sensor, a crystal, inductors, capacitors, and resistors. In side view, ICs and a PCB with passive components are sequentially located from top and bottom. Capacitors, inductors and resistors are embedded in PCB. In order to check the performance and size for embedded modules, two representative modules for BLE with SMT and with SoP are designed and compared. The size of module with SMT and SoP are as 11 mm x 8 mm and 6 mm x 8 mm, respectively. Almost 44.5 % size reduction is obtained by SoP. Measured Tx power in Bluetooth are given as -2.0 dBm and BLE has good performance. This paper presented that SoP technology was better than SMT technology in a view of size. Implemented module had good performance and slim size.

It could be considered also expensive since it often causes an increasing of traffic with a consequent increase of pollution. In this paper, we present a smart parking system that helps users to reach a free parking slot, in a small area or a city, using context-aware information to help in the process. The proposed solution does not require an existing infrastructure of sensors spread in parking areas since it exploits the potential of modern smartphones with their capability of recognizing user activity and position. This solution introduces an algorithm which compares routes of different drivers to find relations among them. A mechanism based on Bluetooth Low Energy Advertising (BLE Advertising) is then adopted to detect passengers and reduce the bias that would be introduced by the arrival of multiple users in the same parking area. To test the system we developed an application prototype that enables the gathering of contextual information and displays through a map an approximate distribution of free parking areas close to the user's position. A series of tests were performed to evaluate the system to estimate the advantages of a sensors-less architecture.

We want to provide a mobile robot with the capacity to autonomously determining its location inside buildings, to allow it to autonomously navigate. The solution developed is based on spreading emitter beacons of Bluetooth Low Energy in the building and use location finding techniques to determine the robot's location. The main challenge is the capacity to obtain accurate readings of signal strength and the low repeatability of readings even under unchanged conditions. To improve the signal strength measurements it is necessary to deal with this imprecision. Our approach is based on the use of Fuzzy Logic to deal with the accuracy problem. Once better signal strength readings are achieved, using this method, approximate distances are calculated based on signal strength and the trilateration method is implemented to provide the location of the mobile robot.

Bluetooth Low Energy is one of the most recent advancements for IoT and particularly appropriate for ultra-low power sensors running on Complementary Metal-Oxide Semiconductor coin cell batteries. Bluetooth Low Energy is effective option for indoor positioning frameworks which offers sensible exactness and minimal effort arrangement. An estimation strategy utilizing Bluetooth low energy labels turns out to be most enhancing and promising among different procedures for assessing area on the grounds that a most of advanced mobile phones uses Bluetooth. The BLE tags transmit advertisement packets intermittently, which incorporate one of universally unique identifier, a major and a minor value only identified with every tag. At the point when a cellphone gets the advertisement packet, the Smartphone Indoor Positioning Application initiates the scanning by turning on Bluetooth and detects a BLE tags. In this paper, received signal strength of BLE tags and transmitting power is measured first so as to take position of BLE tag for indoor situating.

In particular, the introduction of Bluetooth Low Energy (BLE) beacons has been a major catalyst for much of the recent interest in IPS. This paper focuses on the implementation and development of a simple IPS Android application using BLE beacons and the application of Kalman filtering for improved accuracy. The IPS Android application uses the filtered received signal strength indication (RSSI) to approximate the location of an Android device as it moves throughout a location that has been outfitted with BLE beacons. The location data that is generated by the application is sent to a database to allow for previous location history to be examined and to enable to application to watch the movements of tracked devices in real time.

Many researches to conserve electrical consumption have been presented. Providing residents with information on their energy consumption has become a feasible option to promote energy saving in residential sector. In this Paper, the electrical energy monitoring systems are designed based on a non-intrusive sensors, Bluetooth Low energy (BLE) and Factorial Hidden Markov Model algorithm (FHMM). Sensors placed at one point observation to measure electricity consumption on the whole load. Using the BLE as the transmission medium, measurement result are sent to the server. Server perform the disaggreagtion of electricity consumption on each load using FHMM algorithm so the user can observe the consumption of a whole load or each of them.

With these devices, indoor positioning techniques have been extensively researched. However, the positioning precision, using a single Wi-Fi or BLE (Bluetooth Low Energy) device, is usually limited to several meters. To improve positioning precision, we propose an approach of fingerprinting using multiple wearable BLE devices. In the initial experiments, we noticed that body obstruction leads to different signal strengths when a person with a wearable device turns around. On this basis, we further build directional maps for fingerprinting and study the potential combination of multiple devices in positioning. The experimental results in two indoor scenarios confirm that using multiple devices and directional maps help to greatly improve positioning precision to the decimeter level (more specifically 0.07m). The impact of BLE beacon density is also investigated.

There are some problems with existing methods such as PDR, ultrasound and laser range finder: installation location of measurement equipment at large site, cost for measurement equipment, and necessity of smartphone application. We focus on Bluetooth Low Energy(BLE). Currently, BLE technology is used as proximity notification for smart phones and cannot detect the exact distance between two BLE devices. This is because BLE radiowave is unstable and signal strength changes every time at the same distance. In this paper, we propose a location estimation method which utilizes BLE beacon tags and single board computers. In contrast to conventional ways using location-fixed BLE beacons, BLE beacon tags are distributed to participants at the event. Signal strengths of BLE advertising packets captured by multiple location-fixed scanners are used for location estimation. The method requires less cost for equipment and labor of installing an application. It can be used without complex initial setting. We had a data collection experiment at real large-scale exhibition. We estimate locations of participants by applying the proposed method to the collected data, then evaluate accuracy of estimation and analyse the activities such as the time of longer stay booths based on participants' occupation. As a result, we could track the movement of the participants to some meters error and find the characteristic booths based on longer-stay booths per occupations.

In the proposed system, a wireless hand gesture recognition glove for real-time translation of sign language commonly used in Taiwan is developed. To discriminate between different hand gestures, we have flex and inertial sensors embedded into the glove so that the three most important parameters, i.e., posture of the fingers, orientation of the palm, and motion of the hand, in Sign Language can be recognized without ambiguity. The finger flexion, palm orientation, and motion trajectory will be sampled periodically. Once the gesture is recognized as a valid signal, it will be encoded and sent to cell phone via Bluetooth Low Energy (BLE) for vocabulary look up. Finally, the vocabulary will be translated to speech via Google translator so that people can hear and know the meaning of the sign language.

In this paper, we proposed non-contact and low power sensors with integrated kinetic sensor for multiparameter real time monitoring. The proposed system consists of a non-contact electrocardiogram (ECG) sensor with fully integrated analog front end (AFE), a temperature sensor, an accelerometer, and a Bluetooth low energy (BLE) module. The system is small with the size of 50.5 x 15.2 x 6mm. The developed wearable glass in the system can be used by inpatient, outpatient or people with disability.

S	Zhang, H; Wentzloff, DD; Kim, HS			IEEE	Zhang, Huajun; Wentzloff, David D.; Kim, Hun Seok			Software-Defined, WiFi and BLE Compliant Back-Channel for Ultra-Low Power Wireless Communication	2016 IEEE GLOBAL COMMUNICATIONS CONFERENCE (GLOBECOM)	IEEE Global Communications Conference		English	Proceedings Paper	59th Annual IEEE Global Communications Conference (IEEE GLOBECOM)	DEC 04-08, 2016	Washington, DC	IEEE, Natl Instruments, AT & T, Huawei, Intel, Qualcomm, Nokia, Samsung, Keysight Technologies, Rohde & Schwarz				In this paper, we present an innovative back-channel wireless communication concept. The proposed back-channel communication enables ultra-low power (ULP) devices that are neither WiFi (IEEE 802.11a/g/n) nor Bluetooth Low Energy (BLE) compliant to receive messages from both WiFi and BLE transmitters. This allows communication between heterogeneous devices beyond the boundary of WiFi and BLE standards without hardware modification on already-deployed infrastructure. Back-channel messages are created in frequency shift keying (FSK) modulation format by feeding carefully crafted bit sequences in the payload of the WiFi or BLE packets. Systematic algorithms are introduced to embed any desired back-channel messages in FSK format on WiFi and/or BLE compliant packets. Using a commercial off-the-shelf (COTS) narrowband FSK receiver, we demonstrate successful reception of back-channel messages from WiFi and BLE transmitters. Although this COTS narrowband FSK receiver is not specifically designed for the back-channel communication, less than 1% packet error rate (PER) is achieved, validating the concept of software defined back-channel communication among heterogeneous wireless devices.

In the our previous work, the couple RFID passive tags were installed on motorcycles to detect the larceny conditions. The main problem was found in the last experiments that the RFID tags attached with the ignition key cannot be hung flexibly. Therefore, the BLE4.0, which is the low-power-consumption device, is dangle on the motorcycle's key and the RFID tags is installed on the bike's hidden body. The anti lost devices have been applied for responsibility of BLE-tags slave mode, installed on a key. The HM-11 BLE 4.0 module combination with an Arduino board has a function as the master mode, reading the MAC address (called ID) of BLE slave devices. The results show that the maximum distance, in which the BLE master module can detect the BLE slave's ID, is approximately 18 meters. The proposed method is reliable because the BLE devices can be hung on the key together while the motorbike is running on the speed not over than 80km/hr. Finally, the experimental results guarantee that, when relatively compared with the previous method, accuracy of the MATS is improved efficiently; moreover, this proposed system can actually be used in the real situation at the Prachinburi province, Thailand.

Because IoT devices are primarily battery-driven, Bluetooth Low Energy (BLE) networking is appealing to conserve battery life. The importance of battery life in a mobile ad hoc network increases the sensitivity of the network to cyberattacks intended to impact battery life. A Battery Exhaustion Attack can overwhelmingly exhaust the batteries of network nodes by making malicious service requests. In this paper, we present an intrusion detection and prevention approach for this type of attack. This approach requires the suspicious nodes to switch connection to the neighbors of its connected nodes periodically. When a suspicious node is identified as malicious, it is blacklisted to prevent future attacks. Even when a malicious node cannot be detected, its impact is distributed across the network in order to extend the overall network lifetime.

In this work we focus on the data collection from Bluetooth Low Energy (BLE) devices in order to identify and track data from things in real time, as well as to enhance data analysis by allowing processing in the Cloud. The paper proposes an IoT service architecture and a system implementation for a gateway service running on smart devices (tablets, smartphones) that supports generic access to BLE compliant sensors and allows on-the-fly sensor registration using an easy to use data information schema. The gateway is designed to support the processing (e.g. filtering) of sensor data before they are transferred to the cloud in example of FOG computing (that defines high bandwidth and low latency IoT distributed system). The experimental results demonstrate that the system supports real time communication and fast data collection, as the total time for data transmission (from smart sensors to the cloud) is less than 130 ms.

New commodity objects and wearables implementing Bluetooth Smart technology (Low Energy) are released everyday. In particular, the ever increasing number of discoverable devices both inside and outside a populated area gives us an encouraging insight on future research directions for this technology. In this paper, based on a sensing system developed as an Android application, we evaluate Bluetooth Classic and Low Energy discovery characteristics from a vehicular perspective. By recording information about devices nearby (e.g. the number of discovered devices, their signal strength, manufacturer information) and the GPS location we can derive interesting information about a driver's situation, as well as his/her environment. Presented results indicate that the amount of discovered devices and signal strengths are dependent on velocity and road category. Finally, future work and discussions address potential use-case applications based only on Bluetooth discovery, such as low energy and privacy friendly road and traffic context awareness.

To ensure that the proposed low power transceiver can operate at 1 Mbps data rate, FSK modulation is implemented using an all-digital phase locked-loop with direct modulation technique. The SPDT switch is integrated to share the antenna and matching network between the transmitter and receiver, thus minimizing the system cost by reducing external components. The transceiver is implemented using 1P6M 55-nm CMOS technology. The die area of the transceiver with DC-DC converter is 1.79 mm(2). The power consumption of the transmitter and receiver are 6 and 5 mW, respectively, when the output power level of the transmitter is 0 dBm.

The main tasks accomplished by the processing implemented on the computing platform are noise removal and identification of neural spikes. On-board execution of such tasks allows to identify which samples actually contain useful information. Thus, it reduces required input/output bandwidth, so that connection to the external environment can be implemented using a Bluetooth Low Energy device. The overall SoC architecture has power consumption compliant with implant-related constraints with a battery lifetime of around one-day.

We present a facile method to fabricate a disposable and flexible colorimetric [1] nitrite sensor and its urine-activated power source [2] on a hydrophobic (wax) paper through laser-assisted patterning and lamination. Such device, integrated with interface circuitry and a Bluetooth low energy (BLE) module can be embedded onto a diaper, and transmit semi-quantitative UTI monitoring information in a point-of-care and autonomous fashion. The proposed nitrite sensing platform achieves a sensitivity of 1.35 ms/(mg/L) and a detection limit of 4 mg/L.

In our previous work, we had presented developmental aspects of an insole based activity and gait monitoring system-SmartStep, which is a socially acceptable, fully wireless and versatile insole. The present work describes the development of an Android application that captures the SmartStep data wirelessly over Bluetooth Low energy (BLE), computes features on the received data, runs activity classification algorithms and provides real time feedback. The development of activity classification methods was based on the the data from a human study involving 4 participants. Participants were asked to perform activities of sitting, standing, walking, and cycling while they wore SmartStep insole system. Multinomial Logistic Discrimination (MLD) was utilized in the development of machine learning model for activity prediction. The resulting classification model was implemented in an Android Smartphone. The Android application was benchmarked for power consumption and CPU loading. Leave one out cross validation resulted in average accuracy of 96.9% during model training phase. The Android application for real time activity classification was tested on a human subject wearing SmartStep resulting in testing accuracy of 95.4%.

The measured values are transmitted via Bluetooth low energy (LE) and displayed in real time on a smartphone on the outside of the MRI room. During 7 MRI image acquisitions of at least 1 min and a total duration of 25 min no Bluetooth data packets were lost. The raw measurements of the light intensity for the photoplethysmogram based heart rate measurement shows an increased noise floor by 50 LSB (least significant bit) during the MRI operation, whereas the temperature and humidity readings are unaffected. The device itself creates a magnetic resonance (MR) signal loss with a radius of 14 mm around the device surface and shows no significant increase in image noise of an acquired MRI image due to its radio frequency activity. This enables continuous and unobtrusive patient monitoring during MRI scans.

Besides the well-known hearing aid, devices for detection of sound events that occur at home or at work (e.g. doorbell, telephone) are available. Despite the technological progress in the last years and resulting new possibilities, the basic functions and concepts of such devices have not changed. The user still needs special assistive technology that is bound to the home or work environment. In this contribution a new concept for awareness of events in buildings is presented. In contrast to state-of-the-art assistive devices, it makes use of modern Information and Communication and home automation technology, and thus offers the prospect of cheap implementation and higher comfort for the user. In this concept events are indicated by notifications that are send over a Bluetooth Low Energy mesh network from a source to the user. The notifications are received by the user's smartwatch and the event is indicated by vibration and an icon representing its source.

EnerCage-HC2 is equipped with multi-coil wireless power transmission (WPT), closed-loop power control, bidirectional data communication via Bluetooth Low Energy (BLE), and Microsoft Kinect (R) based animal behavior tracking and analysis. The EnerCage-HC2 achieves a homogeneous power transfer efficiency (PTE) of 14% on average, with similar to 42 mW power delivered to the load (PDL) at a nominal height of 7 cm by the closed-loop power control mechanism. The Microsoft Kinect (R) behavioral analysis algorithm can not only track the animal position in real-time but also classify 5 different types of rodent behaviors: standstill, walking, grooming, rearing, and rotating. A proof-of-concept in vivo experiment was conducted on two awake freely behaving rats while successfully operating a one-channel stimulator and generating an ethogram.

Low power consumption and maximum data privacy are two parameters that make these setups deployable. With the Bluetooth protocol being enabled with smarter processing and lower energy consumption to create the Bluetooth Low Energy (BLE) segment of peripherals, the focus of this research is to investigate keyless entry systems using this technology. The system has been prototyped using the Programmable System on Chip (PSoC-4 BLE) from Cypress Semiconductors with a BLE peripheral as the host and the user smartphone as the client. The user will advertise through the smartphone BLE and a predefined whitelist at the client end decides which host is granted access. Development was concentrated on taking maximum advantage of the power saving modes available in BLE. There were a considerable number of design issues and tradeoffs that needed to be considered were and looked into. Design issues and tradeoffs between parameters such as optimal scan duty cycle, scan range, power consumption and minimum authentication time have been discussed with implementation results.

Aiming at unleashing the potential of these proximity-based services, it is essential to devise robust techniques enabling smart devices to know their proximity close neighbors and be able to communicate with each other. To this end, we propose, design, and evaluate a robust framework capable to successfully co-localizewalking groups of mobile users, in real-time and in a centralized manner. It leverages Bluetooth low energy technology to achieve a high degree of co-location accuracy. From the collected radio signals, we construct a graph network in which the distance between pairwise vertices represents the connection strength between mobile users. Then, we propose a modified version of edge betweenness techniques, with an average path length, as a key enabler for a high clustering accuracy. We analyze the performance in terms of clustering accuracy of the proposed scheme. First, we assess its performance numerically. Then, we conduct analysis on the experimental data set to demonstrate the feasibility and the efficiency of our method. Through obtained results, we have shown that our method can be successfully applied to co-localize people walking as part of the same group.

This wastes valuable time and energy. There are various ways to automate the process of taking attendance such as fingerprint recognition, identity card scanner, Bluetooth sensors, bar code readers for identity cards and so on. This paper is aimed at implementing a Bluetooth low energy based attendance management system. It uses the Bluetooth Low Energy technology of beacons which communicate with an android application. The application is used to collect the data from the sensors and store it according to the dates. This provides a way for the teacher to instantly record and analyze the attendance of all the students. Methods of avoiding proxies or false attendances have also been incorporated.

Such networks are being increasingly used to acquire sensory data that need to be processed in real-time. The Bluetooth Low Energy (BLE) protocol is an attractive solution for implementing low-cost IWSN with reduced energy consumption and high flexibility. However, the current BLE standard does not provide real-time support for data packets and is limited to a star topology. This paper presents a real-time protocol for industrial wireless mesh networks that is developed on top of the BLE and overcomes these limitations. The paper describes the protocol and provides analysis and experimental results.

Inertial sensors widespread use within embedded systems also prompted the development of algorithms to cope with their inherent inaccuracy.

Physical Unclonable Keys for Smart Lock Systems using Bluetooth Low Energy	PROCEEDINGS OF THE IECON 2016 - 42ND ANNUAL CONFERENCE OF THE IEEE INDUSTRIAL ELECTRONICS SOCIETY	IEEE Industrial Electronics Society		English	Proceedings Paper	42nd Annual Conference of the IEEE-Industrial-Electronics-Society (IECON)	OCT 24-27, 2016	Florence, ITALY	IEEE Ind Elect Soc, Inst Elect & Elect Engineers		Bluetooth Low Energy; Physical unclonable functions; PUFs; Security applications; Electronic systems on chip		Nowadays, several smart lock systems use Bluetooth Low Energy (BLE) to stablish a wireless communication between the physical key (key fob, card, smartphone, etc.) and the lock. Security is based on creating and storing secret digital keys to establish a cryptographically secure communication. The problem is that several attacks can break such security, particularly the copy of the physical key. In order to increase the difficulty of the attacks, the physical keys described in this paper do not store the secret cryptographic keys but reconstruct them when they are needed and remove them when they are not used. Only the trusted physical keys are able to reconstruct the secrets with the public data stored in them. This is possible by using the start-up values of the SRAM in the BLE chip of the physical key, which acts as a physical unclonable function (PUF), so that if the physical key is copied, the lock cannot be opened. The idea has been proven with the development of a smart lock system with key fobs based on the CC2541 BLE system on chip from Texas Instruments. Experimental results are included to illustrate the performance.	[Prada-Delgado, M.

A major challenge in designing an IoT network is to achieve coexistence between different wireless technologies sharing the unlicensed 2.4 GHz ISM spectrum. Although there is significant literature on coexistence between IEEE 802.15.4 and IEEE 802.11, the coexistence of Bluetooth Low Energy (BLE) with other technologies remains understudied. In this work, we examine coexistence between IEEE 802.15.4, BLE and IEEE 802.11, which are widely used in residential and industrial wireless applications. We perform a mathematical analysis of the effect of cross technology interference on the reliability of the affected wireless network in the physical (PHY) layer. We also set up and perform PHY layer experiments to verify the analytical results. Finally, we extend the study to the Medium Access Control (MAC) layer. Our findings show that, even though the MAC layer mechanisms of IEEE 802.15.4 and BLE improve reliability, cooperative solutions are required to achieve coexistence.

The energy cost per bit of the RF device is only 2.9 pJ/bit, compared with over 10 nJ/bit for conventional Bluetooth Low Energy (BLE) transmitters. As a result, sensors communicating through backscatter modulation can increase their communication range at low energy cost per bit when equipped with a quantum tunneling reflector. Although the tunnel diode is highly non-linear, the measured SNR is approximately linear for increasing impinging powers; moreover, by amplifying signals below -55 dBm, the tunneling reflector achieves high sensitivities and extends by a factor of four the range of a backscatter system with respect to the signal-to-noise ratio.

Smart gadgets like fitness trackers monitor sport exercises and daily movements of the wearer. Sensor data is wirelessly transferred to smartphones and processed by sports and fitness apps. Depending on the application, a single sensor might not be sufficient. In ubiquitous computing, sport science and medicinal appliances, complex scenarios require multiple distributed sensors. However proper sensor data fusion is not possible without precise time synchronization among all units. The common wireless technology of wearables is Bluetooth Low Energy (BLE), which is integrated in every nowadays smartphone. But the architecture of BLE makes implementation of accurate time synchronization nearly impossible due to nondeterministic delays. In this paper we present two principles to obtain precise synchronization hardware time stamps, based on the power consumption of BLE System on Chips (SoC). Our concept exceeds the best-known accuracy for BLE and is more energy-efficient compared to related work. Using a common BLE SoC, we achieved a standard deviation of 0.9 microseconds.

In order to provide scalability, one promising way to collect data from BLE sensors is to utilize the existing population of smartphones in their range as relays to the cloud. In this case, providing reliable data transfer becomes complicated due to challenges such as the varying smartphone density, the sleep cycle of the sensors, and the varying Internet connectivity or unreliability of the smartphones. Therefore, this paper proposes a reliable data transfer protocol that builds upon some of the principles of TCP to address the aforementioned challenges. The protocol is evaluated using computer simulations and a hardware prototype is implemented. The evaluations not only show that the proposed protocol provides reliable data transfer, but also how to configure the parameters of the protocol to ensure energy-efficiency.

Typically, data transmitted by BLE sensors would be collected by smartphones within their range and uploaded to the cloud. In this case, there is a probability that sensor data is lost if there are no smartphones present at the time of transmission. Eventually, this may cause significant gaps in the data collected at the cloud. This paper addresses this challenge through a novel scheduling algorithm for BLE sensors that uses binary trees to reduce the gaps in collected data, while considering varying smartphone density. The algorithm is evaluated using computer simulations and a hardware prototype is implemented. The evaluations illustrate that gaps are indeed reduced in the collected data, and shows how the parameters of the protocol can be configured in different conditions.

In order to work in complete unknown indoor environments, the robot needs to map its surroundings. This is done via the simultaneous localization and mapping (SLAM) algorithm. However, the SLAM algorithm does not provide additional context to the generated map. If this information is required, it needs to be provided by the operator. With Bluetooth Low Energy (BLE) technology, position dependent information can be annotated to the generated map without operator input. BLE beacons need to be positioned at points of interest for the robot and then need to be localized. Because the BLE beacon broadcasts an ID, localization is based on the Received Signal Strength Indication (RSSI). This paper presents an approach to localize BLE beacons in the RADIO indoor environment. The robot has one BLE receiver which must be used cleverly in order to triangulate the BLE beacons position.

Therefore, the test object or person is equipped with a BLE node and approximately central in each room a low-cost and low-power BLE sensor is placed. No stringent installation requirements or battery replacement is needed for these sensors. They send advertising packets to the mobile node, where the received data is processed quickly, based on the signal strength of the received messages, characterized by the Received Signal Strength Indicator (RSSI). No fingerprinting, propagation characteristics or trilateral statistics are needed to determine in which room the test object or person is located by use of the measured RSSI values. In this paper, the localization is done by a BLE development kit of Bluegiga. Measuring in a real-life environment, we can locate at room resolution a device during more than 90% of the time, without the need for a difficult installation procedure or battery replacements on a regular basis.

Relations between animals are important because of animals welfare and can influence on animal health and productivity. In the early stage of the research, relations between animals were determined on the base of the distance between animals and described as like/not like" (they like each other or not). It's difficult to precisely determine when animals like each other. Not only distance is the criterium but also time and direct behavior. The experiment was carried out in the cowshed with 70 dairy cows. BLE Beacons (Bluetooth Low Energy Beacons) were attached to the cows and they regularly transmitted data about the cows' localisation in the cowshed to the smartphones which were distributed in the cowshed. From smartphones with Android system data were sent to the relational database. Because of the large amount of data, in the database data were processed, i.e. aggregated. Some of the data were transformed to the geometric form and then, thanks to the specially developed application, these geometric data were mapped to relations and written in the graph database. Graph databases are very useful tool to analyse and show relations between animals. The Neo4j technology was used to prepare the graph database. Other ICT technologies used in this work were: SQL Server 2014, Visual Studio 2015 and Entity Framework 6. Relational databases are still very usefull to analyse data and the graph databases are especially useful to visualize the spatial relations between objects. New technologies allows to widen our perceptions and create new possibilities of getting knowledge. There are a lot of tools to connect these technoogies, but it requires multidisciplinary approach.

Especially, the BLE shows promising results in different fields such as Internet of Things (IoT), health-care, body area networks, etc. As a result of dramatic increase in the wireless device, the frequency interference in 2.4 GHz Industrial Scientific Medical (ISM) band has raised, resulting a higher packet loss. In this paper, we propose Fast Adaptive Frequency Hopping Scheme (FAFH) to mitigate the effects of interference in BLE. The proposed FAFH scheme immediately hops to a new channel without waiting for completion of the current connection event when the channel quality becomes worse by interference. The simulation results show that the FAFH performs better in dense wireless networks as well as improved performances comparing to AFH scheme.

Using Beacons for Creating Comprehensive Virtual Profiles	UBIQUITOUS COMPUTING AND AMBIENT INTELLIGENCE, UCAMI 2016, PT II	Lecture Notes in Computer Science		English	Proceedings Paper	10th International Conference on Ubiquitous Computing and Ambient Intelligence (UCAmI)	NOV 29-DEC 02, 2016	San Bartolome de Tirajana, SPAIN	Univ Las Palmas Gran Canaria, MAmI Res Grp		Internet of Things; People as a Service; Beacons; Bluetooth low energy	CONTEXT-AWARE; INTERNET; MOBILE; THINGS	The number of Internet of Things systems in which the general population is involved keeps increasing. At the same time, the configuration and adaptation of these systems to their users' preferences are still mostly manual. To achieve a better personalization of these systems comprehensive virtual profiles of their users, including as much information as possible, is needed. One of the most relevant information of a user virtual profile is his location. With the rise of the bluetooth low energy protocol and the appearance of the beacon technology, indoor positioning of smartphone owners can be added to these virtual profiles. However, the lack of a beacon standard and the low level information provided by these devices is hindering its adoption. To solve this, this paper presents a Beacon Management System that abstracts applications developers from the low level details of the different beacons protocols and allows the management of unregistered beacons. The proposed system has been integrated into the People as a Service computation model and in the commercial platform nimBees to improve the creation of virtual profiles in IoT applications.

This work describes the idea and operation of a mobile application to combat domestic violence. Among the main technologies that are used in the implementation of the proposal are Android, BLE and LTE. If an offender gets close to a victim, even if the established threshold distance has not been broken, the victim is warned thanks to the application. Besides, if the threshold distance is broken, automatic streaming of a real-time video is sent to the police and a list of stored contacts are warned so that they can try to help to protect the victim till the police arrives.

A Classic Bluetooth communication network has been proposed and designed to establish an emergency mobile ad hoc network (hereinafter referred to as Classic Bluetooth MANETs). In Classic Bluetooth MANETs, a terminal can cause an excess of connection retries and connection conflicts. These problems can slow down the time it takes to establish connections. Therefore, time-consuming connection establishment causes the degradation of the operation rate in Bluetooth MANETs. In this paper, we propose a new fast connection establishment method by using both Bluetooth Classic and Bluetooth Low Energy (BLE) technologies. We have also implemented and evaluated our proposed method through real terminal experiments. As a result, we have confirmed that the connection latency of our proposed method is almost 75 percent lower than that of Classic Bluetooth MANETs and the energy consumption of our proposed method is less than that of Classic Bluetooth MANETs.

This paper proposes an Iterative Weighted KNN (IW-KNN) indoor localization method based on RSSI (Receive Signal Strength indicator) of the BLE (Bluetooth Low Energy), which has a low power consumption and a long life expectancy. An enormous amount of RSSI are collected to build a fingerprints database. IW-KNN has three principal improvement approaches. Firstly, Euclidean distance and Cosine similarity are combined to measure the similarity of two RSSI vectors, which can take both length and direction of vector into consideration. Secondly, unlike traditional KNN (K Nearest Neighbors) which estimates a position by a majority vote of its neighbors, a weighting factor is applied to neighbors for localization. Thirdly, IW-KNN selects different iBeacons to obtain RSSI at each iteration and calculates the mean position as the final result after several iterations. Compared with several indoor localization methods, namely, traditional KNN, Similarity improved KNN, Weighted KNN, IW-KNN can estimate positions effectively and decrease the mean error by 1.5 to 2.7 meters in our experimental environment.

With the advent of Internet of Things (IoT), more and more devices get connected, each being a potential data source. One such potential source of constant data feed are sensor devices. Sensors that monitor a wide variety of environmental data such as air pressure, temperature, humidity, air constitution for specific components, etc. produce enormous amounts of data. We could easily envisage various ways of processing this data to suit various business needs. While there are various ways to monitor environmental data using complex hardware and software, there are costs associated with those approaches. One of the most important costs involves the power requirements of equipment itself. In this paper, we present an approach to monitoring environmental data using commodity hardware like the Raspberry Pi, commodity software and sensor elements. This should help serve as a simple proof-of-concept for building a power-efficient and economical environmental monitoring solution that can be scaled based on the expanse over which environmental data monitoring is desired. This solution may also be easily leveraged for other industrial applications given the vast types of sensor hardware that integrate easily with the Pi board. The use of Bluetooth Low Energy (BLE) integrated in the Pi board, along with Beacon technology for data transmissions helps serve the purpose of a power efficient solution.	[Srinivasan, V.

A goal of IoT is to make homes smarter, also thanks to the use of wireless technologies. Bluetooth low energy (BLE) has a high potential in becoming an important technology for the IoT in low power, low cost, small devices. In fact, there is a main requirement that make a wireless protocol ideal for use in the IoT, that is the energy efficiency. To this end, this paper proposes a fuzzy-based solution that determines the sleeping time of field devices, in a home automation wireless network based on BLE, in order to improve its energy efficiency. The proposed solution determines the sleeping time of field devices according to the battery level and to the ratio of throughput to workload (Th/Wl).

Available in most modern smartphones, it is a popular choice for connecting battery powered devices like sensors or beacons to mobile handsets. A low energy consumption, while being beneficial for all BLE applications, becomes a key requirement for applications containing larger numbers of BLE devices like smart home sensors or beacons in indoor localization due to the high cost of battery replacement. In this paper, we investigate the energy consumption of different BLE System on Chips (SoCs) which provide the foundation to most BLE devices. Based on extensive measurements, we present a vendor-independent model for BLE power consumption which allows energy consumption prediction from key design parameters. This helps in the tradeoff between engergy consumption and BLE performance. We concentrate on advertising mode which governs the energy consumption in popular applications like beacons.

The experiments described in this paper make use of commercially available low cost Bluetooth sensor systems. The presented method is based on field strength measurements of the received signals. Making use of the path loss model a reliable mapping procedure between measured RSSI values and distance has been established. Since RSSI measurements are subject to noise, reflections, multipath fading and other effects the obtained values can deviate considerably from the expected ones. In order to minimize these effects a sophisticated post processing of the RSSI values has been added to the localization procedure, which is performed in real time. Furthermore a novel calibration procedure is carried out during the initialization phase of the system which considerably improved the mapping accuracy between RSSI values and distance. Compared to established RSSI-based localization methods the localization accuracy could be significantly improved by applying the proposed methods. This is verified by measurements using an experimental setup.

We provide results of an investigation of the applicability of 6LoWPAN with RPL mesh networks for home and building automation use cases. The proper selection of Trickle parameters and neighbor reachable time-outs is important in the RPL protocol suite to respond efficiently to any path failure. These parameters were analyzed in the context of energy consumption w.r.t the number of control packets. The measurements were performed in an Automated Physical Testbeds (APTB). The results match the recommendation by RFC 7733 for selecting various parameters of RPL protocol suite. This paper shows the relationship between various RPL parameters and control traffic overhead during network rebuild. Comparative measurement results with Bluetooth Low Energy (BLE) in this work showed that 6Lo with RPL outperformed BLE in this use case with less control traffic overheads.

Especially, we are focusing on using advertising packet of BLE to construct ad hoc network, since the reach of advertising packet of BLE is longer than ordinary Bluetooth. We would like to use this kind of ad hoc network to develop support tool for disaster victims or group management tool to keep safety during school trip. We designed a protocol that allows us to construct ad hoc network efficiently using advertising packet of BLE.

As the first step in the device cooperation, the device discovery process is particularly important. Because of the mobility of the devices and the limitation of the energy, how to perform the device discovery process efficiently is the key of the device cooperation. However, the devices support not only one type of wireless communication modules, choose which module to perform the device discovery is the first issue to think about.

For such a network to become widely adopted, the sensors should have battery lives at least as long as a full farming season. While the standard low-power wireless sensor communication platforms, e.g., Zigbee and ANT, may potentially satisfy this requirement, they lack common hardware support in consumer devices. By using more ubiquitous technology, such as cellphones and tablets, the costs and complexity and be significantly reduced. Nearly all mobile devices currently on the market have Bluetooth capability, making it a viable wireless protocol choice. In addition, the recent release and adoption of the Bluetooth 4.0 Low Energy (BLE) standard has solidified it as a strong candidate for use in very low power, long battery life networking. This work investigates how various BLE configurations affect network size, network throughput, and sensor battery lifetimes. We present a strategy to select network parameters that achieve at least a certain sensor update interval and connection latency while simultaneously minimizing the sensor's energy requirements and data latency and conforming to network size and throughput constraints. We present a simple BLE energy model created from current consumption measurements of the commercially available TI CC2540 BLE module. The combination of this BLE energy model and a simple battery capacity model allows the estimation and validation of sufficient battery life. Sensor lifetimes on the order of multiple years can easily be achieved for large update interval and connection latency sensors, which would be typical in mobile agricultural equipment.	[Balmos, A.

In indoor environments, however, occupancy detection can be a very challenging task. A solution to this can be provided by the use of Bluetooth Low Energy (BLE) beacons installed in the building. In this work we evaluate the performance of a BLE based occupancy detection system geared towards emergency situations that take place inside buildings. The system is composed of BLE beacons installed inside the building, a mobile application installed on occupants' mobile phones and a remote control server. Our approach does not require any processing to take place on the occupants' mobile phones, since the occupancy detection is based on a classifier installed on the remote server. Our real-world experiments indicated that the system can provide high classification accuracy for different numbers of installed beacons and occupant movement patterns.

In our approach to RPL over BLE, we propose to use both of advertising and data channels of BLE to create synergistic effects between RPL and BLE to jointly achieve high energy efficiency and reliable multi-hop routing. We design an adaptation layer between BLE and RPL (ALBER) which tightly couples RPL and BLE operations together. Specifically, ALBER provides RPL control message broadcast through BLE, RPL routing metric calculation that reflects BLE link quality, and routing table update that incorporates BLE connection management. We implement ALBER in a Linux kernel to realize RPL over BLE and compare its performance with that of RPL over IEEE 802.15.4 on a multi-hop testbed network. The performance results show that our architecture is not only feasible but also provides almost perfect packet delivery performance (similar to 100%) and reduces duty-cycle up to 32% compared to RPL over IEEE 802.15.4 under varying link dynamics. Our research shows that RPL over BLE is a promising approach which can increase the utility and impact of BLE across different application domains.

The system consists of printed electrodes on a stretchable bandage substrate designed to be attached to the chest, an electronics module, and a data receiving device. The electronics unit is reversibly attached to the single-use electrode bandage to measure the ECG data. The ECG data is then transmitted to a mobile device via Bluetooth Low Energy and the mobile device then displays the data graphically and sends it further a cloud for storing and further analysis. The attained quality of the measured ECG signals is fully satisfactory to compute important cardiac parameters and after preprocessing the signal could be used for more profound analysis of ECG wave shapes.

In this case, the bluetooth MAC address of a device could be used to increase the security of pairing processes. However, current BLE devices, especially smartphones, usually use random addresses to prevent others from tracking the devices with original bluetooth MAC addresses. While devices cannot identify one another with addresses, using random address may lead to higher security risk. This study uses a smart vehicle from a major Taiwanese brand as an example to illustrate this security impact of using BLE random addresses. Afterwards, the study provides generalized security requirements based the example scenario and a scheme to fulfill the requirement.

Bluetooth Low Energy(BLE) broadcast beacon is a one of possible method to broadcast a detailed information to users. However, BLE beacon doesn't provide a way to assay an authenticity of beacon since BLE broadcast is insecure untrusted communication. Out-of-band authentication is used to improve trustworthiness for such untrusted pathway. A new authentication protocol is proposed to assay the authenticity of digital signage when the information is broadcasted via BLE beacon. The authors implement the protocol and evaluate its effectiveness.

BLE is used to transmit and receive data between nodes such as sensors, wearable devices in the Internet of Things (IoT) environment. However, there is a possibility that an encryption key for communicating between nodes is cracked because of the security vulnerability of BLE. The security vulnerability of BLE is that the length of the Temporary Key (TK) to generate the encryption key is too short. It is a fatal problem in terms of a data security. We describe how an attacker can crack the encryption key through the vulnerability. To solve this problem, we propose an improved security method that increases the length of the TK. In the conventional BLE, the encryption key can be cracked within 20 seconds. But, it may take 600,000,000,000 years when the proposed method is used. Therefore, the proposed method can ensure that it is infeasible to crack the encryption key.

The receiver (RX) employs a high-rate (up to 10 GS/s) discrete-time (DT) architecture with intermediate frequency (IF) placed beyond the 1/f noise corner of MOS devices. New multi-stage multi-rate charge-sharing bandpass filters are adapted to achieve high out-of-band linearity, low noise and low power consumption. A transmitter (TX) employs an all-digital PLL (ADPLL) with switched-current-source digitally controlled oscillator (DCO) and switching PA. An integrated on-chip matching network serves both PA and LNTA, thus allowing a 1-pin direct antenna connection with no external antenna filters. The transceiver consumes 2.75mW in RX and 3.6mW in TX when delivering 0 dBm in Bluetooth LE.

System/circuit techniques enable signal path duty cycles as low as sub-1% and result in a 35 mu A Photo Plethysmography (PPG) RX Chain - 5X lower than published state of the art - while maintaining overall SNR > 80dBFS. The signal chain is adaptively synchronized by an ultra-low power FSM and includes a 1.3 mu W 14b 1kSPS SAR A/D. Input signal-aware, real-time data path adaptation is achieved by leveraging on-the-fly algorithms running on an external microcontroller (mu C) to further reduce system energy. A programmable, asynchronous capacitive reset amplifier (PARCA) with NEF of 4.8 and dx/dt analog feature extractor demonstrate energy efficient ECG capture. A battery-powered, Bluetooth low energy (BLE) based, wearable platform with simultaneous ECG and PPG acquisition using this AFE has been demonstrated.

Our approach to localize the mobile node is based on the relative change in the RSSI values obtained from BLE network, provided the knowledge of certain area specific information. The main advantage of this approach is that even the large environmental changes in the working area creates very less effect on the localization results. A new RSSI smoothing algorithm is proposed in such a way that it reduces the effect of sudden environmental changes on RSSI values. We have also formulated an integer optimization problem, where path loss exponent is optimized subject to a given area specific information. Since this problem is Non-deterministic Polynomial-time Hard (NP-Hard), we have presented sub-optimal solution to this problem, which are far better than the state-of-the-art approaches presented in the literature. Our proposed approaches provide an accuracy of average error in distance of 1.162 meter.

In intelligent urban settings, integrated and sustainable mobility plays a key role, especially for children, whose ability to move independently throughout their neighborhood is fundamental, both for themselves and their community. Our case study comes from a stepping stone toward independent mobility, namely a group of children walking to school under adult supervision. For this scenario, we offer a tool based on wireless, wearable nodes that supports adults to safely form and manage a group of children. We describe the application requirements, generalizing them beyond this particular use case. We also offer a prototype implementation that exploits Bluetooth Low Energy connectionless communication to build bi-directional information exchange for group management. Simulations and pilot tests validate the proposed approach in terms of scalability, network performance and battery life.	[Giovanelli, D.; Milosevic, B.; Kiraly, C.; Murphy, A.

Our system builds a Bluetooth Low Energy-based multi-hop communication network using smartphones. As a low-cost alternative to pile sensors, the system uses smartphones as sensor terminals to collect data. The smartphone sensors are placed in mountainous areas, which are prone to slope failures, and establish a MANET using their built-in BLE interface. If a smartphone detects ground movement, its collected acceleration data and GPS location data are sent to a server via the BLE network. These functions are executed by an application running on the smartphones. Hence, in the proposed system, it is possible to use the smartphone as the sensor terminal as long as one that has sufficient performance for use as the sensor terminal is prepared. To show the effectiveness of the system, we performed multi-hop communication experiments using Downhill in mountains that are at risk of landslides. Results show that Downhill is able to use effectively in the warning area of slope failure.

Indoor RF power can be harvested from Wi-Fi devices in both 2.4 GHz and 5 GHz bands. Indoor photovoltaic power, while often too low to be considered useful, can be used as biasing current to improve the efficiency of the RF harvester. The proposed harvester performs impedance matching in two bands and maximum power point tracking and stores energy in a solid-state battery and a supercapcitor. Our implementation of the energy-neutral BLE beacon can broadcast every 45 seconds at the input power of 15 dBm. In terms of harvested power, our proposed system harvests more power from both bands in a miniature, low-cost circuit than the state-of-the-art from three channels in a single band. This work represents a step towards enabling a class of IoT systems to operate entirely on harvested indoor RF power.

A two-dimensional model of the power emission characteristic is derived from measurements of the radiation pattern of BLE beacons carried out in an RF chamber. The Cramer-Rao lower bound (CRLB) for position estimation is then derived for this directional power emission model.

Bluetooth Low Energy is a promising technology that provides, besides ultra-low energy properties, compatibility with most mobile units. However, apart from power efficiency, opportune and reliable information delivery is mandatory in time-critical applications. In this paper we propose an analytical model of the delay performance of Bluetooth Low Energy for connection-oriented applications under different bit error conditions. In addition to the physical over-the-air latency, we also analyze the effect of the occurrence time of an Application Layer event on the effective transmission delay. We highlight the impact of the device's processing speed and the timing configuration of the connection on the final measured latency. Simulation results validate the accuracy of the model for all the analyzed cases.

In this paper, 802.11ah and BLE technologies are evaluated and compared in a home automation scenario. The selected use case includes battery powered sensors, which generate traffic, and mains powered actuators, which consume traffic, connected through a central gateway. The performance is assessed in terms of service ratio, delay and activity factor of the transceivers. Results show that both technologies are suitable for the reference use case scenario. 802.11ah benefits from a higher throughput and lower delay jitter, whereas BLE sensors show lower activity factors and a longer battery lifetime is expected. The analysis is conducted for both fixed and variable traffic load. The performance of BLE results to be more sensitive to an increase of the traffic load with respect to 802.11ah. Eventually, the limitations of the current scenario are illustrated and alternative setups are discussed.

Many potential BLE applications are delay-sensitive which demand a fast data delivery. However, since BLE coexist with other technologies such as WiFi, ZigBee, microwave, the BLE may experience severe interference. The interference can cause the BLE connection event to be unexpectedly closed which forces the device to enter sleep mode even though there is more data to be sent. This negatively affects the performance of the BLE in terms of transmission delay which makes the BLE not suitable for delay-sensitive applications. To address this issue, we propose an extension of channel access scheme of the BLE in connection state. The proposed scheme is based on the listen-before-talk mechanism where the device should sense the channel before using it. By using Markov analysis, several performance measures are derived. Through numerical result, we show that the proposed channel access scheme can reduce the average transmission delay.

The existing indoor positioning systems based on BLE beacons employ the classical fingerprinting technique where user terminals collect signals from the beacons and do most of localization computations, requiring significant power consumption on user devices. However, constant power consumption on limited battery life of a mobile device can be problematic when it comes to supporting server-oriented tracking applications. In this paper, we propose and implement a new way of fingerprinting technique called inverse fingerprinting (Inv-FP), which is a server side BLE fingerprint system where most of the positioning computations are done by BLE sniffers and servers. We analyze various characteristics of Inv-FP in comparison with the classical beacon based fingerprinting system (FP), and demonstrate that Inv-FP can match the performance of FP but with minimal power consumption on user devices.

Various appliances like thermostats, smoke detectors, intelligent lighting systems, etc., have appeared on the market to create a smart home. Vendors have the availability over multiple wireless technologies to connect their products to the smart home and communicate with the user. The most adopted technologies are the ones that can interface directly with a mobile device such as a smartphone or tablet, without the need for an additional gateway. Within this context, Wi-Fi and Bluetooth are the dominant technologies. In this paper we look at home automation devices that have chosen to solely support Bluetooth 4.0 as communication interface. We highlight the downsides of this technology in a home setting and try to mitigate this problem by exploiting the Wi-Fi capabilities of other devices, in particular smartphones. The proposed solution realizes a Wi-Fi bridge on the smartphone that is connected to the Bluetooth device. This enables other smartphone users to connect to the Bluetooth device over the Wi-Fi network, alleviating some of the downsides of the Bluetooth technology.

The viable significance of the IoT is made conceivable through enabling technologies, for example, Wireless Sensor Networks (WSNs), essentially utilized for detecting operations. In any case, there is a principle prerequisite that makes a wireless sensing perfect for use in the IoT, which is the energy efficiency. Much of the time, the sensing devices are battery-powered, so low-power system is prime requirement.

Leveraging Bluetooth Low Energy (BLE), an iBeacon technology enabled device that can be used to establish a region around an object and identify whenever the device enters or exits the region. In this paper we introduce a reminder application which monitors our location and provide us with the corresponding reminders which we have already fed into the application. The iOS device can alert applications when we approach or leave a location using iBeacon. Each time the iOS device enters the beaconic region, the application notifies the user with the corresponding reminders. Thus this application implements Internet of things with the communication of an iBeacon with an iOS device. We envision that the application of the proposed method lead to significant time conservation and automation of the reminders.

Denial of Sleep Attacks in Bluetooth Low Energy Wireless Sensor Networks	MILCOM 2016 - 2016 IEEE MILITARY COMMUNICATIONS CONFERENCE	IEEE Military Communications Conference		English	Proceedings Paper	35th IEEE Military Communications Conference (MILCOM)	NOV 01-03, 2016	Baltimore, MD	IEEE, AFCEA, IEEE Commun Soc				Many of the benefits of an Internet of Things sensor network model stem from the extremely long service life of its base sensing layer. When data from the base sensing layer is provided by very low power technologies, such as Bluetooth Low Energy, a class of vulnerabilities called Denial of Sleep attacks can be especially devastating to the network. These attacks can reduce the lifespan of the sensing nodes by several orders of magnitude, rendering the network largely unusable. This paper investigates a Denial of Sleep attack against the Bluetooth Low Energy protocol that allows a malicious actor to rapidly drain the battery of a targeted sensing node, including power analysis, simulation results, and an example implementation. The outcome will be utilized to build better defenses and more predictable environments.

The advancement of sensor technology allows us to quickly measure our posture in every scene using consumer-grade devices such as a wrist-worn type tracking sensors, smartphones, and shoes embedded with several kinds of sensors. It is not difficult to detect correct postures of athletes who can train at fully equipped facilities. However, for ordinary users, it is necessary to use a combination of such consumer portable devices for checking proper postures during daily exercise. In this study, we present a posture detection system using sensors embedded in consumer portable devices, for the purpose of posture checking. Experiments are performed to illustrate the feasibility of our system by the use of some exercise motions.

However, wireless signals such as Bluetooth, tend to be affected by an obstruction, thus creating a non-line-of-sight (NLOS) environment. This paper proposes a statistical technique for improving the accuracy of indoor positioning using BLE technology through detecting obstructions and compensating for signal degradation caused. Several experiments are conducted to observe the obstruction effect on the signal stability, computed in this paper using standard deviation. Results show a lower standard deviation for an NLOS environment. A threshold is suggested at 2.6 dBm to detect a line-of-sight (LOS) environment. The detection accuracy of this threshold is 76.25%; thus, in most cases, the technique will be able to differentiate an LOS from an NLOS environment. Using this technique, positioning in NLOS environments show an average of 1.13 metres improvement compared to positioning without using the technique.

The algorithm integrates an Off-set triangulation algorithm and a multi-stage weighted framework. An off-set triangulation algorithm was used to provide a general method to locate the user's position. Results are integrated into a weighted framework in order to increase the adaptability of the proposed localization algorithm to different complex environments and increase the accuracy of the localization. Three experiments in different environments have been examined in order to test the performance and the limitations of this algorithm. Results show that the proposed algorithm demonstrated strong adaptability to complex non-Line-of-Sight (LOS) environments.

In day care center, caretakers are taking care records aiming to improve care receiver's Quality of Life. However, in the present situation, it's difficult for caretakers to record care receiver's activity in detail because each care worker needs to take care of several care receivers at the same time and it is a large burden. To reduce the burden of caretakers, many elderly monitoring systems have been proposed so far, but most of them are not effective in the sense that they force care receivers to use dedicated device such as smart phone and/or particular applications that are obtrusive and cumbersome for care receivers. In this paper, we propose a novel elderly monitoring system which can monitor movements/activity of multiple care receivers at the same time by estimating existence area of each of the care receivers, without burdening them. Our proposed system estimates multiple care receivers existence area only using RSSI of BLE (Bluetooth Low Energy). The feature of our proposed system is that it takes Movable-Beacon and Fixed Scanner style. We have validated the proposed system and confirmed that we can estimate multi-person's existence area at high accuracy using only BLE devices.

Since iBeacon can broadcast beacon signal every certain interval, we can adopt iBeacon instead of RFID for baby tracking. In this paper we developed a new application to obtain the necessary data from iBeacon and then derive the iBeacon path-loss model for line-of-sight (LOS) situation in in-room environment on account of RSS analysis. Besides, we apply the existing path-loss model used in Estimote iBeacons and compare the performance of those two models.

A Geomarketing system based on Bluetooth Low Energy (BLE) is developed. This BLE-based system consists of three key components (i) Server component (ii) smartphone component, and (iii) beacons (BLE). The smartphone application detects the location of customers by using BLE technology, this data will be transferred to server component by WIFI, and the server application sends personalized promotions such as mobile advertisements or e-coupons to customers' smartphones. In this paper, a highly scalable marketing system using Beacon and the smartphone applicationwas built to send push notifications to users based on the current location of customer inside the mall. Content was provided to people in order to increase sales. This work aims to demonstrate that the geomarketing system is able to detect the location of the customer, transmit the location's data via WIFI, display personalized promotions in a smartphone. The results show that implementation of Bluetooth Low Energy (BLE) technology in this system highly reduces the power consumption of the long-term monitoring system.

Capacitive Detection of Filling Levels in a Cup	2016 IEEE 13TH INTERNATIONAL CONFERENCE ON WEARABLE AND IMPLANTABLE BODY SENSOR NETWORKS (BSN)	International Conference on Wearable and Implantable Body Sensor Networks		English	Proceedings Paper	13th IEEE International Conference on Wearable and Implantable Body Sensor Networks (BSN)	JUN 14-17, 2016	San Francisco, CA	IEEE, EMB				This contribution presents a smart cup that uses a capacitive sensor to detect its filling level in order to monitor fluid intake over time. Dehydration is frequently diagnosed in hospitals among the elderly and connected to numerous sequelae and deaths. An automated monitoring system that detects daily fluid intake of a patient could reduce the vulnerability to dehydration and therefore the vast expenses that are associated with this condition. The smart cup obtains the current filling level from a capacitive sensor consisting of multiple serially arranged discrete electrodes. It is placed on the outside surface of its wall and shielded against external disturbances. Sensor data is processed applying multiple signal filters and error correction methods. Drinking volume of beverages at room temperature is detected accurately and reliably but error rate rises for very cold or hot liquids. The prototype integrates all components in a compact way, is dishwasher-safe and can be charged inductively. Data is transmitted to a base station via Bluetooth Low Energy. This way, a monitoring device is presented which will help preventing dehydration of elderly people.

Specifically, researchers and clinicians have proposed that impairments of low back posture and movement, particularly during functional activities, are important to address during intervention. However, objective measures of posture and movement are typically only measured in the laboratory setting. Observation of posture and movement in laboratory is limited because people with LBP may not perform naturally when they arc being observed, and observation in a single session does not provide information about the duration of postures or frequency of movements across the day. In this paper, we present a wireless body sensor cluster formed by up to seven sensors in order to monitor spine posture and movement both in absolute and relative coordinate systems. The Body Kinematics Monitoring (BKM) system measures the magnitude and frequency of spine movements, and duration of spine postures in 3D, without impeding natural movement. The BKM node developed in this study is 3.0cm in diameter, and contains a 9-axis motion processor that records the raw inertial information of different spine regions. The system offers a standard Bluetooth Low Energy (BLE) protocol to communicate with mobile or fixed hosts. The BKM system has been validated in the laboratory by measuring lumbar spine postures on a mechanical spine testing platform across a known range of angles.

Towards an Open Data Framework for Body Sensor Networks Supporting Bluetooth Low Energy	2016 IEEE 13TH INTERNATIONAL CONFERENCE ON WEARABLE AND IMPLANTABLE BODY SENSOR NETWORKS (BSN)	International Conference on Wearable and Implantable Body Sensor Networks		English	Proceedings Paper	13th IEEE International Conference on Wearable and Implantable Body Sensor Networks (BSN)	JUN 14-17, 2016	San Francisco, CA	IEEE, EMB				Major companies, healthcare professionals, the military, and other scientists and innovators are now sensing that fitness and health data from wearable biosensors will likely provide new discoveries and insights into physiological, cognitive, and emotional health status of an individual. Having the ability to collect, process, and correlate data simultaneously from a set of heterogonous biosensor sources may be a key factor in informing the development of new technologies for reducing health risks, improving health status, and possibly preventing and predicting disease. The challenge in achieving this is getting easy access to heterogeneous data from a set of disparate sensors in a single, integrated wearable monitoring system. Often times, the data recorded by commercial biosensing devices are contained within each manufacturer's proprietary platform. Summary data is available for some devices as free downloads or included only in annual premium memberships. Access to raw measurements is generally unavailable, especially from a custom developed application that may include prototype biosensors. In this paper, we explore key ideas on how to leverage the design features of Bluetooth Low Energy to ease the integration of disparate biosensors at the sensor communication layer. This component is intended to fit into a larger, multi-layered, open data framework that can provide additional data management and analytics capabilities for consumers and scientists alike at all the layers of a data access model which is typically employed in a body sensor network system.

A basic activity tracker has given many data on the user's movement to fulfill their daily goal of calories burned. An advance tracker can also measure heart rate with accurate activity intense level. However, consider if these fitness devices can be used for clinical diagnosis by adding an ECG, then it can be a daily health monitoring or a health assisted device by connecting it to the internet via a smartphone. To use an ECG as a wearable device, the electrode positions has to fulfill the clinical placement. A new biomedical electrodes placement is proposed in this paper to meet the practicality of a fitness lifestyle device but has a medical ECG result for continuous heart monitoring in a form of a necklace. The device has a single lead ECG analog front end that is connected to an ARM-Cortex M4 microcontroller. It uses a 4 GB memory card, rechargeable battery, and a Bluetooth Low Energy 4.0 to communicate with an Android 4.3 smartphone. The test results were taken from a 32-year-old male subject with normal heart condition. The signal acquired from the electrode placement at the backside of the neck shows Lead I waveform with 10% from the normal position amplitude value. The R-wave of every heartbeat can be seen for heart rate calculation. Therefore, it is able to do a daily heart monitoring with a lifestyle device.

One particular prototype has a multi-layer design since it is miniaturized by using an Electromagnetic Bandgap substrate operating in its slow-wave region. To design the patch antenna and EBG structure the dielectric properties of a fleece substrate is measured by utilizing ring resonator characterization method. Subsequently, the in-house fabricated textile patch antennas are employed in a wireless Bluetooth Low Energy (BLE) system for identification and monitoring human vital signs. Using TI's Bluetooth transceiver dongle with a personal laptop computer, and TI CC2540EM and SmartRF05EB boards as a transceiver tag, a communication distance of 17.69m was measured for a mere tag identification. This range is twice of what was obtained with a commercial dipole-type wire antenna. As well, when a vital sign sensor is added to BLE system with textile microstrip patch antenna successful remote measurement of human pulse rate was observed.

The implications of our manufacturing process is an antenna that can easily be applied to any surface, including epidermis, with full functionality after tuning of the antenna post manufacturing to its desired operational frequency. Both simulation and prototype measurements are in agreement. During testing, the antenna was mounted on a subject's biceps as the patient performed a stress test, demonstrating the desired antenna function as it was stretched, flexed and exposed to sweat. The antenna was tested at a functioning system level and was able to communicate via Bluetooth low energy (BLE) up to 150ft employing an iOS smart-phone application.

Furthermore, it is the foundation of a variety of services, such as indoor localization. We present a selective jammer against BLE beacons. The jammer selectively jams only BLE advertising beacons for which it was configured (API) on just the BLE advertising channels actually being used (narrowband). Such a jammer is hard to detect and hence requires a sophisticated Intrusion Detection System (IDS). The prototypic implementation uses off-the-shelf embedded hardware which is low-cost, small-size and very power efficient. Experiment results demonstrate the feasibility of the proposed solution and reveal the impact of the distance between jammer and receiver on the advertising success rate. At short distances the jammer is able to successfully corrupt all BLE advertisement beacon frames making the BLE beacon source undiscoverable.

Wi-Fi based services have been on rise, and Wi-Fi signals are omnipresent nowadays. Exploiting the feature of Wi-Fi signal detection from android smartphones, we built an app for user positioning in indoor environment. For testing purposes, we use pre-installed Wi-Fi access points and Beacon devices based on Bluetooth Low Energy (BLE) technology in our department for indoor positioning at the department. Using the classical RSSI based trilateration algorithm, we improved upon the location estimation using gradient descent over error function. We then analyze the results of location estimation with actual measurement of distances.

Recently, various indoor positioning methods, such as Wi-Fi, Bluetooth low energy (BLE), visible light communication, Japan's indoor messaging system, ultra-wide band (UWB), and pedestrian dead reckoning (PDR), have been investigated. The development of these technologies allows tracking of movement of both people and/or goods in indoor spaces, people and/or goods behavior analysis is expected as one of the key technologies for operation optimization. However, when we use these technologies for human tracking, there are some problem as follows. 1) Many cases need to use dedicated facilities (e.g. UWB). 2) When we use smartphone as sensing device, battery depletion is one of the big problem (especially using PDR). 3) the accuracy is instability for tracking (e.g. Wi-Fi). Based on these matters, in this study we designed and developed an indoor positioning system using BLE positioning. And, we adopted smartphone for business use as sensing device, developed a smartphone application runs on android OS. Moreover, we conducted the field test of developed system at Itoki Corporation's ITOKI Tokyo Innovation Center, SYNQA, office (Tokyo, Japan). Over 40 workers participated in this field test, and worker tracking log data were collected for 6 weeks. We analyzed the characteristics of the workers' behavior using this log data as a prototyping.

To enable adaptive behavior, a robot needs to recognize touch gestures and/or the proximity to interacting individuals. Moreover, a robot interacting with two or more humans usually needs to distinguish between them. However, this remains both a configuration and cost intensive task. In this paper we utilize inexpensive Bluetooth Low Energy (BLE) devices and propose an easy and configurable technique to enhance the robot's capabilities to interact with surrounding people. In a noisy laboratory setting, a mobile spherical robot is utilized in three proof-of-concept experiments of the proposed system architecture. Firstly, we enhance the robot with proximity information about the individuals in the surrounding environment. Secondly, we exploit BLE to utilize it as a touch sensor. And lastly, we use BLE to distinguish between interacting individuals. Results show that observing the raw received signal strength (RSS) between BLE devices already enhances the robot's interaction capabilities and that the provided infrastructure can be facilitated to enable adaptive behavior in the future. We show one and the same sensor system can be used to detect different types of information relevant in human- robot interaction (HRI) experiments.

Tele-monitoring is critical to alleviate this problem and recover from failures quickly. Energy conservation of such a tele-monitoring system is an important consideration. MATEMA6 enables us to monitor and notify the machine status with rapidly and low energy consumption. It is built on top of commodity technologies: a small board computer like Raspberry Pi, a low-power wireless protocol, and mobile phones. Raspberry Pi periodically gathers data from the machines through 6LoWPAN over Bluetooth Low Energy (BLE). The machine errors are notified immediately to the Android application on mobile phones. In addition, the employee can monitor their assigned machines; and the manager can see the overall performance of the factory via the Web browser either on the PC or the mobile phones. We also measure the energy consumption and show that the 6LoWPAN over BLE consumes only 45% and 76% of Wi-Fi and wired Ethernet, respectively.

The beacon signal can be broadcasted every certain interval. We collected data for line-of-sight (LOS) situation in in-room environment, and then recognize in-room presence according to path-loss readings. Data in other situations and environments such as obstructed-line-of-sight (OLOS) and outdoor scenario has been also considered to guarantee the in-room presence detection accuracy. Based on the empirical measurement results, we deeply investigate the system performance in terms of error detection possibility. This system is specifically promising for some particular purposes such as graduate seminar check-in, security system, in-and-out counting.

BLE is designed for ultra low power consumption, ideal for applications requiring episodic or periodic transfer of small amounts of data, such as tags for identification and tracking of assets. These tags are physical devices associated with the assets being tracked, which should be as small and light as possible for the widest applicability. Distance to the tag is of paramount importance in identifying the nearest tag when several tags are present. The method of measuring distances is based on Radio Signal Strength (RSS), which we've determined is not accurate when using BLE. The paper presents the methods being used to enhance the accuracy of distance reading using BLE.

Human body temperature and pulse value are measured by the detection circuit of Arduino, and these data are transferred to mobile devices via Bluetooth Low Energy (BLE). The application software based on Android system displays and stores these physiological parameter data. When the measured value is beyond the threshold, it would send warning information to the guardian and meanwhile send tips to the testee. The experimental results show that the system meets the requirements of real-time monitoring and recording of the human body physiological parameters, and alarms when it detects abnormal body temperature or pulse value.

Smartphones, equipped with wireless connectivity features and powerful processing capabilities, are usually utilized as a data aggregation, transmission and communication nodes. However, the main challenge of unobtrusive continuous sensing remains fast battery depletion of wireless sensor nodes and smartphones. In this paper, we have introduced wireless sensor network system with multimodal platform for physiological monitoring and smartphone for subsequent processing. Possible distribution of processing operations for wireless sensor node and smartphone device is demonstrated in stress detection scenario. Event-driven approach based on Bluetooth Low Energy communication protocol for data transfer between sensor board and smartphone shows significant savings in power consumption, while maintaining satisfying level of accuracy. This proves to be of high importance, in order to improve systems reliability and user acceptance in other real-time health monitoring scenarios.

To achieve this, a demonstrator application is used in multiple measurements to analyze the packet delivery ratio of different setups. Since no official mesh implementation for Bluetooth Low Energy (BLE) has been released to this date, the proprietary, BLE-based CSRmesh protocol is used in this study. Besides the measurement campaign, several simulations were performed in order to study the suitability of Bluetooth Mesh in large-scale networks. Our results show that Bluetooth Mesh is a promising technology for mesh applications but additional effort is required during the ongoing standardization process to exploit its full potential.

In order to realize the indoor positioning with these communication systems, techniques such as fingerprinting, trilateration, and triangulation have been widely studied. Even though fingerprinting has been chosen as a representative approach in many literatures, it is known as tedious and time consuming method due to the long-time location learning phase. Therefore, the fingerprinting is expected to be integrated with other methods to enhance the location accuracy and reduce the location estimation procedures. In this work, we discuss one of these methods used for indoor positioning, i.e., weighted centroid localization (WCL) using received signal strength indicator (RSSI) observed from neighboring BLE beacons. The WCL is evaluated in our testbed building and analyzed to configure its parameters for indoor positioning.

Micro-localization refers to the phenomena of tracking a target with high accuracy, which is an integral part of location-aware applications, both indoor and outdoor. Although many approaches towards localization have already been proposed in many research works, Received Signal Strength Identification (RSSI) based localization using the latest BLE technology is comparatively a new concept and it reduces the energy requirements of such applications. But RSSI based distance calculation provide only a rough estimation of the proximity and does not give an accurate result for micro-localization. This paper presents and evaluates a computationally simple method for micro-localization of an object from the RSSI values from a collection of iBeacons so the method can be used in devices with very low processing power. Among the different scenarios the experiments were conducted, most of them resulted in localization error of less than 1m.

The technology is continuously improving and it is now possible for consumers to buy highly durable beacons for a reasonable price. The main use of these beacons is to be harnessed by context-aware software, as such, applications requiring localization can benefit from beacon technology. However, the reliability and accuracy of the location information is rather crucial when used for ambient intelligence in healthcare domain. Most systems currently rely only on received signal strength indication (RSSI) that may not be highly reliable in that they are highly susceptible to diffraction, multipath propagation, angle-of-arrival, lack of line-of-sight and absorption by human body. In this paper, we propose to investigate the use of two features in addition to mean RSSI. The new algorithm presented in the paper improve the localization accuracy from 6.2% to 9.14% over simple proximity localization.

Their low cost and robustness make them a fit choice for ambient assisted living or other healthcare applications. Nevertheless, similar to many other radio-frequency based technologies, beacons pose serious challenges when it comes to developing applications that require predictability. Moreover, the multipath propagation characteristics of Bluetooth beacons prevent ambient intelligent researchers to solely rely on using theoretical models to describe their behaviors. In this paper, we present an empirical evaluation of Bluetooth beacons behaviors. We describe the observed pattern of the signal through a series of experiments totalizing more than 3 million samples.

We could determine the degree of familiarity by using personal information gleaned from a social networking service. For a real-time service, we usually use video data. Unfortunately, this data is closely related to a user's privacy, so the user may feel uncomfortable about its use. Therefore, in this study, we set out to devise a real-time familiarity analysis model using a minimal amount of information and a Bluetooth low-energy beacon. Unlike the traditional approach, the devices receiving the beacon signal are placed on a desk, wall, or ceiling and the user carries a beacon. The beacon transmits only its ID and a received signal strength indication (RSSI) signal. Using the device for receiving the beacon signal, a user's location can be monitored so that the server can analyze the intragroup and calculate the degree of familiarity between users. This study addressed those situations arising in a party-like event, in a school, in a company, etc. to attempt to analyze the degree of familiarity by determining a person's location at specific times. This technology could also be applied to exhibitions, parks, and amusement parks to determine the most popular exhibits, spots, and facilities in real time.

According to the iBeacon protocol, iBeacon transmitters only do one-way broadcast communication, and thus it is difficult to authenticate the legitimacy of the transmitters. In this paper, we focus on detecting the physical attacks against iBeacon transmitters-iBeacon transmitters can be stolen, tampered, faked and reused, which interfere with the legitimate iBeacon transmission, reduce the quality of service and ultimately degrade the user experience. We develop a detection system based on Hidden Markov Model running on the server-side to detect the misbehaving iBeacon transmitters without more energy consuming. Our system achieves 85% detection accuracy on average for all physical attack actions; meanwhile it has a 5 % false alarm rate for non-attack situations in our designated trace experiments, and 100 % correct binary judgements in the random-trace experiments. To the best of our knowledge, this is the first work that focuses on the iBeacon physical attack problem.

Continuous heart rate monitoring with clinical accuracy using reflectance photoplethysmogram signals from wrist is highly challenging and presents a potential area of research. In this work, we present a wearable device in a wrist watch form factor for heart rate monitoring. The device runs on a low power ARM cortex M4 microcontroller and integrates a BLE (Bluetooth Low energy) module for wireless connectivity. A heart rate computation algorithm using reflectance photoplethysmography and a 3 axes accelerometer for motion artifact removal is presented in the paper. Heart rate computed by the wrist worn device was validated against heart rate measured using Masimo Radical-7 on 256 subjects. The validation study was conducted in a hospital setting for a duration of 1 month, after obtaining the ethics committee approval and informed consent from the subjects. Details of the experimental setup, clinical validation protocol and observations and inferences made from the study are presented.	[Preejith, S.

Ranging algorithms for positioning rely on the accuracy of the parameters of the propagation model. This model is used to infer an estimate of the distance of a mobile device from each access point from the Received Signal Strength Indication (RSSI). In this work we present an algorithm which dynamically recalculates and improves the propagation model. The improvement of the model parameters fits the environment's characteristics and, more importantly, the reception characteristics of the device used. The proposed algorithm is tested with different devices at an indoor deployment covering a large area where Bluetooth Low Energy (BLE) technology is used. The experimental results show that the proposed method offers a significant accuracy improvement to some devices while it slightly improves the performance of those that are more properly tuned.

The system exploits easily available building floor maps in raster form, with an easy conversion to vector model, eliminating the need of specially designed vector maps, thereby making the system scalable for large indoor maps and more implementation friendly. This also enables the vector map to be used in both Particle Filter based IMU tracking, and routing. Additionally, an efficient method for independent fusion of location information from phone IMU sensors and Bluetooth Low Energy (BLE) beacons is demonstrated. The method caters both dynamic and static properties of the system state. Furthermore, the paper proposes a novel approach for estimating the distance from BLE beacons using RSSI (Received Signal Strength Indication) measurement. InLoc can be readily used for any size of building floors for applications like tracking, routing and guiding system, emergency evacuation, meeting planners etc. requiring no separate effort to rebuild the vector map from scratch. The system yields a mean tracking error of less than 0.4m in location, and yields 0.9m as an average positioning error using fusion.

In this article we show how this effort can be reduced by automating the configuration of new wireless devices, based on their location. This technique is useful in e.g. home automation systems where a light switch needs to be paired with the light fixtures. To show how our system works, we have implemented a demonstrator application based on Bluetooth Low Energy. We assume that each room contains a beacon node that holds the settings for that room. Based on the RSSI in the BLE advertisements of those node, a new node can detect in which room it is deployed and update its own settings accordingly. A node can do this correctly in 96% of the case. To improve the reliability, a node can ask the user to confirm its position, whenever there is doubt. This happens in 12% of the cases, resulting in 100% correct localizations.

Our objective is to accurately determine which product sections a user is adjacent to while traversing the store, using RSSI readings from multiple beacons, measured asynchronously on a standard commercial mobile device. We further wish to leverage the store layout (which imposes natural constraints on the movement of users) and the physical configuration of the beacon network, to produce a robust and efficient solution. We introduce our node-graph model of user location, which is designed to represent the location layout. We also present our experimental work which includes an investigation of signal characteristics along and across aisles. We propose three methods of localization, using a "nearest-beacon" approach as a base-line; exponentially averaged weighted range estimates; and a particle-filter method based on the RSSI attenuation model and Gaussian-noise. Our results demonstrate that the particle filter method significantly out-performs the others. Scalability also makes this method ideal for applications run on mobile devices with more limited computational capabilities.

However, the initial creation and subsequent maintenance of the signal maps remains a challenge since traditional manual surveying is not scalable. In this work we look at the use of path surveys, which attempt to construct the signal maps from a sparse set of fingerprints collected while a person walks through a space. As such, the survey points rarely provide a uniform coverage of the space of interest. We quantitatively evaluate path surveys with reference to a detailed manual survey using smartphone-grade equipment. We compare both the individual maps (generated using Gaussian Process regression) and their collective positioning performance. Our results are for both WiFi and Bluetooth Low Energy signals. We show that a path survey can provide maps of equivalent quality to a manual survey if a series of guidelines we provide are followed.

The proposed system is assumed to be used in disaster situation where the Internet connection is not available. It means that a smartphone cannot obtain any information as well as any new application because all the applications are distributed in the cloud such as App Store. However, our proposed system is equipped with the mechanism, called RecurShare, to distribute the applications on-site. In addition, our proposed system has the function to solve "Central-Peripheral problem" which stems from BLE hardware. Generally, a smartphone works as "Central" of BLE connection, and the connection between Centrals cannot be established. Therefore, it is not easy to realize a BLE-based ad-hoc communication system between smartphones except iPhone. Our proposed function utilizes a few peripheral-ready terminal as a router of the network for solving this problem. To evaluate the feasibility of our proposed system, we show that the proposed system can replicate the application on-site and also enable chat among Android smartphones even if some of them are Central-only terminal.

This demands that construction professionals be more effective and organized to successfully complete their construction activities. However, recent research shows that current construction management techniques are ineffective. In addition, this research recognized the potential benefits of location awareness of construction resources in the construction management. The availability of location awareness information was identified to assist real-time decision making, provide more control over construction processes, and improve productivity and safety. In this context, this paper introduces an indoor location tracking system that integrates Bluetooth low energy (BLE) sensors and motion sensors with BIM. BLE Beacons were used to track a target by estimating its location. Motion sensors were used to enhance the quality of estimation. In addition, a BIM model was exploited to extract map knowledge for movement constraints. Two field tests were conducted at two indoor construction sites. Complex tracking scenarios were designed to thoroughly assess accuracy and reliability of the tracking system. The results demonstrated the capability of the proposed tracking system with an average accuracy of about 1 similar to 2 m, which indicated that the implementation of the BLE tracking system in construction applications would be effective and promising for potential widespread adoption.

Common methods utilize Wi-Fi signals. However, most of the Wi-Fi, because it is pre-installed for other purposes, is difficult to fully used for fingerprinting. Bluetooth beacon fingerprinting (BBF) can be used to overcome the drawbacks of the Wi-Fi fingerprinting. With BBF cost reduction is possible, and it also has advantages that can flexibly correspond to the environment variation. This study determines whether it is possible to achieve IPS with implementation of BLE beacon-based fingerprinting. This study presents an optimized fingerprinting method for building a fingerprinting data. In order to increase the accuracy, we applied filtering and probabilistic smoothing technique of fluctuation correction to necessary part of the signal. Result of the study proposes that BLE beacon fingerprinting can be a replacement for Wi-Fi based fingerprinting.

We design a patch-based image encoding algorithm to produce encoded images of reasonably high quality, having sizes of as low as 16 bytes - without any prior knowledge of the test images. We test our system with different types of images that contain hand-written alphanumeric characters, geometric shapes, and arbitrary binary images having complex shapes and curves. We empirically determine the tradeoffs between the system lifetime and the quality of broadcasted images, and determine an optimal set of parameters for our system, under user-specified constraints such as the number of available beacon devices, maximum latency, and life expectancy. We develop a smartphone application that takes an image and user-requirements as inputs, shows previews of different quality output images, writes the encoded image into a set of beacons, and reads the broadcasted image back. Our evaluation shows that a set of 2-3 beacons is capable of broadcasting high-quality images (75%-90% structurally similar to original images) for a year-long continuous broadcasting, and both the lifetime and the image quality improve when more beacons are used.

In the field of wireless sensor net, to apply low-power consumption Bluetooth could decrease the cost of system and reduce the devices' volume, especially lower the power consumption. Based on Bluetooth Low Energy, this paper proposes a wireless sensor net integrate program and designs a key node in the wireless sensor net to reduce the node's volume and decrease the energy consumption. Through testing we found that the system could transfer the data which were collected by the sensors to the node by low-energy consumption Bluetooth. Due to its low cost and easy operation, the system is suitably applied to rigid monitoring systems such as military, industry, medical treatment, agriculture or life.

For those applications several methods can be used, such as a Global Navigation Satellite System (GNSS) or a wireless localization system. In this paper a topological map is used to implement a indoor localization system for smartphone users. Benefit of this kind of map is that the position is reduced to one dimension, which simplifies the localization process in a considerable way. The map consists of vertices, which could be important points such as crossings or a ending point of a path, and edges, which represent ways between the vertices. The localization process utilizes different sensors of the smartphone, such as the accelerometer, the pressure sensor, Bluetooth Low Energy (BLE) and the integrated rotation sensor. To combine all of these information an Extended Kalman Filter (EKF) is introduced. To overcome crucial sensor information and thus to increase the robustness of the localization a multi hypotheses approach is implemented. Here different possible user positions on the topological map are instantiated and weighted. The implemented Kalman Filter is evaluated in several experiments which are recorded in an office building.

This paper talks about our experiences with iBeacon and establishing its effectiveness in indoor positioning. We placed multiple beacons in a room and recorded received signal strength (RSSI) at designated points (fingerprinting) to create a RSSI fingerprint database. This was used to establish location of a user in real time based on the measured RSSI in the user's mobile device. We found beacon signal strength is inconsistent and is dependent on height, position, direction of device and obstacles. RSSI fingerprinting is time consuming and must be redone if beacons are moved or if room is rearranged. Our conclusion was that iBeacon was more suitable for applications around proximity rather than positioning.	[Deepesh, P.

It is characterized by low costs, high energy efficiency and low intrusiveness to increase the acceptance of the users. Activity recognition is performed locally on a single small-sized wearable device incorporating a microprocessor and a tri-axial accelerometer. After investigating on different feature sets and classification algorithms, the final implementation only considers five time domain features and a C4.5 decision tree classifier resulting in an immediate response. This wearable device is successfully integrated into an intelligent environment by Bluetooth Low Energy wireless communication protocol and openHAB as platform-independent integration software. The integration of the system into the home environment allows reactions of the home depending on the activity which enriches the life quality of the residents. Additionally, the system covers fall detection that enables the home to provide a fallen person with urgent support.

Oftentimes, when subscribers experience frustratingly high network delays and timeouts, they like to know whether their experiences are shared by other users nearby. The question that is often asked is essentially this: "is it just me, or do others around me face the same problem?" In this paper, we describe how we use Tattle, a distributed real-time participatory sensing and monitoring framework, to glean network performance information from users nearby. Tattle relies on recent advances in peer-to-peer device networking, such as WiFi Direct, Bluetooth Low Energy, and Apple's iBeacon, to exchange key snippets of diagnostic information using very low-power, very short-range local-area wireless interfaces, between participating devices. We propose and develop a robust statistical algorithm, based on quantile regression, which identifies key points in time where a device experiences high delays and outages that are not observed by its neighbors, and decides if the device is performing "normally", or "abnormally". This directly answers the "me, or others?" question. We demonstrate and validate the efficacy of our system through real-world measurements of network delay, consisting of over 7,300 time-series that comprises over 443,500 data samples, using commodity smart devices attached to two different providers' networks.

As the IoT ecosystems continues mature, new devices and protocols are being developed. Our team is specifically interested in Bluetooth Low Energy (BLE) IoT beacons. As BLE beacons become more popular and widely adopted, interesting use cases have been developed. For example, Location-Based Systems that use BLE beacon technology to help smartphone users navigate through buildings. In this paper, we will provide examples of what has been done with BLE beacons, and an overview of a work-in-progress prototype that leverages BLE beacons. Our prototype, BeaSmart, is a mobile application that is being deployed and tested in the IBM Almaden Research Center (ARC). The BeaSmart application has four features that provide a more contextualized experience for employees and visitors as they navigate through ARC. We plan to use BeaSmart as a tool to evaluate the technical and human factors to consider when making a building smarter with BLE Beacons.

In this paper, we propose a new BLE-based fingerprinting localization scheme that improves localization accuracy. BLE is a narrow band communication that is highly affected by frequency selective fading and channel gains. We employ channel-specific features to location fingerprint to improve localization accuracy. Current BLE standards provide no API to retrieve an advertising channel number. We therefore developed a separate channel advertising scheme to measure RSS (Received Signal Strength) on each advertising channel. To demonstrate the feasibility of the separate channel fingerprinting, we conducted initial evaluations. Experimental evaluations showed that the separate channel fingerprinting improves accuracy by approximately 12 %.

The real time simulator is a simulation using the data collected in real time, which is effective in reduce prediction error and support quick decision making. Because of a high analytical cost in the conventional work measurement, it is difficult to continuously collect workers' position and motion data of the cellular manufacturing system in real time. For this purpose, we built an experimental cellular manufacturing line that is able to easily collect the data in real time using the Bluetooth low energy beacons. Next, we analyzed the collected data to extract production cycle time of each product. Finally, we constructed a real time simulation to combine the analyzed workers' position data and a discrete event simulation. The results of the real time measurement with BLE beacons have revealed that, the method is as good as the video camera analysis, but it has a few failures to extract the start of the production cycle time. The results of the real time simulation were able to decrease the prediction error than using the standard work time.

To alleviate this problem different data collection approaches have been proposed. One of the promising techniques is to use unmanned aerial vehicle (UAV). In spite of several papers advocating this approach, there have been no system designs and associated performance evaluation proposed to date. In this paper, we address this issue by proposing a new WSN design, where UAV serves as a sink while Bluetooth low energy (BLE) is used as a communication technology. We analyze the proposed design in terms of the network lifetime and area coverage comparing it with routed WSNs. Our results reveal that the lifetime of the proposed design is approximately two orders of magnitude longer than that of the routed WSNs. Using the tools of integral geometry we show that the density of nodes to cover a certain area is approximately two times more for routed WSNs compared to our design.

While the majority of existing solutions suggest a wireless key to be a battery-powered device with considerable computational power, we propose to use passive NFC tags instead. In our approach, all the computations are performed by the service the user is authenticating to and thus no computational power and no battery on the key side is required. This approach allows minimizing the device size and significantly reducing the costs. To ensure security of data stored on the tag we propose a transparent data encryption mechanism constructed on top of strong cryptographic primitives. In addition to the authentication-related feature, we have designed a system that enables secure storage of documents on the same tag making it capable of saving ID cards, bank cards, licenses, etc. The presented approach allows on-the-fly validation of any stored document by the entity that issued it as well as by any other entity granted such permissions. Correctness and a security level of the system have been assessed via the analytical study and validated through a hardware prototype. The algorithms and protocols described in the paper are also applicable to any other carrier technology including Bluetooth Low Energy and Wireless USB.

A generic wireless debugging infrastructure over Bluetooth Low Energy (BLE) is proposed. We show how it is possible to balance the conflicting needs of security and visibility in a coherent framework based on leveraging an Android-powered device with protocol stack access. The concept of "virtual fuses" is employed that allows selective access to the debug interface based on trust at stages starting from individual node development to the deployment and update of the system. The debug and security needs are solved with suitable trust management which allows selective activation or deactivation of debug resources throughout the system life. Lastly, the proposed system is implemented in a practical experiment.

Bluetooth Low Energy Beacons, small radio frequency broadcasters that advertise their unique identification, have been highlighted for their possible usage in the IoT infrastructure, as a sensor network of BLE Beacons is capable of providing contextual and locational information to the users. However, as the size of the wireless sensor network has grown, finite battery capacity has proven to be a major challenge. Due to the limited battery capacity, Beacons require periodic maintenance and battery replacement, which results in increased beacon management cost and complexity. This paper attempts to remedy this problem through the integration of an energy harvesting mechanism with BLE Beacons, and explore the possibilities of using solar power to operate these devices. Experimental results for BLE Beacon power consumption and solar panel power output characteristics are presented, and therefore baseline parameters of the power requirements for sustainable BLE Beacons are established. Furthermore, a preliminary design of a solarpowered BLE Beacon is presented. It has been shown that a typical BLE Beacon with a transmission power of 0 dbm and advertising interval of 800 ms can be powered by a solar panel with surface area of 300 cm(2), and a lithium ion rechargeable coin cell battery, LIR2450, with a nominal voltage of 3.6 V can be recharged by a solar panel with a surface area of 88 cm(2).

In IoT, BLE gateways should discover surrounding BLE devices in a short time. However, this requirement is difficult to achieve when the number of BLE devices is very large. As the number of BLE devices increase, the signal density increase, and the collision problems become more serious. In this paper, we analyze the performance of BLE by considering both signal collision and density. The simulation results show that there exists the optimal AdvInterval for given number of BLE devices.

According to IBM report, the patient-centric healthcare devices should be continuously accessible through the Internet. In this respect, Bluetooth Low Energy (BLE) is widely used as a last mile communication connecting healthcare devices to the Internet through a smartphone thanks to its long life time and lightweightness. Since the BLE does not support Internet connectivity by itself, BLE devices always need paring with the smartphone. However, if the smart phone is dead, the BLE based healthcare devices cannot access to the Internet and notify emergency data to medical center. This may threaten the life of the patient. In this paper, we propose the BLE platform suitable for the patient-centric healthcare service. We design an adaptive network platform to provide the Internet connectivity for the BLE based patient-centric healthcare devices. The platform includes two key features, (1) applying IETF 6Lo standard to enable the Internet connectivity, and (2) design of Advertising Data Transmission Protocol for ensuring emergency data transmission. By using raspberry pi and CC2540 dongle, we have implemented the prototype of the IPv6 over BLE (6BLE) platform and conducted the experiment.

We also give the positioning procedure and the system construction in detail, including deploying massive Bluetooth beacons in vast indoor area, using smart phone and cloud server to collect and calculate Bluetooth data respectively, and presenting results on a smart phone. We have tested it in two scenes using several methods, and field test results show that we have got a relatively accurate result (1.58 meters), which indicates a practical solution to "the last mile" problem.

Recently, the IoT-based healthcare services are considered as one of the crucial services. However, the existing IoT technology, such as Bluetooth and ISO/IEEE 11073 standard, is not suitable for providing IoT-based healthcare services because it does not support the Internet Protocol (IP). Moreover, the oneM2M standard does not support the IoT-based healthcare services. In this paper, we propose a new architecture of ISO/IEEE 11073-based IoT healthcare services. The proposed architecture can support IP communication using IPv6 over Low power Wireless Personal Area Networks (6LoWPAN) technology in the Bluetooth Low Energy (BLE) network. We also use the Constrained Application Protocol (CoAP) to provide more efficient communication for constrained devices. For validation of the proposed architecture, we implemented the ISO/IEEE 11073-based healthcare services using 6LoWPAN and BLE. We also performed testbed experimentation. In addition, for evaluation of the associated protocols, we compare the transmission delay between CoAP and HTTP. From the results, we see that CoAP is more efficient than HTTP for the IoT healthcare services.

An IoT-based Occupational Safety Management System in Cold Storage Facilities	Proceedings of the 6th International Workshop of Advanced Manufacturing and Automation	AEBMR-Advances in Economics Business and Management Research		English	Proceedings Paper	6th International Workshop of Advanced Manufacturing and Automation (IWAMA)	NOV 10-11, 2016	Univ Manchester, Manchester, ENGLAND	Norwegian Univ Sci & Technol, Shanghai Polytechn Univ, SHU, NTNU, SFI Norman	Univ Manchester	Occupational safety; Internet of Things; Bluetooth Low Energy; Fuzzy logic; Cold chain logistics	OPERATIONS; LOGISTICS; HEALTH	In the contemporary strategy of cold chain logistics, cold storage plays an important role to keep the inventory under the extreme environmental conditions. As the demand of cold storage services is growing rapidly nowadays, attention paid on occupational safety of warehouse workers is increasing under extreme working environment. Traditionally, the safety of workers are assessed by their experience and personal judgement. Without automatic data capturing tools, it is hard to monitor the actual health status of workers who may be dangerous when working too long in the cold storage facilities. In addition, there is a lack of prompt signal to managers and first-aid teams for instant treatment when the workers get cold injuries or illnesses. Therefore, the real-time health monitoring and positioning of the workers are in need. Nowadays, Internet of Things (IoT) is a mean of real-time interconnection system in which target objects are equipped with the identifying and sensing technologies. This paper presents an IoT-based occupational safety management system (IoT-OSMS) by using the identifying and sensing techniques to locate workers' positions and to guarantee the occupational safety. Bluetooth Low Energy (BLE), a kind of Radio Frequency Identification (RFID) solutions, is used to locate and collect the information of the workers inside the cold storage facilities. The workers' locations are calculated by using Trilateration with Taylor's series adjustment and Kalman filter. On the other hand, fuzzy logic technique is used to examine and generate the customized cold stress and monitoring review cycle. By integrating the positioning and Fuzzy logic approaches seamlessly, it is found that the occupational safety of warehouse workers can be guaranteed and monitored in the real-time situation.

These devices are battery powered since they may be used even to monitor hazardous events in inaccessible areas. As a consequence, it is preferable to assure the adoption of energy management solutions in order to extend the WSN lifetime, as far as possible. Moreover, it is crucial to guarantee that the nodes receive the transmitted data correctly. It is clear that trading off power optimization and quality of service has become one the most important concerns when dealing with modern systems based on WSNs. This paper introduces a solution based on a Fuzzy Logic Controller (FLC) focusing on the minimization of energy consumption of wireless sensor nodes. This is made possible because the sleeping time of these nodes is dynamically regulated by a FLC.

By combining tag localization with its identification capability, new features can be associated with each detected object, extending the set of potential applications. The main problem consists in the association between wireless tags and objects due to the intrinsic limitations of Received Signal Strength Indicator-based localization approaches. In this paper, an experimental comparison between two specific technologies is presented: passive UHF Radio Frequency IDentification (RFID) and Bluetooth Low Energy (BLE). An automatic calibration process is used to model the relationship between RSSI and distance values. A robust data association method is presented to deal with complex outdoor scenarios in medium sized areas with a measurement range up to 15m. The proposed approach is validated in crosswalks with pedestrians wearing portable RFID passive tags and active BLE beacons.	[Llorca, D.

The work focuses on how mesh networks can be established using Bluetooth Low Energy exploiting the heterogeneous characteristics of the devices in the network. A novel algorithm called Topology Formation considering Role Suitability (TFRS) is proposed aiming to maximize the network lifetime. The algorithm employs a newly introduced metric called role suitability metric (RSM) to assign the best role among master, relay and slave to a participating device. The RSM metric is computed from device characteristics including, but not limited to, energy, mobility and computational capability. We use system-level simulation to evaluate the performance of the proposed algorithm against a reference under a homogeneous deployment scenario consisting of heterogeneous devices. Results show that the network lifetime can be improved significantly when the topology is formed considering the device characteristics for both master role selection and relay selection. TFRS can achieve 20% to 40% higher network lifetime depending on the deployment characteristics over the reference algorithm.

Evaluating Bluetooth Low Energy in Realistic Wireless Environments	2016 IEEE WIRELESS COMMUNICATIONS AND NETWORKING CONFERENCE	IEEE Wireless Communications and Networking Conference		English	Proceedings Paper	IEEE Wireless Communications and Networking Conference (WCNC)	APR 03-06, 2016	Doha, QATAR	IEEE, IEEE Commun Soc				The 2.4 GHz ISM band is crowded with a wide variety of wireless devices operating under various access protocols, Bluetooth Low Energy (BLE) among them. Low power requirements, low cost, and ease of integration have promoted BLE's rapidly growing popularity. BLE applications range from providing wireless interface for monitoring household equipment status to reporting critical information from medical devices that might have less tolerance for transmission errors to function properly. In this paper, we identify risks in a real world wireless environment that adversely affect BLE system functionality. We also propose a methodology utilizing spectrum surveys to quantify probability of transmission failure relative to the system's interference detection threshold. Spectrum surveys were conducted in a basketball sport facility, a university student union and a hospital intensive care unit (ICU). Results demonstrate how a BLE system selects data transmission channels in the presence of interference. Moreover, findings of this study confirm that a BLE system is able to maintain a low probability of failed transmission while operating in the presence of high interference unless the environment noise floor is close to the employed interference detection threshold.

They are often difficult to fill in and might have only a limited value since users' context is often either missing or tedious to be entered manually. Research has shown that simplifying the forms and enriching them with contextual information can improve the quality and quantity of user feedback. We propose a context-aware survey approach by monitoring the user context with Bluetooth Low Energy devices. We implemented and evaluated a prototype that infers the location and usage context and adapts the feedback forms accordingly. (C) 2016 The Authors. Published by Elsevier B.V.

In this paper, we describe the Bluetooth-based wireless protocol and interaction concept on which CalendarCast is based, present a prototypical implementation with Android smartphones and dedicated beacons, and report on results of a user study demonstrating improved task performance compared to unaugmented calendars. The motivating scenario for CalendarCast occurs quite often in a variety of contexts, for example at the end of a prior meeting or during ad-hoc conversations in the hallway. Despite a large variety of digital calendar tools, this situation still usually involves a lengthy manual comparison of free and busy time slots. CalendarCast utilizes Bluetooth Low Energy (BTLE) advertisement broadcasts to share the required free/busy information with a limited, localized audience, on demand only, and without revealing detailed personal information. No prior knowledge about the other participants, such as email addresses or account names, is required.

This technology has become even more important with the advent of the Internet of Things: each node acquires an IPv6 address and can be directly accessed from remote when the switch from IPv4 to IPv6 will take place. Such systems are actually applied in environment monitoring, home automation, industry, and lot of other fields. The Ambient Assisted Living scenery is a perfect field of application for sensor networks based on the IP protocol. The monitoring of elderly people, the automation of home appliances and the assistance to the person can be easily achieved through a network based on IPv6. Furthermore, such a system allows to obtain a maximum interoperability with existent networks, avoiding the need for inconvenient gateways to interface systems with different communication protocols. The presented work describes a complete hardware and software system able to solve the interoperability issue among Smart Home and Ambient Assisted Living. Sub GHz frequency, mesh topology and low power consumption give a competitive advantage to the system against Bluetooth Low Energy or ZigBee technology.

As widely supported by wearable devices, BLE has the potential to become an alternative for indoor-localization and proximity sensing. The aim of this work was to perform a thorough characterization of the RSSI-distance relationship under controlled conditions using two BLE devices. Four calibration models underwent to a comparative evaluation analysis. The best results were obtained using a polynomial model with a mean distance percentage error equal to 25.7% (0.4 m) in the range 0-3 m. An overall improvement of 14.3% (0.24 m) in the distance estimate compared to the exponential model commonly adopted in the literature was reported.

In this paper, a positioning algorithm using Bluetooth Low Energy RSSI is proposed for indoor application. First in our algorithm, RSSI value is pre-processed: outliers of RSSI are removed, and moving average of RSSI is calculated. Then distance is determined using pre-processed RSSI and Kalman filtering. Finally, a triangulation algorithm is used to calculate the current location of the mobile device. Experiment results show that our algorithm achieves positioning accuracy of 0.2 similar to 0.5m.

In this paper, an Ambient Assisted Living (AAL) system has been designed in order to create better living conditions for older people. In this way, people can live independently longer in their own house with an improved quality of life. The proposed system includes several features. On the one hand, it is able to continuously monitor the health status of the elderly through data coming from heterogeneous sources (i.e., environmental sensors and medical devices). On the other hand, it is able to guarantee outdoor and indoor localization aimed to know the real-time position of the elderly both inside and outside their home. A remote reasoning system processes all collected data with the aim of generating appropriate events and alerts.

The wireless communication with the master computer allow slaves to be added, replaced or removed without the need for rewiring. Dependability can be increased as implementation of redundancy, both for masters and slaves, does not require wired connections between them. This concept has been utilized in an industrial prototype and evaluated in an experiment presented in this paper. The experiment evaluated the communication latency with Bluetooth Low Energy, compared to a wired alternative, which is important for reliable operation. The results showed a similar average latency, but the worst case was less favorable for Bluetooth Low Energy. However, since the slaves are intended to manage time critical operations locally, with the master computer in a supervisory role, these delays will be acceptable in many applications, when considering the advantages of a wireless master-slave communication.

While discovery protocols like Multicast DNS, Apple AirDrop, and Bluetooth Low Energy have gained widespread adoption across both IoT and mobile devices, most of these protocols do not offer any form of privacy control for the service, and often leak sensitive information such as service type, device hostname, device owner's identity, and more in the clear. To address the need for better privacy in both the IoT and the mobile landscape, we develop two protocols for private service discovery and private mutual authentication. Our protocols provide private and authentic service advertisements, zero round-trip (0-RTT) mutual authentication, and are provably secure in the Canetti-Krawczyk key-exchange model. In contrast to alternatives, our protocols are lightweight and require minimal modification to existing key-exchange protocols. We integrate our protocols into an existing open-source distributed applications framework, and provide benchmarks on multiple hardware platforms: Intel Edisons, Raspberry Pis, smartphones, laptops, and desktops. Finally, we discuss some privacy limitations of the Apple AirDrop protocol (a peer-to-peer file sharing mechanism) and show how to improve the privacy of Apple AirDrop using our private mutual authentication protocol.

These fitness trackers predominantly use Bluetooth Low Energy (BLE) for communicating and syncing the data with user's smartphone. This paper presents a measurement-driven study of possible privacy leakage from BLE communication between the fitness tracker and the smartphone. Using real BLE traffic traces collected in the wild and in controlled experiments, we show that majority of the fitness trackers use unchanged BLE address while advertising, making it feasible to track them. The BLE traffic of the fitness trackers is found to be correlated with the intensity of user's activity, making it possible for an eavesdropper to determine user's current activity (walking, sitting, idle or running) through BLE traffic analysis. Furthermore, we also demonstrate that the BLE traffic can represent user's gait which is known to be distinct from user to user. This makes it possible to identify a person (from a small group of users) based on the BLE traffic of her fitness tracker. As BLE-based wearable fitness trackers become widely adopted, our aim is to identify important privacy implications of their usage and discuss prevention strategies.

A beacon application in users smartphone connects an offline physical beacon with an online service produced by a service provider. However, since the BLE beacon separately operates by each service provider, users need to run multiple providers applications to access different providers service. This leads to much energy and resource consumption which potentially hinders other common uses of the smartphone. In this paper, we proposed GS1beacon, a GS1 standard based integrated BLE beacon service platform which could find the desired service regardless of providers applications, and provide multiple services in a single BLE beacon. To realize this, we construct a global discovery system by using an Object Name Service (ONS) and unify format of a BLE beacon ID by using a GS1 ID keys. Additionally, we prototyped GS1beacon service platform and showed its feasibility through case study, and performance evaluation.

We derive the analytical expressions for the performances of differential inductively-degenerated common-source (CS) LNA and cross-coupled common-gate (CG) LNA with on-chip transformers to present their design considerations. The derived expressions provide the minimum requirement for the quality factor of the inductor and the optimum inductance for the minimum noise figure (NF) of the LNA. Both the LNAs with inter-winding symmetric octagonal transformers are designed for Bluetooth Low Energy (BLE) receivers with a 65-nm CMOS process. Simulations show that the differential CS and CG LNAs achieve vertical bar S-21 vertical bar of 20.4 dB and 20.9 dB, and N F of 5.18 dB and 4.55 dB at 2.45 GHz, respectively, with a power consumption of 2.8 mW from a 0.7-V supply. The CG LNA can achieve a higher gain and lower NF than the CS one. The presented analysis and design considerations significantly reduce the design efforts to differential LNAs with on-chip transformers.

To achieve low power, QVCO, LNA and split trans-conductance amplifier (TCA)s are sharing bias current in the first stage. Similarly, trans impedance amplifier (TIA) and 3rd order LPF sharing the second stage bias current. The use of split TCAs avoiding I/Q cross talk even with 50% local oscillator (LO) signal and a current driven passive mixer down converting single ended RF signal into differential base band signal without the use of RF balun. The programmable LPF enables the receiver to operate in both ZigBee and BLE modes. Optimum input matching is achieved independent of bond wire effects by the use of varactor in the LNA. The design includes gain variation to achieve linearity requirements. The UMC 180nm CMOS extracted results of the QLMVF cell show, 42.5dB of conversion gain, 10dB of noise figure, less than 15dB of S-11, -23dBm of 1dB compression, -8.5dBm of out band IIP3 and 57.6dB of spurious free dynamic range (SFDR).

Batteries are polluting materials and they must be replaced. This paper presents an implementation of a self-powered speed sensor that uses energy harvesting to power itself, it measures the speed and transmits the data using Bluetooth Low Energy (BLE) to external devices such as smartphones. The energy harvester is a coil that acts as sensor, too. A prototype of the sensor has been built and a voltage regulation circuit has been simulated by using a SPICE simulator. Furthermore, a custom firmware has been designed using a Bluetooth Low Energy nRF51822 SoC by Nordic Semiconductor and the parameters of the BLE connection has been accurately chosen to obtain low energy consumptions. Finally, the energy balance between the harvested energy by the coil and the used energy by the SoC has been accomplished. The results demonstrate the technical feasibility of the self-powered BLE speed sensor for bicycles.

The real time simulator is a simulation using the data collected in real time, which is effective in reduce prediction error and support quick decision making. However, due to a high analytical cost in the conventional work measurement, it is difficult to continuously collect the worker's behavior data of the cellular manufacturing system in real time. For this purpose, first we built an experimental cellular manufacturing line that is able to collect the workers' behavior data in real time using the Bluetooth low energy beacons and acceleration sensors. Thereby, we constructed a real time simulation to combine the analyzed behavior data and a discrete event simulation. The result revealed that, the relative error between our method and the video observation method is small, and the prediction error of our simulation is smaller than using the standard work time.

J	Paek, J; Ko, J; Shin, H				Paek, Jeongyeup; Ko, JeongGil; Shin, Hyungsik			A Measurement Study of BLE iBeacon and Geometric Adjustment Scheme for Indoor Location-Based Mobile Applications	MOBILE INFORMATION SYSTEMS			English	Article								Bluetooth Low Energy (BLE) and the iBeacons have recently gained large interest for enabling various proximity-based application services. Given the ubiquitously deployed nature of Bluetooth devices including mobile smartphones, using BLE and iBeacon technologies seemed to be a promising future to come. This work started off with the belief that this was true: iBeacons could provide us with the accuracy in proximity and distance estimation to enable and simplify the development of many previously difficult applications. However, our empirical studies with three different iBeacon devices from various vendors and two types of smartphone platforms prove that this is not the case. Signal strength readings vary significantly over different iBeacon vendors, mobile platforms, environmental or deployment factors, and usage scenarios. This variability in signal strength naturally complicates the process of extracting an accurate location/proximity estimation in real environments. Our lessons on the limitations of iBeacon technique lead us to design a simple class attendance checking application by performing a simple form of geometric adjustments to compensate for the natural variations in beacon signal strength readings. We believe that the negative observations made in this work can provide future researchers with a reference on how well of a performance to expect from iBeacon devices as they enter their system design phases.

ECG can now be measured off-the-person, requiring nothing more than dry electrodes or conductive fabrics to acquire a usable ECG signal. However, identification still has a relatively poor performance when using large user databases. In this paper we suggest using ECG authentication associated with a smartphone security token in order to improve performance and decrease the time required for the recognition. This paper reports the implementation of this technique in a user authentication scenario for a Windows login using normal Bluetooth (BT) and Bluetooth Low Energy (BLE). This paper also uses Intel Edison's mobility features to create a more versatile environment.

Application examples include location-based information and advertisements, logistics, social networking, file sharing, etc. In this paper, we consider network-based positioning based on times series of proximity reports from a mobile device, either only a proximity indicator, or a vector of RSS from observed nodes. Such positioning corresponds to a latent and nonlinear observation model. To address these problems, we combine two powerful tools, namely particle filtering and Gaussian process regression (GPR) for radio signal propagation modeling. The latter also provides some insights into the spatial correlation of the radio propagation in the considered area. Radio propagation modeling and positioning performance are evaluated in a typical office area with Bluetooth-Low-Energy (BLE) beacons deployed for proximity detection and reports. Results show that the positioning accuracy can be improved by using GPR.

A tracking system to localize people within a building has been developed using a novel infrastructure system and a custom signal processing method. Knowledge whether people are present or not in every room enables the automatic switching-off of lighting and heating/cooling in empty room increasing the energy efficiency of building system. The implemented method achieves performance comparable to that of a traditional Bluetooth Low Energy indoor location system, nevertheless fewer devices are used. As a result, the cost of installation in existing building decreases.

They must rely on other people's help or technical supports. In this paper we show how direct communication with the bus driver via Bluetooth Low Energy (BLE) is possible. A person with visual restriction is able to send and receive messages via an accessible smart-phone app directly to the bus driver. With the help of the suggested system traveling with public transport gets easier and the person's independent mobility is improved.

We are deploying them in our homes to manage the level of comfort, energy consumption or security. While such smart appliances are becoming an integral part of modern home automation systems, their integration into non-residential buildings is problematic. Indeed, smart appliance vendors rely on the assumption that the Local Area Network (LAN) guarantees locality and a single unit of use/administration. This assumption is not met in non-residential buildings, where the LAN infrastructure might cover one or several buildings, and where several organizations or functional units are co-located. Worse, directly coupling smart appliances to the Internet opens up a range of security issues as device owners have very little control over the way their smart appliances interact with external services. In order to address these problems, we propose a solution that couples the use and management of smart appliances with physical locality. Put differently, we propose that smart appliances can be accessed via smartphones, but only from the room they are located in. Our solution combines opportunistic connectivity through local Bluetooth Low Energy (BLE) with an ultrasound-based method for room level isolation. We describe and evaluate a prototype system, deployed in 25 offices and 2 common spaces of an office building. This work opens up intriguing avenues for new research focused on the representation and utilization of physical locality for decentralized building management.

Existing low-power wireless network architectures are designed in isolated networks, and ensure a satisfying level of performance in homogeneous networks. However, with co-existence of different low-power networks, the interoperability related problems arise. To bridge this gap in this paper, we study various protocol stacks (i.e., Bluetooth, Bluetooth Low Energy, IEEE 802.15.4, ZigBee, 6LoWPAN and IEEE 802.15.6), and explain their specific features. Furthermore, we provide a generic protocol stack design that facilitates multiple radios with different protocol stacks, regardless of being IP-based or non-IP-based networks. We see this approach as a possibility to enhance network performance in terms of reliability, timeliness, and security, while providing higher levels of scalability and connectivity.

The typical HEMS employs a home server or a gateway to aggregate the energy consumption data, and uses ZigBee, PLC, or WiFi based connection-oriented communications as a data transmission method. The proposed method utilizes the connectionless communication of Bluetooth Low Energy as a data transmission method. Thereby, the proposed method can enhance the energy efficiency of data communication, and make it possible to aggregate the energy consumption data of multiple home appliances simultaneously.

The system uses an inexpensive (< $0.05) disposable moisture sensor combined with a re-usable temperature sensor and a Bluetooth Low-Energy transceiver module costing less than $15. The battery lifetime using the CR2032 coin cell is greater than 3 years while sampling data at 10s intervals. This sensor data can be used for monitoring, alerting, statistical analysis, and potentially reducing the incidence of infections. The data can be monitored and processed locally or stored on a server to be analyzed remotely. The prototyped devices were tested and shown to detect as little as 10 mL of tap water when poured into the smart brief. The temperature resolution of less than 0.25 degrees F was observed and a wireless range of 20 m indoors and 100 m outdoors was measured.

The Pico academic project proposes an authentication token unlocked by the proximity of simpler wearable devices that provide shares of the token's master key. This method, however, is vulnerable to a cold boot attack: an adversary who captures a running Pico could extract the master key from its RAM and steal all of the user's credentials. We present a cryptographic countermeasure-bivariate secret sharing-that protects all the credentials except the one in use at that time, even if the token is captured while it is on. Remarkably, our key storage costs for the wearables that supply the cryptographic shares are very modest (256 bits) and remain constant even if the token holds thousands of credentials. Although-bivariate secret sharing has been used before in slightly different ways, our scheme is leaner and more efficient and achieves a new property-cold boot protection. We validated the efficacy of our design by implementing it on a commercial Bluetooth Low Energy development board and measuring its latency and energy consumption. For reasonable choices of latency and security parameters, a standard CR2032 button-cell battery can power our prototype for 5-7 months, and we demonstrate a simple enhancement that could make the same battery last for over 9 months.

The prevalence of smartphones offers an opportunity to connect the physical and digital world. Bluetooth Low Energy beacons are small devices, which send out a signal that can be detected by consumer's smartphones to enable location-based services. However, there are very few documented cases of beacon usage in Germany, whereas they seem to have a much higher adoption in the US. In this paper, we investigate the challenges associated with the use of beacons in retail. Using a survey, we aim to understand the attitude towards beacons-based services from a sample of consumers in Germany.

Protecting Privacy of BLE Device Users	PROCEEDINGS OF THE 25TH USENIX SECURITY SYMPOSIUM			English	Proceedings Paper	25th USENIX Security Symposium	AUG 10-12, 2016	Austin, TX	USENIX, Facebook, NSF, Cisco, Google, Microsoft, Neustar, IBM Res, Symantec, ACM Queue, ADMIN, CRC Press, Linux Pro Magazine, NetApp, VMWare, LXer, UserFriendly Org, OReilly Media, No Starch Press, Virus Bulletin			INTERNET; THINGS	Bluetooth Low Energy (BLE) has emerged as an attractive technology to enable Internet of Things (IoTs) to interact with others in their vicinity. Our study of the behavior of more than 200 types of BLE-equipped devices has led to a surprising discovery: the BLE protocol, despite its privacy provisions, fails to address the most basic threat of all-hiding the device's presence from curious adversaries. Revealing the device's existence is the stepping stone toward more serious threats that include user profiling/fingerprinting, behavior tracking, inference of sensitive information, and exploitation of known vulnerabilities on the device. With thousands of manufacturers and developers around the world, it is very challenging, if not impossible, to envision the viability of any privacy or security solution that requires changes to the devices or the BLE protocol. In this paper, we propose a new device-agnostic system, called BLE-Guardian, that protects the privacy of the users/environments equipped with BLE devices/IoTs. It enables the users and administrators to control those who discover, scan and connect to their devices. We have implemented BLE-Guardian using Ubertooth One, an off-the-shelf open Bluetooth development platform, facilitating its broad deployment. Our evaluation with real devices shows that BLE-Guardian effectively protects the users' privacy while incurring little overhead on the communicating BLE-devices.

The wireless posture monitoring system presented in this chapter obtains the orientation in space of each body segment in which the sensor nodes are placed and calculates the trunk angle, the knee angle and the angle of inclination of the road. This system collects raw sensor data from accelerometers, magnetometers and gyroscopes and sends the data via BLE to an Android smartphone, which plays the role of central station and performs the data processing concerning the posture calculation. This chapter describes the development of the hardware and software of the sensor nodes, which are based on the CC2540 BLE system-on-chip, as well as the development of the Android application. Experimental results concerning the measurement of the posture of a cyclist are provided in order to validate the implementation.

In this paper, we proposed an indoor localization approach based on received signal strength (RSS) and Bayesian filter. In the following sections, we describe our virtual modeling method of environment and the way we take object's movement sequences as history conditions in Bayesian filter. The experiment results show that our solution provides accurate tracking results (within 80 centimeters for moving object). The contribution of this research is that it provides a general implementation utilizing Bayesian filter which is able to estimate location precisely with off-the-shelf hardware. And Bluetooth Low Energy (BLE) is employed which reduces power consumption considerably. Meanwhile the accuracy is sufficient for pedestrian tracking in real application scenarios where BLE devices can be easily deployed.

OBJECTVE: We developed three iPhone 5 applications for an RTLS and communications using Bluetooth low energy (BLE). METHODS: The applications were: Peripheral device tags, Central beacons, and a Monitor. A Peripheral communicated with a Central using BLE. The Central communicated with a Monitor using sockets on TCP/IP (Transmission Control Protocol/Internet Protocol) via a WLAN (wireless local area network). To determine a BLE threshold level for the received signal strength indicator (RSSI), relationships between signal strength and distance were measured in our laboratory and on the terrace. RESULTS: The BLE RSSI threshold was set at -70 dB, about 10 m. While an individual with a Peripheral moved around in a concrete building, the Peripheral was captured in a few 10-sec units at about 10 m from a Central. The Central and Monitor showed and saved the approach events, location, and Peripheral's nickname sequentially in real time.

The traditional TSBs use sign boards as a signal for vehicles and expect the drivers to be aware the sign board. In some scenarios, such as rains, traffic jam, light intensity, and vehicle speed, reduce the visibility of the TSBs. In this work, we proposed a smart traffic sign board system using Bluetooth Low Energy (BLE). The system opportunistically advertises the TSB information to road users (e.g., drivers, passengers, and riders) using BLE.

Although the cost of the BLE components is decreasing, the installation costs remain high. When many BLE devices are installed, determination of the locations for installation, referred to as the configuration, becomes complicated and labor intensive. In this research, we investigate computational methods for configuring BLE devices in a given region. We propose a computation method using k-means method and present numerical results. We then evaluate the proposed method in terms of the number of generation points and the number of BLE devices to be installed. We also introduce a measure for the configuration.

The designed controller consists of a hardware and software part. The hardware part consists of a link layer and a physical layer (analog radio), which is out of the scope of this work. Great emphasis was placed on minimizing hardware area and power consumption. Most of the complex and sequential functions were moved to the software Intermediate Layer introduced in this paper. Furthermore, Single Port RAM (SPRAM) was used to reduce the number of registers in the design. Flexibility was achieved by division of the hardware into two separate clock domains. Hardware part was designed using fully synthesizable Verilog HDL to simplify integration process into a System on Chip (SoC). In the proposed architecture the standard Bluetooth software stack may be used for the controller management. The controller architecture, implementation and verification strategies are described in this paper.

They are essential for qualifications the arterial stiffness and change blood pressure. Can be useful to detect sleep respiratory events or microarousals. The article proposes two concepts aimed at solving the issue of measuring pulse wave velocity PWV and pulse transit time PTT. The first concept focuses on the measurement of the pulse wave and the ECG signal, necessary to determine PWV, with one of the measurement modules. The second concept consists in the use of two separate modules, integrated in the wireless WBAN network system. The secondary module is responsible for the acquisition of the pulse signal in this method. The primary module (integrator) synchronizes the operation of both modules in the WBAN network, acquires the ECG signal, as well as calculates PWV and PTT, and other significant parameters. The integrator also permits wireless communication with external systems. The paper presents the way in which the measurements were made, research into the use of the first method, and the current works to adjust the modules to the implementation of the second concept.

From technical and economical points of view, Bluetooth Low Energy (BLE) is one of the promising technologies in this field. This paper deals with the study of performances of this technology for these purposes. For the indoor localization, a received signal strength indication (RSSI) method is used. It was tested in ideal (anechoic chamber) and real (in the office) environment conditions. For the measurement campaign and evaluation of the obtained results a generic framework is proposed. Experimental results (simulation vs. measurement) show similar behaviour of the BLE technology in ideal (no signal reflection) and real (multipath propagation) transmission environments.

In this paper, we propose a complete solution for the creation of study groups in future smart libraries featuring (i) a smartphone application to create study groups, (ii) a hybrid Bluetooth Low Energy (BLE) and Wi-Fi indoor positioning system to localize study groups and (iii) a server-based infrastructure based on MQTT and Node-RED to advertise study groups to other students. We describe in details all components of the architecture and perform an experimental evaluation of the indoor positioning system in a realistic scenario.	[Antevski, Kiril; Redondi, Alessandro E.

We feel that there is a need to build software that would allow users to configure the use of beacon data subject to the requirements of an application context, and to reuse the same set of beacons for some other purpose by just modifying the configuration. In this paper we describe uBeacon, a cloud based service with a web interface that allows users to define configurations that include constraints between beacon signal readers and beacons linked to objects or people. These constraints take the form of rules, such as "Object A should always be within 1m of object/reader B." uBeacon stores these configurations in a database, continuously monitors beacon data from readers, and notifies users via mobile push notifications whenever a rule of a configuration has been violated. We report the results of a pilot study with a set of participants and discuss the several possible applications of uBeacon to highlight its usefulness.

In day care center, caretakers are taking care records aiming to improve care receiver's Quality of Life (QoL). However, in the present situation, it is difficult for caretakers to record care receiver's activity in detail because each care worker needs to take care of several care receivers at the same time and it is a large burden. To reduce the burden of caretakers, many elderly monitoring systems have been proposed so far, but most of them are not effective in the sense that they force care receivers to use dedicated device such as smart phone and/or particular applications that are obtrusive and cumbersome for care receivers. In this paper, we propose a novel elderly monitoring system which can monitor movements/activity of multiple care receivers at the same time by estimating existence area of each of the care receivers, without burdening them. Our proposed system estimates multiple care receivers existence area only using RSSI (Received Signal Strength Indication) of BLE (Bluetooth Low Energy). The feature of our proposed system is that it takes Movable-Beacon and Fixed Scanner style. We have validated the proposed system and confirmed that we can estimate multi-person's existence area at high accuracy using only BLE devices.

They typically associate location information, provided by GPS or Bluetooth Low Energy devices, with remote content accessible through the Internet. However, Internet connectivity, especially in outdoor spaces, is not always available or may be too costly to be used for downloading large content (e.g. when users are abroad or have a limited data plan). In this paper we propose Live Objects, a system for infrastructure-less proximity-based services. Live Objects are pervasive media-server devices, which can be discovered by users and stream locally stored media content in proximity without the need for an Internet connection. Live Objects can be installed anywhere, even in places without power supply and communication infrastructure. We demonstrate a deployment of Live Objects in an outdoor test field. Using these devices, together with an Android app and a software middleware, users can have a self-guided tour of the area, discover the interesting places, and get associated information, particularly in the form of high-resolution video.

As the Internet of Things (IoT) comes of age, people increasingly want to use various devices in the surrounding environment in conjunction with their smartphones. The cost of developing services that cooperate with the devices is high because various kinds of devices exist and multiple OSs for smartphones need to be supported. To mitigate the issue, we propose a dynamic device connection method that can connect services (e.g. Web applications) with devices located close to users by installing the device drivers and/or protocol adapters dynamically. Developers can create new Web applications easily because the device drivers absorb the differences of the devices and provide a common Web interface for them. The protocol adapters provide access capability to OS application programming interfaces (APIs) for Web technology. We implemented the proposed method on an Android smartphone and evaluated it with Bluetooth Low Energy devices and a Classic Bluetooth device. Results showed that the method absorbs the difference of function and protocol and delivers a reasonable performance.

This paper implements a security concept to mitigate weaknesses of current beacon concepts against forgery and request tracking. The method authenticates beacons with dynamic data by attaching secure signatures. The architecture is especially useful as a many-to-many solution. A test setup shows applicability in a public transportation vehicle to accompany the passenger information system and traveller route planning. A setup on a tram equipped with up to five beacons provided securely authenticated passenger guidance in and around the tram, referencing even a user's device in a pocket.

LOCATHE contributes to: (1) forward secrecy through ephemeral session keys; (2) security through zero-knowledge password proofs (ZKPP), such that no passwords can be learned from the exchange; (3) the ability to use not only location, but also multiple authentication factors from a user to a service; (4) providing a two-tiered privacy authentication scheme, in which a user may be authenticated either based on her attributes (hiding her unique identification), or with a full individual authentication; (5) employing the expressiveness and flexibility of Decentralized or Multi-Authority Ciphertext-Policy Attribute-Based Encryption, allowing multiple service providers to control their respective key generation and attributes.

The problem though is that even if the only requirement is room-level localization, those systems are most of the times not cost-efficient and not easy to set-up, since they often require time-consuming calibration procedures. This paper presents a low-cost, threshold-based approach and introduces an algorithm that takes into account both the Received Signal Strength Indication (RSSI) of the Bluetooth Low Energy (BLE) beacons and the geometry of the rooms the beacons are placed in. Performance evaluation was done via measurements in an office environment composed of three rooms and in a house environment composed of six rooms. The experimental results show an improved accuracy in room detection when using the proposed algorithm, compared to when only considering the RSSI readings. This method was developed to provide context awareness to the international research project named SmartHeat. The projects aims to provide a system that efficiently heats a house, room by room, based on the habitants' habits and preferences.

The system was evaluated by 10 test walks along an 80m long indoor track including stairs and running. 95% of the time the average error for a particle was below 3.1 m with filter completion success rate of 90%. Furthermore, a system without UWB using only IMU, BLE and map matching achieved an average error for a particle to be below 3.6 m with filter completion success rate of 70%. The selected technologies and sensors are affordable and easily deployable. Inertial measurement unit's characteristics complement the disadvantages in the rf technologies and vice versa. The code for the rover can be implemented on a modern mobile device together with a foot mounted IMU.

We analyzed the fundamental algorithms in communications systems on IoT devices to enable a microarchitecture design that supports many IoT standards and custom nonstandard communications. Based on this analysis, we propose a custom SIMD execution model coupled with a scalar unit. We introduce several architectural optimizations to this design: streaming registers, variable bit width data-path, dedicated ALUs for critical kernels, and an optimized flexible reduction network. We employ voltage scaling and clock gating to further reduce the power, while more than a 100% time margin has been reserved for reliable operation in the near-threshold region. Together our architectural enhancements lead to a 71x power reduction compared to a classic general purpose SDR SIMD architecture. Our IoT SDR datapath has sub-mW power consumption based on SPICE simulation, and is placed and routed to fit within an area of 0.074mm(2) in a 28nm process. We implemented several essential elementary signal processing kernels and combined them to demonstrate two end-to-end upper bound systems, 802.15.4-OQPSK and Bluetooth Low Energy. Our full SDR baseband system consists of a configurable SIMD with a control plane MCU and memory. For comparison, the best commercial wireless transceiver consumes 23.8mW for the entire wireless system (digital/RF/analog). We show that our digital system power is below 2mW, in other words only 8% of the total system power. The wireless system is dominated by RF/analog power comsumption, thus the price of flexibility that SDR affords is small. We believe this work is unique in demonstrating the value of baseband SDR in the low power IoT domain.

We consider a system where mobile devices send periodic BLE beacons (consisting of the devices' identity) and the infrastructure nodes are required to track these devices to gather information about the users behavior in order to improve customized services provided to the user. For such systems, we propose the design and present a prototype (on CSR 1010 kits) where location detection and tracking are done via vision-based approach assisted by the RF observations. Features, extensions and optimizations of this system are discussed in detail. Emphasis is provided on in-network processing to disambiguate the multiple objects detected using image processing and assign the right identities as received via BLE beacons to the right objects. Further, the approach provides reduction in the beacon generation rate from the user devices, thereby improving the battery lifetime of the end devices.

The infrastructure in the vehicles detects the passengers' presence and initiates services unnoticed in the background. Whereas first implementations of BIBO systems are based on active Radio Frequency Identification (RFID), where users carry small RFID-tags in their pockets, we focus on Bluetooth Low Energy (BLE) as an alternative but potentially more powerful technology for this domain. We try to carve out differences, accentuate arising opportunities for interaction and evidence the applicability of BLE for BIBO systems by a series of conducted screening tests.

Currently available indoor positioning technologies differ in terms of accuracy, costs and effort, but have improved quickly in the last couple of years. It has been actively conducted research for estimating indoor location using RSSI (Received Signal Strength Indicator) level of Wi-Fi access points or BLE (Bluetooth Low Energy) tags. WiFi signal is commonly used for the indoor positioning technology. However, It requires an external power source, more setup costs and expensive. BLE is inexpensive, small, have a long battery life and do not require an external energy source. Therefore, by adding some BLE tags we might be able to enhance the accuracy inexpensive way. In this paper, we propose a new type of indoor positioning method based on WiFi-BLE fusion with Fingerprinting method. WiFi RSSI and BLE RSSI are separately processed each one by a Naive Bayes Classifier. Then, Multilayer Perceptron(MLP) is used as the fusion classifier. Preliminary experimental result shows 2.55m error in case of the MLP output. Since the result is not as good as the ones using conventional method, further test and investigation needs to be performed.

J	Basalamah, A				Basalamah, Anas			Sensing the Crowds Using Bluetooth Low Energy Tags	IEEE ACCESS			English	Article						Bluetooth low energy; crowdsensing; Hajj		Sensing the crowds to understand crowd dynamics can be a challenging task. Passive sensing techniques such as camera-based sensing can provide flow detection, people counting, and density estimation, but they fail to provide accurate identification of individuals mobility patterns. Active techniques such as Radio Frequency Identification (RFID) tags given to people require expensive RFID readers deployed to perform sensing. In this paper, we propose to use Bluetooth low energy (BLE) tagging as an alternative method. When low-cost BLE tags are set in advertisement mode, they can be detected by smartphones. In this paper, we design an architecture for sensing the crowds by requiring a large population carrying relatively cheap off-the-shelf BLE proximity tags, and considerably fewer participants to run scanning application on their smartphones to collect data. We performed a large experimental deployment with 600 tags and ten smartphones conducted during the five days of the world largest annual gathering (The Hajj). We were able to achieve 90% detectability rate while effectively reconstructing the routes of the participants.

Typical treatment methods for plantar fasciitis include medications (NSAIDs), exercises, physical therapy, and surgery. Mobile Health (mHealth) technologies stand to improve care for plantar fasciitis via daily monitoring and by addressing barriers to patient adherence with treatment programs. The ability to closely monitor treatment also gives opportunities for curation that were previously unavailable. Pain and inflammation can be decreased by following a simple home exercise routine of stretches specific to the plantar fascia [1]. Our team has developed a system for assistance with monitoring of home exercise program for treatment of plantar fasciitis. The system interfaces Bluetooth Low Energy (BLE) devices with smartphones to send and receive accelerometer and other sensory data, and an accompanying app to be used for at home monitoring and analysis of physical therapy exercises which have been shown to help with plantar fasciitis [2]. Such system can be used to track movement, amplitude, angle, pressure, stretch, and number of repetitions, and overall improve patient adherence to a Home Exercise Program and involvement in treatment. Increased self-monitoring has been shown to directly influence and increase behavior change of patients. In order to increase patient adherence to a prescribed routine, awareness of a behavior and the consistent tracking of its implementation and progress over time are effective [3]. Modern BLE devices are very energy efficient and can work throughout the course of a day, making them an apt choice for a home treatment program. The accompanying app receives, aggregates, and analyzes data from the BLE sensor, and provides actionable feedback to users and clinicians. By increasing patient adherence and speeding up healing, this mHealth system will improve patient outcomes regarding treatment of plantar fasciitis, and also decrease cost of treatment.

J	Lee, SH; Lim, IK; Lee, JK				Lee, Seoung-Hyeon; Lim, Il-Kwan; Lee, Jae-Kwang			Method for Improving Indoor Positioning Accuracy Using Extended Kalman Filter	Mobile Information Systems			English	Article							SYSTEMS; LOCATION; FUTURE	Beacons using bluetooth low-energy (BLE) technology have emerged as a new paradigm of indoor positioning service (IPS) because of their advantages such as low power consumption, miniaturization, wide signal range, and low cost. However, the beacon performance is poor in terms of the indoor positioning accuracy because of noise, motion, and fading, all of which are characteristics of a bluetooth signal and depend on the installation location. Therefore, it is necessary to improve the accuracy of beacon-based indoor positioning technology by fusing it with existing indoor positioning technology, which uses Wi-Fi, ZigBee, and so forth. This study proposes a beacon-based indoor positioning method using an extended Kalman filter that recursively processes input data including noise. After defining the movement of a smartphone on a flat two-dimensional surface, it was assumed that the beacon signal is nonlinear. Then, the standard deviation and properties of the beacon signal were analyzed. According to the analysis results, an extended Kalman filter was designed and the accuracy of the smartphone's indoor position was analyzed through simulations and tests. The proposed technique achieved good indoor positioning accuracy, with errors of 0.26 m and 0.28 m from the average x- and y-coordinates, respectively, based solely on the beacon signal.

The advantage of this technology lies in its support by contemporary mobile devices, especially by smartphones and tablets. We have implemented a distributed system for collecting radio fingerprints by mobile devices with the Android operating system. This system enables volunteers to create radio-maps and update them continuously. New Bluetooth Low Energy transmitters (Apple uses its "iBeacon" brand name for these devices) have been installed on the floor of the building in addition to existing WiFi access points. The localization of stationary objects based on WiFi, Bluetooth Low Energy, and their combination has been evaluated using the data measured during the experiment in the building. Several configurations of the transmitters' arrangement, several ways of combination of the data from both technologies, and other parameters influencing the accuracy of the stationary localization have been tested.

Seamless Guidance System Combining GPS, BLE Beacon, and NFC Technologies	MOBILE INFORMATION SYSTEMS			English	Article								Users rely increasingly on Location-Based Services (LBS) and automated navigation/guidance systems nowadays. However, while such services are easily implemented in outdoor environments using Global Positioning System (GPS) technology, a requirement still exists for accurate localization and guidance schemes in indoor settings. Accordingly, the present study proposes a system based on GPS, Bluetooth Low Energy (BLE) beacons, and Near Field Communication (NFC) technology. Through establishing graphic information and the design of algorithm, this study develops a guidance system for indoors and outdoors on smart phones, wishing to give user perfect smart life through this system. The proposed system is implemented on a smart phone and evaluated on a student campus environment. The experimental results confirm the ability of the proposed app to switch automatically from an outdoor mode to an indoor mode and to guide the user to requested target destination via the shortest possible route.

In daycare center, caretakers make a daycare report aiming to improve the senior citizen's Quality of Life. However, in the aged society, it is difficult for caretakers to record the senior citizen's activity in detail, since each caretaker needs to take care of several senior citizens at the same time. In this paper, we propose a semi-automatic daycare report generation system. Our proposed system estimates the present area and activity of the senior citizen by utilizing the accelerometer-implemented-BLE-beacon tags and generate the daycare report. Based on the generated report, the caretaker works effectively. Evaluation result in a daycare center showed that our system estimated the subject's present area with F-measure: 80.6% and activity with F-measure: 73.8% and automatically generated the daycare report.

This paper examines the use of BLE beacons for the discovery of content in mobile guides implemented as Progressive Web Applications. Cilogi is a framework for the creation of guides that run on mobile devices. BLE beacons are small devices that broadcast their identity to nearby mobile devices using much less energy than classic Bluetooth devices. The new Eddystone message format broadcasts enables broadcasting of a URL. This makes BLE beacons an alternative way of communicating the URL of individual pages of a mobile guide in an exhibition setting.

Thus, humans as they walk in cities pass by different beacons and the sequence of beacons form a path. In this paper, we present how those augmented paths can authenticate a user in a secure way whereby the users can prove they have passed by a path, even with current unsecure beacons. We have built a prototype to validate this new authentication scheme with unsecure Estimote beacons. In addition, as an alternative to BLE, a similar system utilizing Wi-Fi to detect user proximity is reviewed as well.

The system transmits a wide-band ultrasonic signal into a room and then processes the superposition of the reflections recorded by a microphone. The system has two modes of operation, one for presence detection and one for estimating the number of occupants in a region. The presence detection uses the difference between multiple transmissions in succession with a set of general classifiers that make a binary decision about if the room contains occupants. We then use a semi-supervised learning approach based on Weighted Principal Component Analysis (WPCA) that requires minimal training data to estimate the number of occupants. We also present the design of an energy harvesting embedded platform and demonstrate that our algorithm can continuously execute using energy harvested from indoor solar panels. The platform has a dual Bluetooth Low-Energy and 802.15.4 interface to communicate with a gateway or nearby mobile phone that runs an interface that aids in collecting training data. We evaluate our algorithm on a wide-variety of indoor spaces as well as benchmark the hardware in terms of sampling rate given an energy budget. On more than three weeks of data, we see that we can detect motions with an average of 85% recall rate and perform occupancy counting with an average error of 10% in terms of maximum occupancy.

Sensor deployments often tend towards low-power communication protocols such as Bluetooth Low Energy or IEEE 802.15.4. Gateways are essential to connect these devices to the Internet at large. Over time though, gateways have gained additional responsibilities as well. Sensors expect gateways to handle device-specific data translation and local processing while also providing services, such as time synchronization, to the low-power device. As a centralized computing resource, the gateway is also an obvious location for running local applications which interact with sensor data and control nearby actuators. Today, vendors and researchers often create their own device-specific gateways to handle these responsibilities. We propose a generic gateway platform capable of supporting the needs of many devices. In our architecture, devices provide a pointer, such as a URL, to descriptions of their interfaces. The gateway can download the interface descriptions and use them to determine how to interact with the device, translating its data to a usable format and enabling local services to communicate with it. The translated data is provided to services including user applications, local logging, device status monitoring, and cloud applications. By simultaneously supporting communication with many sensors, our gateway architecture can simplify future sensor network deployments and enable intelligent building applications.

The usage of signal propagation models for indoor localization requires calibration phase because the path loss model parameters take into account multipath propagation, shadowing and fading influences. This phase of such indoor localization technique using signal propagation model can be eliminated by automated procedure of parameter calibration. For this objective Bluetooth Low Energy beacon proximity zones and smartphone built-in sensors can be used.

Applications of Secure Location Sensing in Healthcare	PROCEEDINGS OF THE 7TH ACM INTERNATIONAL CONFERENCE ON BIOINFORMATICS, COMPUTATIONAL BIOLOGY, AND HEALTH INFORMATICS			English	Proceedings Paper	7th ACM International Conference on Bioinformatics, Computational Biology, and Health Informatics (ACM-BCB)	OCT 02-05, 2016	Seattle, WA	Assoc Comp Machinery, ACM SIGBio, NSF		BLE; location sensing; beacon		Secure location sensing has the potential to improve healthcare processes regarding security, efficiency, and safety. For example, enforcing close physical proximity to a patient when using a barcode medication administration system (BCMA) can mitigate the consequences of unsafe barcode scanning workarounds. We present Beacon+, a Bluetooth Low Energy (BLE) device that extends the design of Apple's popular iBeacon specification with unspoofable, temporal, and authenticated advertisements. Our prototype Beacon+ design enables secure location sensing applications such as realtime tracking of hospital assets (e.g., infusion pumps). We implement this exact real-time tracking system and use it as a foundation for a novel application that applies location-based restrictions on access control.

The enzyme (uricase)-modified screen printed electrode system has been integrated onto a mouthguard platform along with anatomically-miniaturized instrumentation electronics featuring a potentiostat, microcontroller, and a Bluetooth Low Energy (BLE) transceiver. Unlike REID-based biosensing systems, which require large proximal power sources, the developed platform enables real-time wireless transmission of the sensed information to standard smartphones, laptops, and other consumer electronics for on-demand processing, diagnostics, or storage. The mouthguard biosensor system offers high sensitivity, selectivity, and stability towards uric acid detection in human saliva, covering the concentration ranges for both healthy people and hyperuricemia patients. The new wireless mouthguard biosensor system is able to monitor SUA level in real-time and continuous fashion, and can be readily expanded to an array of sensors for different analytes to enable an attractive wearable monitoring system for diverse health and fitness applications.

In the proposed solution, the LNA, mixers, VCO, quadrature scheme and the first stage of the analog base-band share the same bias current under a 0.8 V voltage supply leading to a sub-mW power consumption. A channel selection filter, implemented through a current re-use gm-C topology, completes the design. The presented prototype, realized in 130 nm CMOS technology, occupies an active area of 0.25 mm(2) while consuming only 0.6 mW. With a NF of 15.8 dB, an IIP3 of -17 dBm at the maximum gain and an image rejection above 30 dB the receiver front-end meets BLE noise figure, image rejection, phase noise and linearity requirements.

The radio part occupies 2.9 mm(2) while the complete SoC occupies 5.9 mm(2). The transceiver consumes 11 mW when receiving at -94 dBm and 10 mW when transmitting at 0 dBm. This is roughly a factor 2 lower than benchmark mass-produced designs. The power consumption is higher than recently published experimental sliding-IF designs, but it does not suffer from their inherent susceptibility to blocking and pulling. Easy application is enabled by a fully integrated single-ended 50 Omega RFIO and combined Buck-and Boost-mode DC-DC converter.

The installation of systems based on wireless networks can play a key role in the extension of the smart grid toward smart homes, that can be deemed as one of themost important components of smart grids. In fact, monitoring and control applications, energy harvesting, and innovative metering methodologies through smart wireless devices are becoming increasingly important. This paper proposes a novel energy management approach for smart homes that combines a wireless network, based on bluetooth low energy (BLE), for communication among home appliances, with a home energy management (HEM) scheme. The proposed approach addresses the impact of standby appliances and high-power rating loads in peak hours to the energy consumption charges of consumers. Simulation results show that the proposed approach is efficient in terms of reducing peak load demand and electricity consumption charges with an increase in the comfort level of consumers.

J	Faragher, R; Harle, R				Faragher, Ramsey; Harle, Robert			Location Fingerprinting With Bluetooth Low Energy Beacons	IEEE JOURNAL ON SELECTED AREAS IN COMMUNICATIONS			English	Article						Indoor positioning; location fingerprinting; bluetooth positioning; bluetooth low energy positioning; iBeacons	INDOOR; SYSTEMS	The complexity of indoor radio propagation has resulted in location-awareness being derived from empirical fingerprinting techniques, where positioning is performed via a previously-constructed radio map, usually of WiFi signals. The recent introduction of the Bluetooth Low Energy (BLE) radio protocol provides new opportunities for indoor location. It supports portable battery-powered beacons that can be easily distributed at low cost, giving it distinct advantages over WiFi. However, its differing use of the radio band brings new challenges too. In this work, we provide a detailed study of BLE fingerprinting using 19 beacons distributed around a similar to 600 m(2) testbed to position a consumer device. We demonstrate the high susceptibility of BLE to fast fading, show how to mitigate this, and quantify the true power cost of continuous BLE scanning. We further investigate the choice of key parameters in a BLE positioning system, including beacon density, transmit power, and transmit frequency. We also provide quantitative comparison with WiFi fingerprinting. Our results show advantages to the use of BLE beacons for positioning. For one-shot (push-to-fix) positioning we achieve < 2.6 m error 95% of the time for a dense BLE network (1 beacon per 30 m(2)), compared to < 4.8 m for a reduced density (1 beacon per 100 m(2)) and < 8.5 m for an established WiFi network in the same area.

This paper presents a comprehensive survey on energy conserving issues and solutions in using diverse wireless radio access technologies for IoT connectivity, e.g., the 3rd Generation Partnership Project (3GPP) machine type communications, IEEE 802.11ah, Bluetooth Low Energy (BLE), and Z-Wave. We look into the literature in broad areas of standardization, academic research, and industry development, and structurally summarize the energy conserving solutions based on several technical criteria. We also propose future research directions regarding energy conserving issues in wireless networking-based IoT.

The installation of systems based on wireless networks can play a key role also in the extension of the smart grid towards smart homes, that can be deemed as one of the most important components of smart grids. This paper proposes a fuzzy-based solution for smart energy management in a home automation wireless network. The approach, by using Bluetooth Low Energy (BLE), introduces a Fuzzy Logic Controller (FLC) in order to improve a Home Energy Management (HEM) scheme, addressing the power load of standby appliances and their loads in different hours of the day. Since the consumer is involved in the choice of switching on/off of home appliances, the approach introduced in this work proposes a fuzzy-based solution in order to manage the consumer feedbacks. Simulation results show that the proposed solution is efficient in terms of reducing peak load demand, electricity consumption charges with an increase comfort level of consumers. The performance of the proposed BLE-based wireless network scenario are validated in terms of packet delivery ratio, delay, and jitter and are compared to IEEE 802.15.4 technology.

J	Lee, BG; Lee, BL; Chung, WY				Lee, Boon-Giin; Lee, Boon-Leng; Chung, Wan-Young			Wristband-Type Driver Vigilance Monitoring System Using Smartwatch	IEEE SENSORS JOURNAL			English	Article						Accelerometer sensor; Bluetooth; gyroscope sensor; motion sensors; photoplethysmogram; smartwatch; wristband	DROWSINESS; EEG; CLASSIFICATION; ALERTNESS; FATIGUE; SIGNALS; FUSION	Studies have presented that the driver vigilance level has serious implication in the causation of road accidents. This paper focuses on integrating both the vehicle-based control behavior and physiological state to predict the driver vigilance index which is evaluated by using a smartwatch. The vehicle control behavior can be observed from the steering wheel movement. Our study utilized the smartwatch motion sensors to study the steering wheel behavior. Meanwhile, physiological state of driver reflects the driver capability of safety alert driving which is estimated by photoplethysmogram (PPG) and respiration signals in this paper. The PPG sensor is integrated in a sport wristband with a Bluetooth low energy module, transmitted the PPG signals to smartwatch in real time. The steering angle is derived by the reading from smartwatch built-in accelerometer and gyroscope sensors. On the other hand, the respiration is derived using the PPG peak baseline method. In order to utterly investigate the sleepiness-induced factors, the time, spectral, and phase space domain features are calculated. Considering the smartwatch processing capability, mutual-information technique is applied to designate the ten most descriptive features. Then, the extracted descriptive features are serve as parameters to a classifier to determine the driver aptitude status. The features are analyzed for their correlation with the subjective Koralinska sleepiness scale and through recorded video observations. The experimental results reveal that our system is capable of estimating driver hypervigilance at average of 96.5% accuracy rate by evaluating on both driving behavior and driver physiological state, provided a novel and low-cost implementation.

Therefore, a real-time unobtrusive monitoring of respiration patterns, as well as breath parameters, is a critical need in medical applications. In this paper, we propose an intelligent system for patient home care, capable of measuring respiration rate and tidal volume variability via a wearable sensing technology. The proposed system is designed particularly for the goal of diagnosis and treatment in patients with pathological breathing, e.g., respiratory complications after surgery or sleep disorders. The complete system was comprised of wearable calibrated accelerometer sensor, Bluetooth low energy, and cloud database. The experiments are conducted with eight subjects and the overall error in respiration rate calculation is obtained 0.29%+/- 0.33% considering SPR-BTA spirometer as the reference. We also introduce a method for tidal volume variability estimation while validated using Pearson correlation. Furthermore, since it is essential to detect the critical events resulted from sudden rise or fall in per breath tidal volume of the patients, we provide a technique to automatically find the accurate threshold values based on each individual breath characteristics. Therefore, the system is able to detect the major changes, precisely by more than 98%, and provide immediate feedback such as sound alarm for round-the-clock respiration monitoring.

The transconductor employs local negative feedback for linearization controlling the drain voltage of the input transistors biased in the triode region. The gain boosted feedback amplifier is based on quasi-floating gate MOS transistors and its adjustable biasing current allows tuning the cutoff frequency of the filter. The filter is intended to be used in the baseband section of a zero-IF bluetooth low energy receiver and it has been fabricated in a standard 0.13-mu m CMOS technology with a nominal cutoff frequency of 500 kHz. The power consumption of the overall filter is 450 mu W with a supply voltage of 1.2 V. The measurement results show a third-order intermodulation distortion of -46.4 dB for two input tones located at the passband of the filter. The filter occupies a silicon area of 0.08 mm(2).

Fast dichotomic supervised I/Q imbalance compensation algorithm	ELECTRONICS LETTERS			English	Article							RECEIVERS	A fast I/Q imbalance compensation algorithm is presented. It is demonstrated through MATLAB simulations that with a few samples an image-to-signal ratio (ISR) lower than -25 dB was achieved. On the basis of digital processing of the received signal, this algorithm is compliant with low-cost and low-complexity wireless receivers because it does not require extra time and resources for calibration. Moreover, its fast convergence allows reaching a high enough image rejection ratio by adapting the compensation weight during the reception of a known preamble such as defined by the IEEE 802.15.4 or the Bluetooth low energy standards.

J	Joh, H; Ryoo, I				Joh, Hangki; Ryoo, Intae			A hybrid Wi-Fi P2P with bluetooth low energy for optimizing smart device's communication property	PEER-TO-PEER NETWORKING AND APPLICATIONS			English	Article						Bluetooth low energy; Smart device; Hybrid Wi-Fi P2P; Quality of service	NETWORKS; DISCOVERY	Recently, due to the popularity of smart devices, a need for various types of wireless communication has been tremendously increasing and several types of radio technologies for easy and quick communication with peripherals have appeared. In order for implementing a Personal Area Network (PAN), low power ZigBee and Bluetooth technologies have been generally used. On the other hand, Wi-Fi Local Area Network (LAN) technology has many advantages in implementing a PAN as it's chipset is integrated and it's transmission speed is relatively higher than the others. As the size of multimedia data like photos, videos, and music files has increased, more efficient communication environment for faster connection establishment and higher data transmission speed should be supported for end users accordingly. Because Bluetooth technology has intrincic limitations like transmission speed and coverage, new technologies are expected to provide longer transmission distances and higher transmission rates. Further, if the full functionality of Wi-Fi P2P standard would be implemented for today's smart devices, it would be possible to provide various kinds of mobile innovative services that could maximize user experience. Transmission rate of Bluetooth technology in early stages was only up to 1Mbps. Although this speed is as fast as 6-fold compared to existing techniques, Bluetooth can hardly support a satisfied level of services to transfer large amounts of data such as high quality musics and videos. Therefore, Bluetooth has been used only for specific communication services with limitations. Transmission speed of Bluetooth, however, has been significantly improved as time goes. That is, Bluetooth 2.0 released in 2004 supports maximum speed of 3Mbps, and Bluetooth 3.0 released in 2 009 supports up to 24Mbps. Bluetooth 4.0 released in 2 010 has low energy mode while maintaing 24Mbps and also supports coin cell with low power consumptioin. Wi-Fi P2P is a direct communication technology between terminals without any intermediate devices such as routers and access point (AP). Wi-Fi module is basically mounted on most of smart devices. Therefore, once Wi-Fi P2P technology is adapted to mobile terminals or mobile devices such as TV, laptop, printer, and camera, all the communication services and multimedia contents can be simply provided for these devices by using the Wi-Fi P2P. In this study, we have proposed a cross-layer system design for optimizing smart devices' communication property by utilizing the characteristics of high-speed data transmission rate of Wi-Fi P2P and low power consumption communication of Bluetooth. We have also verified that the proposed technique outperforms the existing Bluetooth and Wi-Fi P2P in the comparison of throughput as well as transmission delay through OPNET simulations, which leads to faster user connections and provides better quality of services to end users.

The D-size (55.8 cm(3)) soil energy cell with carbon and zinc electrodes can produce similar to 60-100 mu W, depending on the water contents and microbial reactions in the soil. The RC circuit model of a soil cell is proposed for understanding the electrical characteristics of the cell. The wireless sensing system, including temperature and air moisture sensors, a custom low-power capacitive sensor readout silicon chip, a microcontroller, and a Bluetooth low-energy transmitter, is demonstrated for long-term environmental monitoring solely by the fabricated D-size soil cell. The capacitive sensor readout chip is fabricated in a 0.18-mu m CMOS process and only consumes 3 mu W. The capacitance readout range is 160-200 pF. The total power consumption of the wireless temperature and air moisture monitoring system is similar to 20 mu W and 1 mW in the sleep mode and the active wireless data communication operations, respectively. The new technology can enable remote field environment monitoring with less labor-intensive work and battery replacement.

One popular IoT scenario features a smart home service gateway, which becomes the central point of user's home environment facilitating a multitude of tasks. Given that most IoT devices connected to residential gateway are small-scale and battery-powered, the key challenge is to extend their lifetime without recharging/replacing batteries. To this end, a novel radio technology named Bluetooth low energy (BLE) has recently been completed to enable energy-efficient data transfer. Another inspiring innovation is the capability of sensors to harvest wireless energy in their local environment. In this work, we envision a scenario where many in-home sensors are communicating with a smart gateway over the BLE protocol, while at the same time harvesting RF energy transmitted from the gateway wirelessly via a dedicated radio interface. We thoroughly investigate performance limitations of such wireless energy transfer interface (WETI) with dynamic analytical model and with important practical considerations. Our methodology delivers the upper bound on WETI operation coupled with BLE-based communication, which characterizes ultimate system performance over the class of practical radio and energy resource management algorithms.

Bluetooth for Internet of Things: A fuzzy approach to improve power management in smart homes	COMPUTERS & ELECTRICAL ENGINEERING			English	Article						Power consumption; Fuzzy logic controller; Bluetooth Low Energy; Internet of Things	ENERGY	Thanks to the introduction of the Internet of Things (IoT), the research and the implementation of home automation are getting more popular because the IoT holds promise for making homes smarter through wireless technologies. There is a main requirement that make a wireless protocol ideal for use in the IoT, that is the energy efficiency. Bluetooth Low Energy (BLE) has a high potential in becoming an important technology for the IoT in low power, low cost, small devices. However, specific techniques can be used in such a way as to further reduce the energy consumption of BLE. To this end, this paper proposes a fuzzy logic based mechanism that determine the sleeping time of field devices in a home automation environment based on BLE. The proposed FLC determines the sleeping time of field devices according to the battery level and to the ratio of Throughput to Workload (Th/Wl). Simulation results reveal that using the proposed approach the device lifetime is increased by 30% with respect to the use of fixed sleeping time. (C) 2015 Elsevier Ltd. All rights reserved.

Each complex pole is realized sharing a bias current among transconductors, leading to an ultralow-power solution. The filter, which is designed in the 130-nm complimentary metal-oxide-semiconductor technology, has a power dissipation of only 42 mu W from a 0.8-V supply voltage. With a center frequency and a passband of 2 and 1 MHz, respectively, the simulated filter provides a rejection of the adjacent channel of 34 dB and a spurious-free dynamic range of 52.7 dB.

A Blind Zone Alert System Based on Intra-Vehicular Wireless Sensor Networks	IEEE TRANSACTIONS ON INDUSTRIAL INFORMATICS			English	Article						Automotive sensors; blind zone detection; Bluetooth low energy (BLE); vehicle safety; vehicular networks; wireless sensor networks (WSN)	EFFICIENT; CHANNELS; PROTOCOL	Due to the increasing number of sensors deployed in modern vehicles, intra-vehicular wireless sensor networks (IVWSNs) have recently received a lot of attention in the automotive industry, as they can reduce the amount of wiring harness inside a vehicle. By removing the wires, car manufacturers can reduce the weight of a vehicle and improve engine performance, fuel economy, and reliability. In addition to these direct benefits, an IVWSN is a versatile platform that can support other vehicular applications as well. An example application, known as a side blind zone alert (SBZA) system, which monitors the blind zone of the vehicle and alerts the driver in a timely manner to prevent collisions, is discussed in this paper. The performance of the IVWSN-based SBZA system is evaluated via real experiments conducted on two test vehicles. Our results show that the proposed system can achieve approximately 95%-99% detection rate with less than 15% false alarm rate. Compared with commercial systems using radars or cameras, the main benefit of the IVWSN-based SBZA is substantially lower cost.

Mobile users then would be able to ubiquitously and spontaneously interact with things they encounter, enabling a wealth of diverse usage scenarios and applications. Currently, however, ST interaction requires a pre-controlled Internet or network connection as well as the prior installation of the ST-specific interaction interface, i.e., smartphone app. Users can thus only interact with known things, in contrast to the vision of spontaneous, ubiquitous discovery and interaction. We thus propose STIF (Smart Things Interaction Framework), enabling local wireless discovery of STs spontaneously via Wi-Fi, Bluetooth Low Energy, Visible Light Communication, or Acoustic Communication. STIF allows STs to transmit their interaction interface directly to users and supports interaction based on user input via touch and AR GUIs as well as motion and speech recognition. We implement STIF for Android phones as well as Arduino and Raspberry Pi things and demonstrate the real-life applicability of the supported communication and interaction techniques.

In this paper we present a range-based indoor localization system that exploits the Received Signal Strength (RSS) of Bluetooth Low Energy (BLE) beacon packets broadcast by anchor nodes and received by a BLE-enabled device. The method used to infer the user's position is based on stigmergy. We exploit the stigmergic marking process to create an on-line probability map identifying the user's position in the indoor environment.

Among them, the Bluetooth Low Energy( BLE) which has been widely adopted in the most of smartphone plays a major communication channel for the range of industrial applications as well as the personal applications. However, since BLE supports only the star topology, it is impossible to configure more complex network topologies, and, in turn, the coverage of the network is limited. In this paper, we propose a method to implement the tree topology network using the BLE. By switching the mode of the BLE module in each network node, it can communicate between nodes at the different layers of the tree topology.

The low power wireless sensor module offers 8 differential EMG channels and a 9-axis motion processor to enable study full body kinematics and muscle activity. The sensor has a 23 mm circular form factor and can be used in healthy subjects such as athletes and military during relevant field exercises to establish baseline bio-metric data without limiting their mobility. The system offers a standard Bluetooth Low Energy (BLE) wireless interface to communicate with gateway devices and desktop systems. Seven sensors can be placed on a subject and paired with a gateway device such as a cellular phone with BLE interface.

Due to the lower energy consumption and higher throughput, BLE could therefore be an integral pillar of an Internet of Things (IoT) Location Based Service (LBS). Tracking a user with high accuracy is known as Micro-Location. This is a requirement of many IoT user-centric applications for indoor environments. Although several technologies have been used for tracking purposes, the accuracy has always been a serious issue. At the same time, each vendor would install different technologies. In this work, we propose to use the cutting-edge and commercially available Apple's iBeacon protocol and iBeacon BLE sensors for micro-location. We propose to leverage a control theoretic approach, namely particle filtering, in order to increase the tracking accuracy in an indoor environment. We performed extensive experiments and our results show that the proposed beacon based micro-location system can be used to locate a user in an indoor environment with an error as low as 0.27 meters.

Especially, not limited to the service that can assist to people directly such as public safety, healthcare, proximity-based service, mobile payment, etc., a technology that can provide convenience indirectly such as asset tracking has also been proposed. Most of all, the indoor location awareness using BLE beacon is the essential technique that can realize these services, it is expected to be more focused if the more BLE beacon is spread in the future. In this paper, we first analyse practical path loss model of BLE signals with compared to that of Wi-Fi signals in order to take advantage of the BLE beacon for indoor positioning. To estimate the practical path loss model, we employed four BLE beacons (each two beacon is the same manufacturer) and two of Wi-Fi AP. Each signal was measured during one minute at each reference distance from 1m to 13m (with 2m interval) in a Line-of-Sight (LOS) environment. The calculated path loss model was used to generate a BLE signal virtually, we applied the model to configure the BLE radiomap and generate positioning measurement data in our simulation. Since BLE signal has relatively lower tx power compared to Wi-Fi APs, it requires much more beacons to achieve comparable positioning accuracy. We focused on the relationship between the number of installed beacon and its positioning accuracy in this paper.

Devices in IoT must be low powered in order to extend their lifetime. BLE compatible AltBeacon is aptly suited for this purpose. We have developed an application to show how various disparate technologies are integrated together to form IoT paradigm. We use a fixed AltBeacon node which allows an application running on a smart phone to determine its proximity with respect to the AltBeacon node. Once the application finds that it is within the proximity of the AltBeacon node then we can control various IP enabled devices through RESTful Service. We have proposed a software framework which can be used to automate IoT based on the proximity. This framework can be extended to control any of the IP enabled devices for Home Automation and Industrial Systems. From our experiments we determined that 1.5m is an optimum range for proximity.

In this paper, we propose a novel hybrid participatory sensing approach to capture large group dynamics. Specifically, our approach is based on distributing a large number of tiny, wearable Bluetooth Low Energy (BLE) tags and few smartphones among the group members. We start by identifying the best configuration; in terms of transmit power and beaconing interval; for detecting BLE tags in indoor and outdoor environments. Then, as a case study, we deploy the system during the six main days of the Hajj pilgrimage in 2014, which is the world's largest annual religious gathering. We used the proposed hybrid participatory approach to collect the mobility data of pilgrim groups based on GPS location and co-occurring BLE tag detections. Our system provided up to 80% group-wise detectability in a single scan event. Moreover, 98% cumulative unique tags detectability is achieved in the whole event, leading to 0.74 million records. Analysis of the group dynamics revealed unexpected behavior and interesting findings. In particular, regional variations are found among different groups in the entry or exit times, duration of stay, and group cohesion; which are attributed to congestion, improper arrangements, or the nature of activities. Furthermore, we show sub-community clusters could be identified revealing clear biases based on the demographic characteristics. Based on this case study, we also give suggestions on using the proposed system for other large-scale events.

As technologies like Bluetooth Low Energy (BLE) and Apple's iBeacon protocols begin to see widespread adoption, we will no doubt see a proliferation of indoor location enabled application experiences. While not essential to each of these applications, many will require that the location of the device be true and verifiable. In this paper, we present LocAssure, a new framework for trusted indoor location estimation. The system leverages existing technologies like BLE and iBeacons, making the solution practical and compatible with technologies that are already in use today. In this work, we describe our system, situate it within a broad location assurance taxonomy, describe the protocols that enable trusted localization in our system, and provide an analysis of early deployment and use characteristics. Through developer APIs, LocAssure can provide critical security support for a broad range of indoor location applications.

However, privacy concerns regarding handling of sensitive user location data potentially disrupt the adoption of such systems. This paper presents AnonyCast, a novel privacy-aware mechanism for delivering precise location information measured by crowd-tracking systems to individual pedestrians' smartphones. AnonyCast uses sparsely placed Bluetooth Low Energy transmitters to advertise location-dependent, time-varying keys. Using location measurements, AnonyCast estimates a subset of keys that each pedestrian's phone receives along its path. By combining a cryptography scheme called CP-ABE with a novel greedy algorithm for key selection, it encrypts each path before publishing, allowing users to decrypt only their own trajectories. The results from field experiments show that AnonyCast delivers accurate locations over 84% of time, bounding probability of unauthorized access to one's location below 1%.

These devices are typically configured in connection-oriented hub-and-spoke model with the Master controller. With an end-objective of optimizing the capacity of BLE (Bluetooth Low Energy) centric systems, we share analytical models, experimental setup and experimental validation of these models. Using a current consumption model for commercially available BLE devices, analytical models are developed to obtain closed form expressions for performance metric like Current Consumption and Quality of Service. (QoS in BLE context will be impacted by Application Delay, Overall end-to-end Reliability, throughput, and Stability region). The work presented in this paper provides a way for Smartphones to control the Duration of Usage (DoU) of the connected accessories, while achieving a graceful application performance. Models presented in the paper capture both, connection-oriented and broadcast-based BLE communications systems. These models explicitly account for the system parameters such as data generation rate, communication buffer available at the Slave device, relative offsets in anchor points provided by Master to different connections, etc. These models feed into an adaptation algorithm running in the Master device to dynamically configure BLE connection parameters.

Selection Probability of Data Channels in Bluetooth Low Energy	2015 INTERNATIONAL WIRELESS COMMUNICATIONS & MOBILE COMPUTING CONFERENCE (IWCMC)	International Wireless Communications and Mobile Computing Conference		English	Proceedings Paper	11th IEEE International Wireless Communications and Mobile Computing Conference (IEEE IWCMC)	AUG 24-25, 2015	Dubrovnik, CROATIA	IEEE, IEEE Croatia Sect, Univ Dubrovnik				Bluetooth Low Energy (BLE) is a ubiquitous technology allowing applications in healthcare, wellness and household sensors to have wireless functionality. Even though a frequency hopping mechanism is employed by BLE to combat fading and interference in the 2.4 GHz Industrial, Scientific and Medical (ISM) band, a noticeable probability of collision is expected to arise when the number of communicating BLE devices in the same vicinity increases. In this paper, an analytical model to find the selection probability of each of the 37 BLE data channels is presented. The results, which are confirmed by brute-force simulation, are then used to find the probability of collision between collocated BLE pairs and their maximum achievable aggregate throughput.

Dynamic threshold adjustment in a proximity-based location tracking system using reference modules	2015 INTERNATIONAL WIRELESS COMMUNICATIONS & MOBILE COMPUTING CONFERENCE (IWCMC)	International Wireless Communications and Mobile Computing Conference		English	Proceedings Paper	11th IEEE International Wireless Communications and Mobile Computing Conference (IEEE IWCMC)	AUG 24-25, 2015	Dubrovnik, CROATIA	IEEE, IEEE Croatia Sect, Univ Dubrovnik		Bluetooth; Bluetooth Low Energy; Correlation; Correlation Coefficient; Dynamic; Kalman Filter; Location; Location Tracking; Path Loss Exponent; Proximity; Received Signal Strength; Reference Module; RSSI; Signal Strength Fluctuation; Threshold; Tracking		In recent years, location tracking systems have become important in areas such as transportation, shopping, logistics and medicine. One of the most recent approaches are proximity-based location tracking systems, which use the received signal strength (RSSI) measured between a sender and an anchor module. The advantages of these systems are high scalability, minimal calibration effort and low costs. However, there are also disadvantages e.g. the fluctuating signal strength under certain circumstances in the environment. To detect, if an object has entered a predefined region, the RSSI must exceed a specified threshold. When the current signal fluctuates due to obstacles (other objects, people, etc.) the static threshold does not apply for the defined region any longer. In this case automatic adjustments of the threshold are made with the help of a reference module. Various factors are measured between reference, anchor as well as a sender module and subsequently used to correct the static threshold. The dynamic adjustment was tested through three experiments and showed satisfactory results concerning the hypotheses. For further research, additional factors might need to be included to make the proposed method more dynamic and responsive to the environment.

The combination of a gateway and devices with a wireless connection can provide flexibility, but there are limitations to the network capability of each gateway in terms of how many network connections can be accommodated. It would be possible to get rid of the constraint and provide further flexibility and stability if we could deal with multiple gateways and balance the connections. Therefore, we propose a dynamic reconfigurable wireless connection system that can hand over the device connection between gateways by introducing a driver management framework that migrates the driver module handling the network connection. We have implemented a prototype using smartphones as gateways, Bluetooth low energy (BLE) sensors as devices, and a Web application that works on an extended Web runtime that can directly control a device from the application. The combination of these, composed by the user, can be migrated from the smartphone to other gateways (including the network connection) by dragging and dropping icons, after which the gateway and devices take over the combined task. We confirmed that the proposed architecture enables end users to utilize devices flexibly and can easily migrate the network connections of a particular service to another gateway.

The capability to provide the users with added-value services through low-power and low-cost smart objects is very attractive in many fields. Among these, art and culture represent very interesting examples, as the tourism is one of the main driving engines of modern society. In this paper, we propose an IoT-aware architecture to improve the cultural experience of the user, by involving the most important recent innovations in the ICT field. The main components of the proposed architecture are: (i) an indoor localization service based on the Bluetooth Low Energy technology, (ii) a wearable device able to capture and process images related to the user's point of view, (iii) the user's mobile device useful to display customized cultural contents and to share multimedia data in the Cloud, and (iv) a processing center that manage the core of the whole business logic. In particular, it interacts with both wearable and mobile devices, and communicates with the outside world to retrieve contents from the Cloud and to provide services also to external users. The proposal is currently under development and it will be validated in the MUST museum in Lecce.
